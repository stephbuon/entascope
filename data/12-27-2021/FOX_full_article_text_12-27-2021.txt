Here's what you need to know as you start your day …Fauci says idea of taking masks off airplanes 'not something we should even be considering'Dr.Anthony Fauci, the longtime director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, on Sunday said that taking masks off while on anairplaneis "not something we should even be considering."Fauci made the comments on ABC's This Week while responding to a question from Jonathan Karl on a vaccine mandate for domestic air travel."We want to make sure people keep their masks on. I think the idea of taking masks off, in my mind, is really not something we should even be considering," Fauci said.During a U.S. Senate panel hearing on Dec. 15, Southwest Airlines CEO Gary Kelly said that masks "don’t add much, if anything" to fight the spread of COVID-19 on airplanes.On Sunday, Fauci also signaled that a vaccine mandate for domestic air travel could work as a mechanism for individuals to get vaccinated."A vaccine requirement for a person getting on the plane is just another level of getting people to have a mechanism that would spur them to get vaccinated; namely, you can't get on a plane unless you're vaccinated, which is just another one of the ways of getting requirements, whatever that might be," Fauci said.CLICK HERE FOR MORE ON OUR TOP STORY.In other developments- Woman arrested at Atlanta airport after allegedlyhitting manfor not wearing mask: report- France COVID casessurgeto 100,000- Hundreds of flights stillgetting canceledas omicron surge slams airline crews, derails holiday travel- NBA should avoidhittingpauseon season unless COVID outbreaks affect fans, analyst says- Health expert: Schoolclosures'shouldn't even be on the table' despite omicron- CNN religious commentatoradvisesunvaccinated people not to attend church- Connecticut coronavirus caseslinkedto Dem governor’s holiday party: reportsMainstream media fume over dad saying 'Let's Go Brandon' to BidenMedia pundits spent much of Christmas weekend berating a father who yelled "Let’s Go Brandon" atPresident Bidenon Christmas Eve.President Biden and First Lady Jill Biden took part in a "Santa Tracker" event with NORAD officials on Friday to speak with callers tracking Santa Claus for Christmas. One caller who identified as Jared from Oregonended his family’s callby saying "Let’s Go Brandon," a phrase usually intended as a disparagement against the president.The phrase "Let’s Go Brandon"emergedafter a reporter claimed that NASCAR fans shouting the phrase "F--- Joe Biden" were actually saying "Let’s Go Brandon" in reaction to driver Brandon Brown. It has since become a media sensation to mock the president and media reporters who slam Biden critics.Mainstream media journalists have since treated the phrase as "vulgar" and "vitriol," going so far as tocomparepeople who use the phrase to ISIS sympathizers. The pattern continued after reporters identified the man as Jared Schmeck, a former Oregon police officer who has sinceinsistedthat the phrase was made "in a joking manner."In the past, there were several instances of people publicly disparagingPresident Donald Trumpor yelling "F--- Donald Trump" in public.

"Thanks to my administration, the hard work of Americans … our rollout made America among the world leaders in getting shots in arms."In an exclusive interview with Fox News on Tuesday evening, Trump reacted to Biden acknowledging his administration’s efforts."I'm very appreciative of that — I was surprised to hear it," Trump told Fox News. "I think it was a terrific thing, and I think it makes a lot of people happy."Trump then repeated that he was "a little bit surprised.""I think he did something very good," Trump said.

"But I want to get things done. I still think there's a possibility of getting Build Back Better done."The exchanges came after a drama-filled week featuring the president and the West Virginia Democrat, with Biden releasing a statementsingling out Manchinfor the delay in passing his massive legislation, a move that reportedly helped prompt the senator to completelycut off negotiationswith the White House."I've done everything humanly possible," Manchin said during an appearance on Fox News over the weekend, where he announced his opposition to Biden's plan.

"You should not hesitate to re-examine your views and change your opinion if you become convinced they are erroneous, but you should not surrender your honest opinion simply because other jurors disagree, or merely to reach a verdict."Potter's defense attorneys objected to Judge Chu rereading the jury instructions, arguing that it would emphasize that aspect of the instructions over everything else. The judge overruled the objection.The jury – which consists of nine White people, two Asian people, and one Black person – deliberated for a little more than five hours on Monday after closing arguments.

"We are unable to provide additional information because this is pending criminal matter."Federal prosecutors said McClain organized and assisted his teammates in filing fraudulent claims for unemployment benefits under the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA), a program established by Congress to help reduce the economic fallout caused by the pandemic.The claims were filed with California's Employment Development Department (EDD) using false information about the players' prior employment. They also lied about job losses related to the pandemic and their supposed efforts in seeking employment in California, prosecutors said.They allegedly claimed they were athletic trainers and tutors whose employment had been negatively impacted by the pandemic. In total, 36 applications were filed and nearly $230,000 in benefits were paid out.The applications sought more than $903,000 in funds, according to court documents.The false claims resulted in Bank of America issuing debit cards in the names of the claimants.

Here's what you need to know as you start your day …Biden was in 'close contact' with staffer who tested positive for COVID-19President Bidenhad a "close contact" with a staff member who has tested positive forCOVID-19, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said in a statement on Monday."On Monday morning, a mid-level staff member, who does not regularly have contact with the President, received a positive result for a COVID-19 test," Psaki said in a statement. " Three days earlier, on Friday, that staff member had spent approximately 30 minutes in proximity to the President on Air Force One, on the way from Orange, South Carolina to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."Psaki added that Biden "is tested on a regular basis." On Sunday, he tested negative in an antigen test. "This morning, after being notified of the staffer’s positive test, the President received a PCR test and tested negative. He will be tested again on Wednesday.""Others on Air Force One who were in close contact with this staff member are being contacted and will be advised to get tested per CDC guidance," she added.The White House revealed that the staff member who tested positive "is fully vaccinated and boosted, and tested negative prior to boarding Air Force One, as is required for everyone traveling with the President. This staff member did not begin to experience symptomsuntil Sunday, and was tested on Monday.""The president has a full schedule today and is not in need of quarantine," she said. "We will provide information to all of you as outlined with our commitment from just a few months ago about being transparent, about close contacts. I don't have any updates for you at this point in time. But again, we expect there to be breakthrough cases across the country, right?

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.The nation’s second-largest city called off itsNew Year’s Evecelebration Monday, and its smallest state re-imposed an indoor mask mandate as fears of a potentially devastating winter COVID-19 surge triggered more cancellations and restrictions ahead of the holidays.Organizers of the New Year’s Eve party planned for downtownLos Angeles’ Grand Park say there will not be an in-person audience. The event will be livestreamed instead, as it was last year. InRhode Island, a mask mandate took effect Monday for indoor spaces that can hold 250 people or more, such as larger retail stores and churches.NEW YORK ORDERS MASK MANDATE FOR INDOOR PUBLIC SPACES STATEWIDEAnd inBoston, the city’s new Democratic mayor announced to howls of protests and jeers that anyone entering arestaurant, bar or other indoor business will need to show proof ofvaccinationstarting next month."There is nothing more American than coming together to ensure that we’re taking care of each other," Mayor Michelle Wu said at City Hall as protesters loudly blew whistles and shouted "Shame on Wu."Across the Atlantic, British Prime MinisterBoris Johnsonon Monday said officials have decided against imposing further restrictions, at least for now."We will have to reserve the possibility of taking further action to protect the public," Johnson said. "The arguments either way are very, very finely balanced."The conservative government re-imposed face masks in shops and ordered people to show proof of vaccination at nightclubs and other crowded venues earlier this month. It is also weighing curfews and stricter social distancing requirements.Johnson’s warning threw into stark relief the unpalatable choice government leaders face: wreckholidayplans for millions for a second consecutive year, or face a potential tidal wave of cases and disruption.CALIFORNIA TO REIMPOSE UNIVERSAL INDOOR MASK MANDATEIn theU.S.,President Joe Bidenis set to address the nation on the latest variant on Tuesday, less than a year after he suggested that the country would essentially be back to normal by Christmas.His top medical adviser, Dr. Anthony Fauci, made the rounds on television over the weekend, promising that the Democrat will issue "a stark warning of what the winter will look like" for unvaccinated Americans.People wait in a long line to get tested for COVID-19 in Times Square, New York, Monday, Dec. 20, 2021. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig)Cases are surging in parts of the U.S., particularly the Northeast and Midwest, though it’s not always clear which variant is driving the upswing.In New York City, where the mayor has said the new variant is already in "full force," a spike is scuttling Broadway shows and spurring long lines at testing centers, but so far new hospitalizations and deaths are averaging well below their spring 2020 peak.The city is also weighing what to do with its famous New Year's Eve bash in Times Square. Mayor Bill de Blasio has said a decision will be made this week about whether the event will come back "full strength" — with attendees providing proof of vaccination — as he promised in November. Last year’s bash was limited to small groups of essential workers.Much about the omicron coronavirus variant remains unknown, including whether it causes more or less severe illness. Scientists say omicron spreads even easier than other coronavirus strains, including delta, and it is expected to become dominant in the U.S. by early next year. Early studies suggest the vaccinated will need a booster shot for the best chance at preventing an omicron infection but even without the extra dose, vaccination still should offer strong protection against severe illness and death.DESPITE NYC'S SEVERE COVID RESTRICTIONS, OUTCOME NO DIFFERENT THAN ANYWHERE ELSE EXCEPT UNEMPLOYMENTEven if it is milder, the new variant could still overwhelm health systems because of the sheer number of infections. Confirmed coronavirus cases in the U.K. have surged by 60% in a week as omicron overtook delta as the dominant variant.But many political leaders are reluctant to impose the stiff measures they resorted to earlier in the pandemic — often because they promised their people that vaccines would offer a way out of such restrictions, and it may be politically untenable to impose them again.France, for example, is desperately trying to avoid a new lockdown that would hurt the economy and cloud President Emmanuel Macron’s expected re-election campaign.In Britain, the government hopes vaccine boosters will offer more protection against omicron, as the data suggests, and has set a goal of offering everyone 18 and up an extra shot by the end of December. More than 900,000 booster shots were delivered on Sunday, as soccer stadiums, shopping centers and cathedrals were turned into temporary inoculation clinics.U.S. vaccine maker Moderna said Monday that lab tests suggested that a booster dose of its vaccine should offer protection against omicron. Similar testing by Pfizer also found that a booster triggered a big jump in omicron-fighting antibodies.But many scientists say boosters along are not enough and tougher action is needed.COVID-19 PANDEMIC PARADOX: PEOPLE FEEL POWERLESS DESPITE UNPRECEDENTED SCIENTIFIC PROGRESSThe speed of omicron’s spread in the U.K., where cases of the variant are doubling about every two days, is decimating the economy in the busy pre-Christmas period.Usually teeming theaters and restaurants are being hit by cancellations. Some eateries and pubs have closed until after the holidays because so many staff are off sick or self-isolating. The Natural History Museum, one of London's leading attractions, said Monday that it was closing for a week because of staff shortages.Other countries are warily watching the U.K., which reported 91,743 more lab-confirmed COVID-19 cases on Monday, close to the record high for a single day set last week.The Dutch government began a tough nationwide lockdown on Sunday to rein in sharply rising infections. The World Economic Forum, meanwhile, announced Monday that it is again delaying its annual meeting of world leaders, business executives and other elites in Davos, Switzerland, because of omicron uncertainty.But many European leaders have opted for something less.France and Germany have barred most British travelers from entering, and the government in Paris has also banned public concerts and fireworks displays at New Year’s celebrations. Ireland imposed an 8 p.m. curfew on pubs and bars and limited attendance at indoor and outdoor events, while Greece will have 10,000 police officers on duty over the holidays to carry out COVID pass checks.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPIn Spain, the national average of new cases is double what it was a year ago. But authorities in the country with one of Europe’s highest vaccination rates are betting primarily on mandatory mask-wearing indoors and the rollout of booster shots, with no further restrictions planned.Neighboring Portugal is telling most nonessential workers to work from home for a week in January, but the country has no other new measures in the pipeline.Hendrik Wuest, governor of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany’s most populous state, said more restrictions could be on the horizon shortly after Christmas."I don’t think big New Year parties can happen this year — unfortunately, again," he added. "Omicron won’t forgive us any carelessness if we aren’t cautious."Get all the stories you need-to-know from the most powerful name in news delivered first thing every morning to your inboxSubscribedYou've successfully subscribed to this newsletter!This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2022 FOX News Network, LLC.

The previous record was set on Jan. 14, when there were19,942 reported new cases.As cases rise, New York City – as well as the state – had already enacted strict mandates on vaccines and other requirements to avoid such spikes.New York's Mayor Bill de Blasio speaks at a mass vaccination site at Yankee Stadium in New York City on Feb. 5, 2021.(REUTERS/Carlo Allegri)All city workers were mandated to get the vaccine;people dining indoors, going to the gym or visiting venues such as museums or concert halls must show proof of vaccination; children ages 5 to 11 are required to show proof of vaccination to participate in indoor activities; masks were made mandatory again indoors last month.This week, all employees of private schools – such as Catholic schools and yeshivas – were mandated to be vaccinated in the city.NYC MAYOR DE BLASIO ANNOUNCES COVID-19 VACCINE MANDATE FOR PRIVATE SECTOR WORKERSAnother mandate for all private employees working in the Big Apple requires them to show proof of at least one dose of the vaccine by Dec. 27. The mandate does not include giving employees the option to get regularly tested instead of receiving the shots.Some in the city have pointed to the annual SantaCon, which was held on Dec. 11 and featured thousands of people dressed as Santa Claus in a massive pub crawl, for the spike in cases."Be especially cautious about indoor gatherings where masks come off. (And yes SantaCon may partly be to blame.)," Mark Levin, the chair of the city's health commission, tweeted Saturday.Dr. Marc Siegel, a Fox News contributor and professor of medicine at the NYU Langone Medical Center, told Fox News Digital on Monday that it’s possible SantaCon is behind the spike, but it’s "far more likely" indoor gatherings are to blame due to omicron "swarming."Despite vaccine passports to participate in virtually all public events in the city and other strict requirements, New York is struggling with the spike in cases similar to states that have little to no mandates.In Florida, coronavirus cases have more thandoubled in the last week. While in Texas,health officials are bracingfor a spike. And in Georgia, 3,094 new caseswere reported Friday, the highest number of new cases in months.Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has been one of the most vocal state leaders in the nation to denounce mandates and restrictions implemented in other states, vowing repeatedly to keep his state and jobs open.Gov. Ron DeSantis speaks at the opening of a monoclonal antibody site on Aug. 18, 2021, in Pembroke Pines, Florida.(AP Photo/Marta Lavandier)NEW YORKERS REACT TO DE BLASIO'S VACCINE MANDATES ON PRIVATE SECTOR: 'DISASTER' OR 'ABOUT TIME'?"I told Floridians that we would protect their jobs, and today we made that the law,"DeSantis saidin a press release last month after signing multiple bills regarding vaccine mandates. "Nobody should lose their job due to heavy-handed COVID mandates, and we had a responsibility to protect the livelihoods of the people of Florida. I’m thankful to the Florida Legislature for joining me in standing up for freedom."The vow to protect jobs is reflected in unemployment data in the state. In the metro area of Florida’s largest city, Jacksonville, unemployment fell to 3.3% in November. The state’s overall unemployment sat at 4.5% in November, down0.1% from October.In New York City, the unemployment rate remains well ahead of the national average. The city’s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate sat at9% in November, more than double the national unemployment rate of 4.2%. The figure is also higher than the state’s unemployment rate of6.6% in November, which is down from October’s 6.9%.New York's death rate per 100,000 people is also similar to Florida's, despite the Sunshine State's spike in cases over the summer. As of Dec. 16,New York shows a death rate of 300per 100,000 people compared to Florida's 289 per 100,000 people.Cities in Texas and Georgia also both enjoy lower unemployment than in New York.Atlanta’s unemployment fell to2.4% in October. The state’s overall unemployment fell to a new record low last month to 2.8%.In Houston, unemployment sat at5.1% in November,down from 7.9% during the same month last year. While Texas’ seasonally adjusted unemployment rate ticked down to5.2% in November. The figures are still, however, higher than the national average.South Dakota, which also resisted strict coronavirus restrictions, is seeinglow unemployment of 2.7%last month.New York, New York (iStock)(iStock)In New York City, business owners are sounding off on the strict requirements and renewed measures, saying they’re being required to police their patrons on following the city’s restrictions.NYC BUSINESS OWNER SLAMS 'RIDICULOUS' VACCINE REQUIREMENT FOR PATRONS: 'DOING MORE HARM THAN GOOD'"The mayor is asking store owners, business owners, restaurant owners to start policing people as they come into a restaurant to sit down," Mary Josephine Generoso, manager of bakery Pasticceria Rocco in Brooklyn, told Fox News earlier this month."It’s infringing on our liberties," she told Fox News’Brian Kilmeade.Mayor Bill de Blasio attends the opening of a vaccination center for Broadway workers in Times Square on April 12, 2021.(Noam Galai/Getty Images)Job Creators Network president and CEO Alfredo Ortiz also toldFOX Businessthis month that de Blasio’s mandate requiring private businesses to force all employees to get vaccinated is his "final insult" to business owners before leaving office next month.NYC BUSINESS OWNERS REACT TO DE BLASIO’S VACCINE MANDATE"His vaccine requirement on city employers of all sizes will exacerbate the historic labor shortage plaguing small businesses and comes at the worst possible time during the busy holiday season," Ortiz said. "It is a final insult to Big Apple job creators. Thankfully for New York City small businesses, de Blasio will soon be gone.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.More than 12,000militaryservice members refusing theCOVID-19vaccineare seekingreligiousexemptions, and so far they are having zero success.That total lack of approvals is creating new tensions within the military, even as the vast majority of the armed forces have gotten vaccinated.The services, urgently trying to keep the coronavirus pandemic in check by getting troops vaccinated, are now besieged with exemption requests they are unlikely to approve. Meanwhile, troops claiming religious reasons for avoiding the shots are perplexed because exemptions are theoretically available, yet seem impossible to obtain.Caught in the middle are chaplains, who must balance the desire to offer compassionate care and guidance to personnel with the need to explain a complicated process that may well be futile. They also must assess requests from those who may be using religion as an excuse to avoid a vaccine that, while credited with preventing needless deaths, has become politically charged.Head National Guard chaplain Col. Larry Bazer, deputy director of the chaplain office, left, and Chaplain Maj. A'Shellarien Lang, right, speak at the National Guard Bureau in Arlington, Va., Friday, Dec. 17, 2021. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)"So many of them come in thinking that I make the decision, and if they make this case, that it’s a done deal," said Maj. A'Shellarien Lang, an Army chaplain for the National Guard. "I don’t make the decision. And so when they find that out, it’s a kind of game-changer in the sense that they know that the process has to continue."According to the services, at least 30,000 service members are not yet vaccinated, but several thousand of those have gotten temporary or permanent medical or administrative exemptions approved. Of the remaining — which is likely 20,000 or more — thousands are working their way through the exemptions process, such as for religious reasons, or have flatly refused. That’s about 1.5% of the roughly 1.3 million active duty troops.COVID-19 VACCINE MANDATE: MILITARY BEGINS DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS AGAINST REFUSERSObtaining a religious exemption is rooted in a process that predates the pandemic and has been used for decisions such as whether troops on duty can wear head coverings or beards for religious reasons.In addition to discussions with chaplains to determine whether they have a "sincerely held belief," troops must meet with commanders and medical personnel. The final decision is made higher up the chain of command and is also based on whether the person’s vaccine exemption will pose a risk to mission accomplishment, unit cohesion, the health and safety of the force, and military readiness.Even in the past, few troops have cleared those hurdles to get religious exemptions. And because the pandemic can directly affect the force's health and readiness, the bar is even higher, so military leaders aren’t surprised by the lack of approved exemptions.Head National Guard chaplain Col. Larry Bazer, deputy director of the chaplain office, left, and Chaplain Maj. A'Shellarien Lang, right, speak together at the National Guard Bureau in Arlington, Va., Friday, Dec. 17, 2021. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)But for the troops and chaplains, it's been a bit overwhelming."It’s just been a lot of interviews, a lot of memos," Lang said. "I find that my colleagues are stressed just because of the logistics of getting the memo done and having to make sure they’re keeping up with the process. It’s like rapid fire."Air Force officials initially said religious exemption requests would be answered in 30 days. But they have gotten more than 4,700 requests — far more than the other military services, and the logistics of the lengthy review process has made it difficult to meet that timeline. The Navy has received about 2,700 religious exemption requests, the Marine Corps has 3,100 and the Army about 1,700. Some that were rejected have been appealed, but there is little data on that."We did not expect the surge of requests," said Air Force Col. Paul Sutter, chief chaplain for religious affairs at Space Force, which is included in the Air Force.BIDEN ADMINISTRATION MOVES AHEAD WITH EMPLOYEE COVID-19 VACCINE MANDATE, AS STATES APPEAL TO THE SUPREME COURTAn Air Force reservist who requested a religious exemption said she's aware of none approved so far, and she is not optimistic. The reservist, who asked that her name be withheld for privacy reasons, said her chaplain was very straightforward, laying out the process and noting the lack of approvals.Still, she said, she believes "God has a plan for my life."Sutter and Col. Larry Bazer, deputy director of the National Guard’s joint chaplain office, said they tell their chaplains to be impartial as they speak with service members and to follow the process."Meet the member where they are. Let them articulate who they are, how they believe and how they live out that faith," Sutter said he advises chaplains. "We’re just looking for their articulation of their deeply held beliefs. You’re looking for a consistency in how they adhere to those beliefs."Lang, who has done more than 50 interviews, said a key question she asks is what service members plan to do if their request is denied — a possibility some don’t expect.Head National Guard chaplain Col. Larry Bazer, deputy director of the chaplain office, left, and Chaplain Maj. A'Shellarien Lang, right, speak at the National Guard Bureau in Arlington, Va., Friday, Dec. 17, 2021. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)She said some troops believe God doesn't want them vaccinated and are torn by what they see as a contradiction if God somehow doesn't ensure they get the exemption."If in their heart and their mind, they say this is God’s will for my life, and if the answer is no, it’s going to shatter that faith because there’s no balance. There’s no room for God to say no," she said. "When I create the space to say what if God says no, then that opens up another whole level of faith conversation."The Air Force reservist who spoke on condition of anonymity said she was raised a Christian and is willing to retire if her request isn’t granted, even though it would mean giving up her G.I. Bill tuition benefits that she would get if she stayed another year or more."I will have to forfeit that," said the mother of three children, including a newborn. Forgoing the tuition benefit, which she could transfer to her children, is worth it, she said. "I have no doubt God will provide for me."The reservist, whose husband is in the Army and is vaccinated, was pregnant when the vaccine came out, and she was concerned about a possible reaction. Health officials have asserted it is safe for pregnant women, but in some cases the military has granted temporary exemptions to women. The reservist said her opposition is rooted in her faith, including concerns that some vaccines were tested on fetal cell lines developed over decades. The vaccines don’t contain fetal material.MUST EMPLOYERS FOLLOW BIDEN'S VACCINE MANDATES?The Vatican has deemed it "morally acceptable" for Catholics to get the shot and other Christian faiths have done the same. But some religious leaders have offered exemption letter templates and voiced support for vaccine avoidance.The services, in many cases, provided chaplains with interview questions such as whether the service member’s "pattern of conduct" is consistent, whether the member routinely complies with religious practices and whether the member participates in activities "associated with the belief."Chaplains also take into account whether service members previously received religious accommodations."I don’t really dig into how long they’ve been in church and all of that kind of stuff because it’s really about their current reality of what they really believe," Lang said. "And in that moment — let’s suppose it’s a political decision, but they wrap it in religiosity — that’s still what they believe in that moment."The chaplains said the interviews have had the side benefit of making troops more aware that religious personnel are available and that the meetings are triggering longer conversations about other issues."It's really been a bridge to just some greater ministry," Lang said.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPChaplains also are reaching out to each other for support. The past two years have been challenging for them as they worked with troops facing a wide range of struggles — from COVID-19 losses, job pressures, racial unrest and protests, and deployments."It really has been a major stress on our chaplain corps - just to be there as their chaplain," said Bazer, a rabbi. "Overall folks are good, but folks are tired. I think our faith gives us that extra strength to keep us going — it’s that spiritual adrenaline push."Get all the stories you need-to-know from the most powerful name in news delivered first thing every morning to your inboxSubscribedYou've successfully subscribed to this newsletter!This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2022 FOX News Network, LLC.

Here’s what you need to know as you start your day …Biden warns unvaccinated Americans facing winter of 'severe illness and death'PresidentBidensaid Thursday that Americans unvaccinated against thecoronavirusare facing a winter of "severe illness and death.""It’s here now and it’s spreading and it’s going to increase," the presidentsaidabout the omicron variant while meeting with his coronavirus response team. "For unvaccinated we are looking at a winter of severe illness and death if you’re unvaccinated for themselves, their families, and the hospitals they will soon overwhelm.""But, there’s good news," Biden added. "If you’re vaccinated and have your booster shot you’re protected from severe illness and death."Biden’s warning comes almost a year into his presidency afterrepeatingmany times on the campaign trail that he was the candidate who would "shut down the virus" and blaming former President Trump for his "ineptitude" in slowing the spread.On Wednesday, CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said she expected reports of omicron cases in the U.S. to increase in the coming days.The "variant of concern" has been detected in at least 36 states. Agency data based on national genomic sequencing analysis shows the omicron variant is estimated to represent around 3% of coronavirus cases in the U.S., including higher estimates inNew YorkandNew Jersey.Somehealth officialshave expressed reserved optimism that the coronavirusomicron straincould be a significant step in the pandemic's transition to becoming endemic, with one expert calling initial studies "the ideal situation for a virus."CLICK HERE FOR MORE ON OUR TOP STORY.In other developments:- Francerestrictstravel from Britain to fight omicron- Dogs, cats, andotheranimalsare contracting COVID-19- Dana PerinosuggestsBiden has failed to use 'vaccine diplomacy' to tackle COVID- The Atlantic calls out CDC's 'flawed case' for school masking: Its go-to study based on 'very shaky science'- CNN guestadvisespeople to wear masks at Christmas whether 'vaccinated or not'- Biden adminasksSupreme Court to reinstate mandates for many health care workersWhite House: Biden plans to run for reelection with Harris in 2024President Bidenintends to run for reelection in 2024 with Vice PresidentKamala Harrisas his running mate, White House deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Thursday.Jean-Pierre disclosed the president's plans when she was asked about a recent report fromThe Wall Street Journalin which Harris was asked if Biden intended to seek a second term."She didn't say yes," ABC News senior White House correspondent Mary K. Bruce noted. "She just said that the two of them hadn't talked about it. Of course, you all and the president himself has said that he does plan to seek reelection. So what's the disconnect here?""Well, I mean, I can't speak to a conversation that the vice president and the president have," Jean-Pierre replied. "I could only say what and reiterate what Jen [Psaki] has said, and what the president has said himself, that he is planning to run for reelection in 2024.

Mexico and China are the primary sources for the flow of fentanyl into the United States, according to theDrug Enforcement Agency (DEA).Comparatively, between Jan. 1, 2020, and Dec. 15, 2021, there were more than 53,000 COVID-19 deaths among those between ages 18 and 49, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)."This is a national emergency. America’s young adults — thousands of unsuspecting Americans — are being poisoned," James Rauh, founder of Families Against Fentanyl, said in a statement. "It is widely known that illicit fentanyl is driving the massive spike in drug-related deaths. A new approach to this catastrophe is needed."In the first five months of 2021 alone, more than 42,600 fentanyl overdose deaths were reported, which represents an increase of more than 1,000 fentanyl deaths per month compared to the same time period in 2020.CLICK HERE FOR MORE.In other developments:- CBP officers in Texasseizemore than $3M worth of methamphetamine at US-Mexico border- Los Angeles police looking for 'Two O’Clock Rock' burglar who places rock in front of targeted businesses- New York AG looking into man's death weeks after heburst into flamesin case involving stun gun, hand sanitizer- Jacqueline Avant’s suspected killer pleadsnot guiltyto fatal shooting during alleged home invasion- Baltimore policeidentifyofficer on life support after she was ambushed and shot- UScarried out11 executions in 2021, fewest since 1988, report saysCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPTODAY'S MUST-READS:- Urban Meyer's daughter vows 'war' after NFL's Jaguars fire coach- Salvation Army 'Red Kettle' donationslaggingafter posting racism guide- Keanu Reevesrevealshow he was really feeling at time of viral 'sad' photo- Connecticut school board meetingboils overresulting in board member being punched in face- HarvardwaivesACT, SAT admission requirement for graduating classes through 2030- NBC anchorshitNancy Pelosi for comments about how lawmakers should be able to trade individual stocksTHE LATEST FROM FOX BUSINESS:- Kellogg'sreachestentative agreement with striking workers- State Farmaccusedof discrimination by former employee- Morgan Stanleytellingworkers to stay home through the end of the year- Garlandpraisescourt for rejecting Purdue Pharma’s bankruptcy settlement- California utilityfaces$550M in penalties for 5 wildfires- Fox Business Poll: Highercrimeratesacross the US a large concern for voters- Real estate companyreleasesprojections for hottest housing marketsSOME PARTING WORDSFox Business'Mike Roweon Thursday night argued that the low U.S. labor participation rate paired with high unemployment is a "matter of national security."Rowe, host of Discovery Channel’s "Dirty Jobs," who often advocates for Americans to pursue jobs in the trades, issued the warning during an appearance on "Tucker Carlson Tonight.""This is no longer a matter of a skills gap or a few million people unemployed and employers frustrated because of the mismatching skills," Rowe said.

But their decision also altered the Nov. 30 ruling by U.S. District Judge Terry Doughty that blocked the vaccine mandate nationwide, meaning it can be forced in half the country.BIDEN HIT WITH STRING OF LEGAL LOSSES ON VACCINE MANDATE AS DOJ VOWS TO ‘VIGOROUSLY DEFEND’ IT IN COURTThe appeals court panel noted that the matter will likely make it to the U.S. Supreme Court."We believe, like the majority of health systems nationwide, that requiring the vaccine is the right thing to do to protect our patients and staff from COVID-19 and are moving forward with our decision to require the COVID-19 vaccine or have an approved medical or religious exemption," OhioHealth said in a statement. "Our process was developed to ensure compliance with state and federal law."The Ohio Hospital Association tracked a more than 50% increase in COVID-19 hospitalizations over the past 60 days.(Stephen Zenner/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)"However, given the recent regulatory and legislative issues we are pausing our timeline," it said. "We are not changing our mandate process, but we are pausing on the timeline at this point."The Ohio Hospital Association, which has member hospitals statewide, tracked a more than 50% increase in COVID-19 hospitalizations over the past 60 days. The ICU 60-day change has increased by 30%, with one in four patients in the ICUs being COVID-19 positive and receiving COVID-19 treatment, John Palmer, OHA director of Media and Public Relations, told Fox News Digital by phone.At least three of the Ohio Hospital Association’s members, meanwhile, have moved to pause the implementation of the vaccine mandate for their health care employees. But Palmer said that move came in response to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services announcement that they were pausing enforcement due to pending litigation – not to any reactions by staff members.More than 760 patients are on ventilators in Ohio hospitals this week, Palmer said, which requires 24-7 care and demands more hospital resources related to equipment, materials and bed space. Palmer also detailed how health care workers are experiencing "burnout" related to a 22-month, roughly two-year pandemic operation with high capacity in particular months.Ohio has seen about five surges of COVID-19 cases throughout the pandemic so far, he said.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPPresident Biden in November issued an executive order requiring all health care workers at facilities participating in Medicare or Medicaid to be fully vaccinated with either two doses of Pfizer or Moderna, or one dose of Johnson & Johnson by Jan. 4.The rule would apply to more than 17 million workers at approximately 76,000 health care facilities, including hospitals and long-term care facilities, according to the Biden administration.Danielle Wallace is a reporter for Fox News Digital covering politics, crime, police and more.

"They're saying it's a state law that they cannot come in."FIREFIGHTERS RESCUE OHIO DOG TRAPPED BETWEEN CONCRETE WALLSThe officer then encountered multiple staff members performing CPR and other life-saving measures on the patient.

Keep going," the officer told one exhausted staff member as she continued CPR.The officer who entered the care facility encountered multiple frantic staff members performing CPR on the patient.(Rialto Police Department)As the officer navigated the wheel-less bed through the hallways, they eventually came into view of the paramedics."Despite being in their line of sight, fire personnel still insisted on [redacted] being brought to them outside before they began life saving efforts and made no effort to assist me in getting [redacted] outside."Once they finally got the man outside, several other emergency medical personnel had arrived and started treating the man as one of the original paramedics peppered staff with administrative questions.The man was transferred to a local hospital and pronounced deceased about 30 minutes later.A staff member continues CPR outside the care center.(Rialto Police Department)The responding officer wrote that after the incident he asked fire personnel about the law and they said it "was ‘some COVID-19 law’ which had yet to be reversed."It is unclear what law the paramedics were citing when they refused to enter the facility.FOX 11 Los Angeles, who originally reported on the incident, said that the San Bernardino County Fire Chief’s Association sent out a memo in April 2020, informing departments that "all dispatch centers will be requesting the facilities to move patients to the door or outside the location."NY POLICE SHOOTS GUNMAN WHO WOUNDED 4 IN UPPER MANHATTANHowever, the memo also said that if the patient cannot be transferred, then "one member of Fire/EMS personnel should initially interact with the patient," according to the local news outlet.Rialto City Fire Department Acting Chief Brian Park said that multiple members of his department have been placed on leave pending an investigation due to the "troubling video footage.""Our Fire Department’s mission is to provide excellence in responding to medical emergencies through 'compassionate service.'

While faculty and staff case numbers currently remain low, just last evening our COVID-19 testing lab team identified evidence of the highly contagious omicron variant in a significant number of Monday’s positive student samples," Cornell's President Martha E.

PCR testing has identified its hallmark (the so-called S-gene dropout) in a substantial number of virus samples. While we must await confirmatory sequencing information to be sure that the source is omicron, we are proceeding as if it is," she added.Pollack called on the Ithaca campus to help limit further spread ahead of the end of the semester, including moving final examinations to an online format, canceling all university-sponsored events and activities involving undergraduates, canceling the Saturday recognition ceremony for December graduates, closing libraries and gyms, canceling Sunday athletics competitions and encouraging students to "grab-and-go" meals from Cornell Dining.Students who have tested negative within the past 48 hours are welcome to leave campus and must complete a departure checklist. Any student who has not tested negative should receive a supplemental test as soon as possible, the president instructed.Princeton, New Jersey - April 14, 2017: People wander around the Princeton University Campus during early spring.(iStock)Pollack said that Cornell would continue to assist on-campus residential students who have tested positive in safely isolating, that students should avoid nonessential contact with others, that visitors and guests are not allowed on campus with the exception of people picking up students for break and that mandatory surveillance testing would continue as normal for all employees currently enrolled.She noted that while there is still much unknown about omicron, it appears to be "significantly more transmissible than delta and other variants," with "some evidence" that it "generally causes milder cases, particularly among vaccinated individuals.""While I want to provide reassurance that, to date, we have not seen severe illness in any of our infected students, we do have a role to play in reducing the spread of the disease in the broader community," Pollack wrote."It is obviously extremely dispiriting to have to take these steps.

Given that we’ve seen an uptick in cases among undergraduates during the last 24 hours –including suspected cases of the highly contagious omicron variant – we hope to avoid letting the final exam schedule interfere with students’ travel home for winter break," the pair said in a letter. "We certainly don’t want you remaining on campus in required isolation through the holidays."Students in Continuous Housing over the winter break will be accommodated as planned, with athletic competitions proceeding with some mitigations and meals served as scheduled and with take-out options.People who are unable to change travel plans will be allowed to stay on campus until Dec. 23 at noon ET.Faculty were given the option to either keep the beginning time and date of the registrar-scheduled test but administer it remotely or turn the examination into a take-home due by Dec. 20."Because of this increase in cases, the entire Princeton community must now cancel or postpone all indoor gatherings with food, and those where face coverings can’t be worn, effective Thursday, December 16 through Friday, January 7, 2022.

(Credit: Pima County Sheriff's Department)"Our current staffing situation is terrible. I believe we've had the lowest numbers of officers currently in the last six, seven years. And as of right now, I believe we're sitting at approximately 365 corrections officers available," Dominguez said.Currently, according to Board of Supervisors member Rex Scott, 187 correctional officers are unvaccinated. He views the approved vaccine requirement as a reasonable measure since it doesn't apply to every county employee.Dominguez said that the Pima County Sheriff's Department has had "at least" 20 to 25 officers resign since the vaccine requirement was approved by the board of supervisors.He said that if the vaccine requirement stays in place and unvaccinated corrections officers are terminated on Jan. 1, there will be public safety concerns because of the inmates that could be released. Dominguez said that the Pima County Board of Supervisors and the Pima County Sheriff have "self-inflicted a public safety crisis" upon the community."We still believe some of the people released will be a public safety danger. This is purely politics, not public safety at this point," Dominguez said. "And if we have less officers at the facility, we're going to let these inmates out to the public, to our local community, to work low income communities."Picture of the Pima County Adult Detention Center. (Credit: Pima County Sheriff's Department)((Credit: Pima County Sheriff's Department))Scott told Fox News on Saturday that the number of correctional officers who are getting vaccinated is on the rise but said that if a reduction in the jail population has to be made, a number of non-violent individuals being held in jail could be released.However, Dominguez says that "it will not shock" him if he hears in January that the county administration has released an inmate that causes harm to citizens."It will not shock me to hear that the County Administration and Sheriff have let an inmate out as a result of this mandate that causes harm to our community or innocent citizens of our community. I truly feel for our innocent community members who are concerned and who this will ultimately affect," he said.Picture of the Pima County Sheriff's Department. (Credit: Pima County Sheriff's Department)((Credit: Pima County Sheriff's Department))SENATE VOTES TO REPEAL BIDEN FEDERAL VACCINE MANDATE FOR BUSINESSESHe says that county officials will say that they’re only releasing "non-violent" individuals and cited what happened in Waukesha as a lesson."Of course, they give the general political statement ‘nonviolent.’ But we saw what non-violent does in Kenosha. We saw what non-violent releases do across the country with this ‘woke’ system, it’s disgusting," Dominguez said.The sergeant also said that he's estimating 500 to 700 inmates out of the 1,700 to 1,800 that are currently detained would have to be released from the county jails if the current number of unvaccinated corrections officers are terminated.Beyond the danger to the public that Dominguez says the vaccine requirement poses, he also says that conditions within the jails will deteriorate as well, stating that there will be "potential inmate violence" and even "assaults on officers."Additionally, Dominguez says that the board of supervisors is forcing some officers to make a difficult and painful decision.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP"Nobody should have to pick between putting Christmas presents under the tree for their kids or taking a jab with this vaccine if they don't want to, because it's unconstitutional. It strictly should be personal choice. This is purely politics, not public safety at this point," Dominguez said.Chris Nanos, the sheriff of Pima County told Fox News that the county is prepared to handle the termination of correction officers."The Pima County Sheriff’s Department is well prepared to handle the dismissal of 158 correctional officers if the need arise. Such dismissal is viewed as addition by subtraction…No one is irreplaceable," Nanos said.Adam Sabes is a writer for Fox News Digital.

He views the approved vaccine requirement as a reasonable measure since it doesn't apply to every county employee."It's not a sweeping mandate, for example, within our sheriff's department, as I said, it only applies to people who work at the jail. It doesn't apply to rank and file deputies who work out in the community. Those folks may deal with vulnerable populations from time to time.

Lesher wrote in her Dec. 6 memorandum that some of these same types of crimes may be eligible for release if there is a shortage of correctional officers because of the vaccine requirement.Adam Sabes is a writer for Fox News Digital.

Here's what you need to know as you start your day …Senate votes to repeal Biden federal vaccine mandate for businessesThe Senatevoted Wednesday to repeal aPresident Biden-backed federal COVID-19 vaccine mandate for private businesses.The final vote was 52-48. Moderate Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Jon Tester of Montana joined Republicans to vote in favor of the repeal.Republicans brought the repeal to the Senate floor under the "Congressional Review Act," which allows Congress to review presidential executive orders. Sen. Mike Braun, R-Ind., who sponsored the resolution, said the mandate was an example of the "heavy hand of government" hurting businesses.The Biden administration’s mandate requires private companies with 100 or more employees to ensure their employees are vaccinated against COVID-19 or undergo regular testing. Firms that do not comply face steep fines.The mandate prompted immediate legal challenges from several states as well as business and religious groups. Last month, a federal appeals court enacted a temporary hold on enforcement of the mandate pending the outcome of litigation.Even with Senate approval, the GOP-backed resolution is unlikely to overturn the mandate. The Democrat-controlled House is not expected to take up the measure and President Biden would likely veto the bill if it cleared Congress.CLICK HERE FOR MORE ON OUR TOP STORY.In other developments:- Los Angeles school districtfireshundreds of employees who refused to get vaccine- Finland's 36-year-old prime ministerapologizesfor clubbing after COVID-19 close contact- Georgia federal judgelatestto halt Biden federal contractor vaccine mandate- GOP senators say they believe Housewill take upanti-vaccine mandate bill, force Biden veto- COVID cases top100K per daydespite US hitting 200M vaccine milestone- Omicron: Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine may onlypartially protectagainst new variant, study suggestsLos Angeles County DA blasted over 'tone deaf' news conference on crime: ‘An embarrassment’Los AngelesCounty District AttorneyGeorge Gasconwas surrounded by several colleagues from other states Wednesday while defending his policies amid a secondrecall attemptto oust him and acrimewave ofshootingsand brazen burglaries.Gascon, a former San Francisco police chief, has taken heat since taking office last year over his rollback of tough-on-crime measures like the death penalty, charging juvenile suspects as adults and the leveling of criminal enhancements, which can significantly increase prison sentences."We have set a path for ourselves and turned around the criminal legal system in the country in a way that will be more humane, more equitable and, above all, will create a safer environment for all of us," he claimed during a news conference."Before I took office, the legal system here offered victims one solution after someone causes harm: a long sentence," Gascon continued.

It was also the first time lawmakers gathered to vote since the requirement that anyone entering the statehouse complex show a negative test or proof of vaccination.Tables with officials checking documents were set up at entrances around the complex, poster boards announcing the new policy stood on easels and state troopers milled around the building as well.BIDEN REQUIREMENT FOR COVID-19 TESTING 24 HOURS BEFORE INTERNATIONAL FLIGHTS TO START MONDAYSome Republicans who flouted the rule said it was unenforceable, contending it ran afoul of the state constitution."It’s unfair and completely discriminatory policy. They’re essentially creating two classes of people, vaccinated and unvaccinated," Bergen said.But others reluctantly abided by it. GOP state Sen. Holly Schepisi offered her vaccination card to troopers."I know you’re just doing your job," she said before calling the requirement a derogatory term.Late Thursday, Judge Allison Accurso of the Appellate Division issued a short order granting the GOP’s application in a lawsuit aimed at stopping the order. The judge’s order sets a possible hearing date of Dec. 13, and while it allows the suit to go forward, it doesn’t address the underlying arguments in the case.A message seeking comment was left with the attorney general’s office, which will represent the joint legislative commission that set the requirement.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPKevin Drennan, the chair of the commission, declined through a spokesperson to comment on the suit earlier Thursday.Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy has instituted similar requirements for state workers. On Monday, he decried the GOP’s opposition to the statehouse rule as "reckless."The disagreement comes as congressional Republicans opposed to President Joe Biden’s vaccination rules in Congress are poised to stall a must-pass funding bill. The Biden administration has pursued vaccine requirements on several groups of workers, but the effort is facing one setback after another in legal cases.Get all the stories you need-to-know from the most powerful name in news delivered first thing every morning to your inboxSubscribedYou've successfully subscribed to this newsletter!This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2022 FOX News Network, LLC.

"If human nature and history teach anything, it is that civil liberties face grave risks when governments proclaim indefinite states of emergency."During a pandemic such as this one, it is even more important to safeguard the separation of powers set forth in our Constitution to avoid erosion of our liberties," he added.Noting that the case "will ultimately be decided by a higher court than this one," Doughty wrote, "However, it is important to preserve the status quo in this case.

"We'll have to face this new threat like we've faced those that have come before it."He stressed the importance of being vaccinated and said people must "understand that you have to get your vaccine, you have to get the shot, have to get the booster."CORONAVIRUS OMICRON COVERAGE: LIVE UPDATESAs the U.S. braces for the new variant, states with the highest daily rate of news cases are predominantly led by Democrats who have long embraced mandates on masking and vaccines.As of Monday, Michigan has the highest daily rate of new cases per 100,000 residents with 85, according to theNew York Times, followed by New Hampshire with 73, New Mexico with 67, and Vermont and Minnesota both with 61. All the states in the top five voted for president Biden in the 2020 election.Michigan had some of the most strict coronavirus lockdowns last yearas the virus spread across the country, which resulted in bars and restaurants being shut down across the state and eventual protests at the Capitol building in Lansing.Vermont, meanwhile, has the highest vaccination rate in the country, withnearly 72%of its residents being fully vaccinated, according to CDC data this month. And the surge in New Mexico comes after Democratic Gov.

Ron DeSantis, for example, has signedlegislation limiting vaccine mandatesfor workers in his state, has repeatedly slammed the federal government and other states' strict regulations on the coronavirus, and has dubbed the state as one of freedom.President Joe Biden speaks about the COVID-19 variant named omicron, in the Roosevelt Room of the White House on Monday.(AP/Evan Vucci)"We were here to celebrate a great city in the state of Florida, a freedom city, and it's important that when you have the federal government overreaching, like Joe Biden's doing, that we signed legislation to protect Floridians," DeSantis told Fox News earlier this month after he signed a package of anti-COVID-19 vaccine mandate bills in Brandon. "Doing it here in Brandon I think is especially meaningful because I think people here really appreciate it."Biden has swiped at DeSantis and other Republican governors who have resisted strict mandates, such as Gov.

He added that she cannot speak but breathes through her mouth, making the use of a mask dangerous to her health.But on Oct. 7 Sofia stepped off the school bus with a mask wet from her saliva, tied to her head with a thin, nylon string, Steel told Fox News last month.

Greg Murphy and Virginia Foxx of North Carolina and Burgess Owens of Utah teamed up to send a letter to House Education and Labor Democrats on Monday highlighting stronger parental involvement in children's schooling after COVID-19 and calling for subcommittee hearings to address the impact of school closures and critical race theory (CRT) teachings in schools."Many parents in our districts are attending fall parent-teacher conferences around this time and are deeply worried that their kids are falling behind in school through no fault of their own," members wrote. "The reality is that some students will be forced to repeat a grade, and many will advance to the next grade without being adequately prepared through essential in-person instruction. We must be prepared to discuss the implications of what this will mean for the next generation of students in our country."Rep. Greg Murphy, R-N.C., in Washington on Tuesday Sept. 17, 2019.

Classes have been canceled, principals are picking up mops and brooms to fill in for other positions, and some students have even stepped up to fill in vacant jobs following thecoronavirus."The reality is that these districts just don't feel they have any other options than canceling school for the day. This should serve as a wakeup call that we need to do better by our students and our public schools,"Colorado Education Association President Amie Baca-Oehlersaid last week, according to USA Today."There's an overwhelming sense of exhaustion," she added.SomeDenver area schools already switchedto temporary remote learning to cope with the shortages, and were among other schools across the U.S. that canceled classes on Friday to extend the observance of Veterans Day to a four-day weekend.The issue isn’t an isolated one.

The district attributed the influx of substitute teacher requests to the "the fatigue that educators and students are experiencing, locally and nationwide, 11 weeks into the return to in-class learning."TEACHER SHORTAGES IMPACTING SCHOOLS NATIONWIDEThe shortages of teachers have left some parents outraged, while other parents have put their foot down on canceling classes."They care about themselves more than they care about the kids," one anonymous Pennsylvania parenttold ABC 6 of teachers.San Diego Unified School District planned to give students the day off on Friday for a mental health day amid staffing shortages but backed off the plan after pushback from parents.A "closed" sign in front of a public elementary school in Grand Rapids, Michigan in March 2020.

The parents I talked to all felt like 'here we go again' with just that regular stress of trying to manage childcare," parentJen Boynton told CBS 8.Much of the shortages are attributed to fatigue following lockdowns in 2020 and teachers heading back to classrooms this year where they face issues of learning loss and mental health issues with students. The country has also seen large protests from teachers over various state and city vaccine mandates.NEW YORK TEACHERS PROTEST VACCINE MANDATES, MARCH ACROSS BROOKLYN BRIDGE: 'I CALL THE SHOTS'Data from Education Week shows 40% of district leaders and principals would call their staffing situation "severe" or"very severe" this year.While stress stemming from the coronavirus last year is contributing toabout a quarter of teachers nationwidecontemplating quitting their jobs, RAND Corp found in a survey earlier this year.Row of empty desks in front of whiteboard.

The Michigan state superintendent, for example, is suggesting investing between$300-$500 millionover the next five years to recruit and retain teachers in the state. Philadelphia substitute teachers are getting$50 daily increases in pay. And West Contra Costa County Unified in California is offering a$6,000 bonus for teachers."We need to re-invest now. We need to rebuild the teacher profession," Michigan superintendent Dr. Michael Rice said.Increasing pay for teachers is also supported by the Biden administration. First lady Jill Biden, who is a teacher, has said that "the bottom line" is getting more pay to educators, adding that it needs to "start from the top."But some are bracing for the issue to get worse."What I'm concerned is the potential for a great resignation," Maryland’s Montgomery County Education Association president Jennifer Martin toldNBC 4 on Wednesday.Montgomery County Public Schools is short 161 teachers and more than 100 paraeducators. The remaining teachers in the district are struggling to help kids with mental health issues stemming from lockdowns during the pandemic and are reporting missing lunch breaks to cover classes that don’t have teachers.As district leaders juggle filling in the gaps of empty teaching jobs, they’re also coping with custodial, food service and bus driver shortages. In Missouri, a district is hiring its ownstudents to fill maintenanceand food service positions within the school."Some of the positions have been short-staffed since last year," Northwest School District Kim Hawk, the district’s chief operating officer, told Fox 2 last week. "We just have struggled to find any help at all, and if you drive around and look at the help-wanted signs everywhere, you know the competition is stiff. So, we knew we had to come up with some other plan."EDUCATION SECRETARY: 'ALL HANDS ON DECK' TO ADDRESS SCHOOL STAFFING SHORTAGESIn Nevada,principals are vacuumingand mopping up schools amid a custodial shortage."You just go into the kitchen and start stuffing some food into the little plastic bags and hand it out to the kids," the principal of Gwendolyn Woolley Elementary School in North Las Vegas, Joseph Uy, told KUER last week."Honestly, I’m tired," he added.A bus driver shortage has also plagued schools across the country for months. In Massachusetts, the state called in theNational Guard in September to drive kids to school. A grandfather andretired pilot in Californiastarted a new career this year and became a bus driver to help with the shortage. In Tennessee, Metro Nashville Public Schools is bracing for the problem to get worse asdrivers in the area prepare to strikethis week.According to the National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children (NCMEC), many attempted abductions have happened when the child was traveling to or from school, which is also a time when children are likely to be wearing their backpacks.(iStock)The supply chain crisis that is looming over the U.S. as the holiday season picks up is even affecting schools.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.The new leader of theOklahomaNational Guardsaid none of its members will currently be required to become vaccinated for COVID-19, a step that contradicts with the Biden administration's vaccine mandate for the military.Unless federally mobilized, the Guardsmen will not have to become vaccinated for COVID-19, according to an order issued Thursday by new Adjutant General Thomas Mancino. No negative administrative or legal action will be taken against Guardsmen who refuse the COVID-19 vaccine. Oklahoma command will continue to process federal vaccine waivers in accordance with the Department of Defense policy.FILE - In this Feb. 11, 2021 file photo, Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt speaks during a news conference in Oklahoma City. Gov. Stitt is signing three anti-abortion bills into law. Stitt announced on Twitter Monday, April 26, 2021, that he'd signed bills requiring physicians who perform abortions to be certified in obstetrics, adding performing abortions to the list of unprofessional conduct by doctors and prohibiting abortions of a fetal heartbeat is detected. (AP Photo/Sue Ogrocki File)Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt recently appointed Mancino to replace Adjutant General Michael Thompson, who had lead the Oklahoma National Guard since 2017,The Oklahomanreported. By comparison, Thompson had supported vaccination for most Guardsmen, with some exceptions.WHITE HOUSE WALKS BACK BIDEN VOW TO USE NATIONAL GUARD TO UNTANGLE SUPPLY CHAIN"This policy is not anti-vaccine. I and the Governor are both vaccinated," Mancino said in a statement published on Saturday. "I encourage all our Oklahoma Guard Members to get vaccinated if they choose to do so. We want to educate and inform our Soldiers and Airmen so that they can make an informed decision regarding the DoD Vaccine Mandate."Under Title 32, Congress established a dual framework for the National Guard, Mancino explained. The states receive federal funding in return for being made available to the federal government when called to active duty by the President. Under Title 32, the Oklahoma National Guard is a state-controlled and federally-funded entity and takes orders from the Governor and his designated chain of command. When mobilized by the President, under Title 10, the Oklahoma National Guard takes all orders from the President and his designated chain of command, Mancino said."Failing to follow the Governor’s lawful orders while on Title 32 would be both illegal, unethical, and against our sworn oaths. Nothing in this order prevents anyone from taking the vaccine," Mancino said. "Also, nothing in his order eliminates the Federal Requirement. The Governor is hoping for Federal Relief from Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and in the interim has granted state relief from this requirement."Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin holds a briefing in Tbilisi on Oct. 18, 2021. (Photo by VANO SHLAMOV/AFP via Getty Images)(VANO SHLAMOV/AFP via Getty Images)The governor on Oct. 22 issued an executive order voicing opposition to President Biden’s vaccination requirement for federal contractors, as Stitt noted, "vaccines work and are effective, but they should not be mandated by any government to free citizens."Earlier this month, Stitt had also asked U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin to suspend a requirement that Oklahoma National Guard members receive the COVID-19 vaccination, noting 800 soldiers, or 10% of the guard, had not yet been vaccinated for COVID-19 or don't intend to get the inoculations."The Governor’s request is with Secretary Austin for decision, and the National Guard Bureau has indicated it will conduct a legal review of our position," Mancinosaid. "The proper venue for the resolution of these issues is the Governor’s office, Congress, and the Federal Executive branch. Not the court of public opinion in the press or on social media.""The clarified policy on COVID vaccinations for Oklahoma Army and Air National Guardsmen reflects the governor's ability to assert his command authority over the men and women of the Oklahoma National Guard while they are within the state's borders," Lt. Col. Geoff Legler, a spokesman for the guard, told The Oklahoman. "The clarification will allow our unvaccinated Guardsmen to continue to serve in Oklahoma without any negative repercussion, but it does not provide any protection should they need to attend any military school or training activity run by an active duty component or the Department of Defense."In previous guidance, which was overruled by Mancino’s order, Thompson outlined potential penalties for Guardsmen who did not get vaccinated, including an inability to mobilize or receive training at federal military installations. He did, however, note that Stitt’s order prevented the Oklahoma Military Department from requiring state employees to be vaccinated or show proof of vaccination.Stressing the vaccine’s effectiveness in preventing and reducing the severity of the virus, Thompson's guidance said, "All personnel will be given the opportunity to receive the vaccine. Uniformed members and Title 5 federal civilian employees who elect not to receive the vaccine will be counseled regarding the consequences of not being vaccinated. These consequences will depend on the individual's status.""However, freedom is always the standard in Oklahoma," Thompson wrote. "Deciding whether to be vaccinated is ultimately a personal choice that each of us must make. This personal decision regarding vaccination, like any other, will have consequences."Thompson’s resignation won’t completely take effect until Jan. 15, 2022.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP"The governor had been exploring making a change for a number of months, and (Gen.) Thompson had submitted his resignation," effective in January, Stitt’s spokesperson Carly Atchison told The Associated Press. "Once the governor selected (Gen.)

Here's what you need to know as you start your day …Pelosi slammed for attending lavish wedding maskless while California children are forced to mask upHouse SpeakerNancy Pelosi, D-Calif., is facing criticism after being spotted maskless at a lavish wedding with a large group of people while children in her state are required to wear masks in school.Pelosi officiated the wedding at San Francisco City Hall before guests, who had to show proof of vaccination, made their way to the Getty Mansion, where the celebration continued. The event was alsoattendedby California Gov. Gavin Newsom and San Francisco Mayor London Breed."Gavin Newsom, London Breed, Nancy Pelosi all in attendance, hobnobbing with the maskless hordes, at this extremely posh billionaire heiress wedding," Reason editor Liz Wolfe tweeted. "But hey, let's make sure San Francisco's kids mask up in schools.""And why were guests able to do this?" Reopen California Schools tweeted Tuesday along with a picture of Pelosi in a large group without a mask. "Maskless indoors when school dances across California are cancelled and kids must keep masks on 7 hours/day including outside at recess in many parts of CA including in SF."In October, the city of San Francisco relaxed indoor mask requirements for religious gatherings if everyone in attendance is vaccinated, but only for groups of less than 100 people.It is unclear how many guests in total were present at the wedding, but at least 60 people could be seen in the overhead photo that featured Pelosi.CLICK HERE FOR MORE ON OUR TOP STORY.In other developments:- Pelosiagreeswith comment that US military a 'larger polluter than 140 countries combined'- AOC, Pelosiripinto Republican Rep.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.A substituteteacherinNew York Cityhas been suspended for lamenting to a classroom of mostly Chinese-American fifth graders about the Chinese Communist Party, allegedly telling the group of mostly 10-year-olds that thecoronavirusmight have been developed in a Chinese lab.Substitute teacher Peshe Schiller, 70, has since been suspended by the Department of Education while its Office of Equal Opportunity investigates the incident that happening while she was filling in for an absent instructor in the "Gifted and Talented" program at P.S. 204 in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn. One parent told theNew York Daily Newsthat 24 out of the 27 students in the class are Chinese-American.Schiller, who has been a teacher for 37 years, admitted to the newspaper that she told the students that their parents left China because it’s "a Communist country and they don’t have freedom."NYC DRUG KINGPIN-TURNED-FEDERAL WITNESS KILLED IN HARLEM DRIVE-BY SHOOTING"They wanted you to have freedom," the teacher said she told the students of their parents. "Maybe they were upset that I said China is a Communist country, they took offense to that. But it is."Schiller denied that any of her remarks were racist and told the Daily News some of the students might have exaggerated because she reprimanded them for using a bathroom on the wrong floor.The teacher further explained that she and the class "were talking about how vaccines were developed and why, and this kid out of nowhere said, ‘the virus was produced by animals.’""I said everyone has their own opinion but I heard on the news that it was developed in a laboratory," Schiller recalled to the newspaper.After a school aide overheard students talking about the incident at lunch, administrators pulled Schiller from the classroom and sent in a guidance counselor to talk with the students the next day.In notes about the lesson, one of the fifth graders wrote, "Today we had a racist teacher. She said Covid-19 was made in a lab by China. She also said China had no freedom of religion. Not true obviously."Several students told their parents Schiller described Filipinos as "dirty" – something the teacher denies – and that she pulled down her mask to voice her disagreement with Mayor Bill de Blasio’s vaccine mandate. Schiller told the newspaper that was untrue and she got vaccinated for COVID-19 before the Department of Education enforced a mandate for public school teachers and other employees.Some in the class also alleged Schiller claimed all Chinese people as communists, people who visit China end up dead, and that China lacks any freedom of religion."Hateful and racist behavior has absolutely no place in our schools and this substitute was immediately suspended and removed from our classrooms following this deeply disturbing allegation," DOE spokeswoman Katie O’Hanlon said in a statement. "Schools must be safe havens and the school offered counseling and support to these students."Several parents speaking on condition of anonymity to the newspaper voiced their outrage."Why would someone who is a teacher talk to a bunch of 10-year-olds like that?" one parent said. "I feel like this is more than racist, it’s more like bullying.""It’s outrageous to bring anything political like this forward to a group of 10-year-olds," said another. "I asked myself, ‘why would she say that?’ Is it because the majority of the class is Asian?""It’s kind of alarming," a third parent remarked. "It taught me a lesson that I need to start teaching them at this young age to pay attention to these kinds of issues. That even if an adult talks like that you need to speak up. School is supposed to be a safe place and unfortunately it’s not in this case."This comes at a time when the frequency of anti-Asian incidents — from taunts to outright assaults — reported in the United States has been on the rise since the onset of the pandemic. Separately, a vaccine mandate for New York City's roughly 148,000 public school staffers took effect last month, and de Blasio, a Democrat, indicated those who would not comply would be put on unpaid leave and substitutes would be brought in.It has also long been a controversial argument that the pandemic began in a Wuhan lab, a theory supported by suspicious behavior and obfuscation from China’s government and signs the pandemic began months before previously assumed.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPLast month, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced 26 proposed members to an advisory committee aimed to steer studies into the origin of the COVID-19 pandemic and other pathogens of epidemic potential. Since then, there’s been increasing media pressure on Peter Daszak, head of the EcoHealth Alliance research organization, to testify before Congress about what he knows, as he’s the sole representative from the United States on the WHO commission in China that investigated the virus' origins earlier this year – it concluded in March the lab theory was "extremely unlikely."The House Foreign Affairs Committee’s Republican staff has also been gathering evidence showing that months before the onset of the outbreak, the Wuhan National Biosafety Lab requested bids for major renovations to air safety and waste treatment systems in research facilities that had been operational for less than 2 years. The true reason for the procurement posting is unclear.Fox News' Rich Edson, Kayla Rivas, Julia Musto and David Rutz contributed to this report.Danielle Wallace is a reporter for Fox News Digital covering politics, crime, police and more.

Their parents. God gave each one of these kids... to their parents and they speak for them. They may be wrong, they may be dumb, they may be perfect in their decisions. But it’s still their responsibility. It’s not yours. God gave it to them. Honor their wishes, either side of the fence."Nine days after that school board meeting, Horak said he was told his "views were no longer congruent with that of Lake Region Healthcare" and he was asked to either resign or be terminated."We live in America where freedoms are held close.

He also said that a comment he made during the school board meeting about monkeys being able to tie knots could have been "misconstrued" as racist."Or perhaps my termination is because I was empowering the parents," Horak said.

"This is an issue of right vs. wrong and I am so happy that so many in our community recognized this wrong and were willing to show up, both to support Dr. Horak, but to also, in a peaceful way, voice their disagreement with Lake Region Medical Group."Horak addressed the crowd, saying that three main things brought them all together."One, you’re becoming aware that your freedoms are being taken away. Two, professionals such as myself are being silenced, and then so are you. If it happens to me, it can happen to all of us," Horak told the crowd. "And third, you’re afraid. We’re all afraid.

He also feels that  safety precautions on the job provide an added layer of protection."The PPE we’ve all worn the past twenty months is highly effective, so I just don’t see any good reason for it.

There is no option to undergo weekly COVID-19 testing.The PBA said the mandate violates its members' right to make their own medical decisions."The Vaccine Mandate will impose irreparable harm on police officers. A police officer with sincerely held medical, health, or religious concerns with the vaccine will face irreparable harm if forced to submit to vaccination prior to the Court’s determination whether a the Vaccine Mandate is unlawful," the lawsuit states. "These officers have rights to medical autonomy and religious observance that would be violated by forcing them to submit to a vaccination.

Nearly 12 million doses have been administered citywide, he said. Fox News has reached out to his office.In a letter to members on Monday, the PBA said NYPD leaders have not given specifics on the implementation of the mandate."The universal response has been that they are waiting to hear from City Hall," the letter said. "Once again, it is clear that the NYPD is being run directly by Mayor de Blasio and his advisors, who care more about politics than public health or public safety.""NYPD members are frustrated because we are trying to make important, possibly life-changing decisions while our leaders keep us in the dark – perhaps intentionally," the union added.Other unions have sued the city over the vaccine mandate.

Tina Polsky, asking visitors at the building to be respectful with social interactions. Polsky, who represents parts of Broward and Palm Beach counties, had not yet made public her breast cancer diagnosis.Polsky told The Associated Press about the tense exchange with state Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo that was first reported by the news site Florida Politics. She said Ladapo and two aides were offered masks and asked to wear them when they arrived for the Wednesday meeting. She did not tell him she had breast cancer but said she had a serious condition.Newly appointed state Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo speaks during a press conference at Neo City Academy in Kissimmee, Florida. A day after being appointed, Ladapo instituted his first rule giving parents "sole discretion" over whether their child wears a mask at school, and also allowing students who come in contact with the coronavirus to continue attending class if they remain asymptomatic.(Paul Hennessy/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)FAUCI SHOULD BE FIRED AFTER NIH ADMITS FUNDING GAIN-OF-FUNCTION RESEARCH, RAND PAUL SAYSThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says cancer patients are at a higher risk to get severely ill from COVID-19 and may not build the same immunity tovaccines.Ladapo had asked to meet her in Tallahassee as he seeks confirmation in the Senate after being named to the post by Gov.Ron DeSantislast month."It was so shocking to me that he treated me in this manner," Polsky said. "If he is a surgeon general for the next several years, I am really concerned about a future public health emergency and not being able to rely on him for necessary guidance and proper scientific leadership."Ladapo offered to go outside, but the senator said she did not want to sit on the metal picnic tables on a warm day when her office was nice and spacious. She said she asked whether there was a reason why he couldn't wear a mask, but he wouldn't answer.Democrats have opposed the appointment of Ladapo, criticizing him for comments and actions related to the pandemic.A day into his job, Ladapo signed new rules allowing parents to decide whether their children should quarantine or stay in school after being exposed to people who tested positive for COVID-19.On Thursday at a press conference with DeSantis to oppose vaccine mandates, Ladaposaidpeople were not comfortable with the vaccines because the federal government has not been open about the effectiveness and safety of the vaccines, saying there was a "concerted effort" to hide stories of people with adverse reactions.Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine has received the full approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, meeting high standards required for the vaccine to be considered safe. It has been administered to millions and proven to be effective against hospitalization and death. However, immunity against infection can wane over time.Authorities in Sweden, Denmark and Norway earlier this monthsuspendedor discouraged the use of Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine in young people because of an increased risk of heart inflammation, a very rare side effect associated with the shot.Rep. Tina Polsky, D-Boca Raton, debates during a session in March 2020 in Tallahassee, Florida. Recently, Florida's top health official was asked to leave a meeting after refusing to wear a mask at the office of the state senator who told him she had a serious medical condition, officials have confirmed.(AP Photo/Steve Cannon)Ladapo also wrote an opinion column in the Wall Street Journal saying masks have "little or no effect on respiratory virus transmission."The CDC still recommends people with weakened immune systems and those in high-transmission areas to wear masks. Studies have supported their use, with some finding that cloth masks are less effective.In the memo sent by Simpson, the president of the Florida senate, he said that while there's no mask mandate in the Senate, senators can request social distancing and masking within their offices."It shouldn't take a cancer diagnosis for people to respect each other's level of comfort with social interactions during a pandemic," he said. "What occurred in Senator Polsky's office was unprofessional and will not be tolerated in the Senate."CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThe Florida Department of Health’s spokeswoman Weesam Khoury said the agency was not aware of any specific Senate protocol but said it would ask members ahead of time and make necessary accommodations, such as meeting through Zoom or outdoors.The Department of Health "will be addressing this directly with members of the Senate, rather than letting this play out publicly," Khoury said in an email.Get all the stories you need-to-know from the most powerful name in news delivered first thing every morning to your inboxSubscribedYou've successfully subscribed to this newsletter!This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2022 FOX News Network, LLC.

SAPHIER: CHILDREN HAVE BEEN ENOUGH BY LOCKDOWNS. THINK TWICE BEFORE MANDATING A VACCINE FOR KIDSChevalier is among a small but significant number of American workers deciding whether to quit their jobs and careers in defiance of what they consider intrusive edicts that affect their freedoms.The Biden administration,public health officialsand many business leaders agree that vaccine requirements are legal, prudent actions necessary to help the world emerge from a pandemic that has killed more than 700,000 Americans and nearly 5 million people worldwide.The defiant workers make up a small fraction of the overall workforce, with many cities, states and businesses reporting that more than 9 out of 10 of their workers are complying with mandates.But they have the potential to create disruptions in a tight labor market and have become the latest roadblock in overcoming the vaccine hesitancy that allowed the COVID-19 crisis to take a devastating turn over the summer. In many cases, the reasons for the objections are rooted in misinformation.INGRAHAM: BIDEN DOESN'T UNDERSTAND CHERISHED FREEDOMSThe refusers come from all types of occupations — defense industry workers, police officers, firefighters, educators and health care workers. InSeattle, a group of city firefighters turned in their boots at City Hall on Tuesday to protest a vaccination requirement.Thousands of people have sought religious or medical exemptions that were rejected; others won’t stand to be told what to do and have quit or been fired.Nick Rolovich, the football coach atWashington State University, was let go from his $3.2 million-a-year job on Monday, along with four assistants. Rolovich, the first major college coach to lose his job over vaccination status, claimed a religious exemption but has declined to elaborate. He is suing.The conflict over mandates is likely to grow in the coming weeks. The Biden administration is expected to move forward any day with the mandate that employers with 100 or more workersrequire all employees be vaccinated or undergo weekly testing, though enforcement likely won't start for several weeks. The rule for federal contractors goes into effect in December, with no testing option, but many businesses, governments and schools are already implementing mandates.TheU.S. Chamber of Commerceand other groups that represent large employers have warned workers might simply migrate to jobs at smaller businesses where they don't face vaccination requirements. That could create challenges for large retailers going into the holiday season, among other disruptions, the chamber warned.Alec Young, a shipfitter at Bath Iron Works, center, demonstrates against COVID-19 vaccine mandates outside the shipyard on Friday, Oct. 22, 2021, in Bath, Maine. (AP Photo/Josh Reynolds)(AP Photo/Josh Reynolds)CDC MASK GUIDELINES UNDER REVIEW AS COVID NUMBERS FALL, COLD SEASON BEGINSIndividuals who've left their jobs and are seeking work that doesn’t require vaccinations are sharing information on social media. Small employers looking for workers are turning to online job boards such as RedBalloon, where employers sign a pledge that they won't make vaccines a condition for hiring.Andrew Crapuchettes, RedBalloon’s founder and chief executive, said he started the online job board more than two months ago for people "who just want to work and don’t want to get into politics in the office." More than 800 companies have posted, and more than 250,000 people have visited the site, he said.Some states, including Texas, Montana and Florida, are gearing up to fight or undercut the Biden mandates. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott issued an executive order Monday barring any entity from requiring vaccines.Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said Thursday he will call a special session to pass legislation to combat vaccine mandates, saying that, "in Florida, your right to earn a living is not contingent upon whatever choices you’re making in terms of these injections."Melissa Alfieri-Collins, a 44-year-old mother of two, said she resigned from her job as a nurse at Jersey Shore Medical Center in Neptune, New Jersey, rather than undergo regular COVID-19 testing.She said the hospital recognized her request for a medical exemption, but she objected to the requirement that only unvaccinated people get tested, arguing that even vaccinated people can spread disease.Justin Paetow, center, a tin shop worker at Bath Iron Works, takes part in a demonstration against COVID-19 vaccine mandate outside the shipyard on Friday, Oct. 22, 2021, in Bath, Maine.

Polenski said they are often leaving previous employers because of a vaccine mandate."They don’t want their vaccination status attached to their employment," he said.At the shipyard in Maine, frustration is rising among union members.On Friday, some 100 shipbuilders gathered outside the shipyard during their lunch break to protest being forced to get vaccinated. They marched down the street, holding signs decrying the mandate and using choice four-letter words that made clear what they think of the president and his vaccine mandates.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThe union fears it could lose more than 1,000 workers, or 30% of its membership, over the federal contractor mandate.Dean Grazioso, a 33-year Bath Iron Works employee, said he's not anti-vaccine but that he knows vaccinated coworkers, friends and family members who’ve contracted breakthrough COVID-19 infections. Such infections are rare and vaccinated people who get COVID-19 usually have mild symptoms and are far less likely to be hospitalized or die.The 53-year-old is still deciding whether to get the shot."I’m still up in the air," he said.

He said the department needed to talk to hundreds of officers who had thus far not provided the information.DESANTIS TWEETS ‘DONT TREAD ON FLORIDA’ FLAG AFTER CALLING FOR SPECIAL SESSION TO BAN JAB MANDATESMette encouraged those officers to stay their ground and blasted city leaders for not meeting at the bargaining table."If we fail to make them bargain with us on this issue, what issue is next?"

Lutali recently found out her hospital wouldn't approve her kidney transplant surgery until she got a COVID-19 vaccine. She has stage 5 kidney disease that puts her at risk of dying without a new kidney.(AP Photo/Thomas Peipert)Colorado health system UCHealth explained that transplant patients who contract COVID-19 have a 20 to 30% mortality rate."This shows the extreme risk that COVID-19 poses to transplant recipients after their surgeries," UCHealth told Fox News in a statement.UCHealth said patients who have undergone an organ transplant procedure require a lifetime of specialized management to ensure the organ is not rejected, which, in extreme cases, can lead to death.LOS ANGELES MAYOR TO CITY EMPLOYEES: BE PREPARED TO LOSE YOUR JOB IF YOU AREN'T VACCINATED BY DEADLINE"Physicians must consider the short- and long-term health risks for patients as they consider whether to recommend an organ transplant," UCHealth said.It noted that other transplant hospitals have been putting similar policies in place.Now, many Texans – including the governor himself – are saying those denied transplants will be welcome in the Lone Star state.FILE: A health care worker fills a syringe with the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine at Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami.(AP Photo/Lynne Sladky, Fil)"Here in Texas, vaccines remain voluntary and never forced," Texas Gov.

"But I'm to that point where it's time to stand up and take our school district back."In two weeks, asDouglas Countyresidents head to the polls, three other candidates will join Williams on the Kids First slate: Mike Peterson, Becky Myers and Kaylee Winegar. Together, they seek to defeat the teacher federation-backed CommUnity Matters slate, which includes incumbent board members Krista Holtzmann and Kevin Leung and newcomers Ruby Martinez and Juli Watkins.IN DENVER SUBURBS, PARENTS GRAPPLE WITH EQUITY PLATFORM, SCHOOL BOARD POLITICSLike Williams, Winegar never imagined she would run for an elected position."Stepping forward and being a candidate and putting myself out there for an elected position is not something I ever thought I would do, but I had a lot of encouragement from friends, I did a lot of prayer," Winegar, an accountant, told Fox News."It just felt like something that if I didn't step forward, then who would, who would represent me up on the board if it's not me?" she continued.Peterson, a leadership consultant, told Fox News he chose to run because he felt a duty to help future students."I've never run for elective office, I didn't want to run for elective office," Peterson said. "I felt a calling because I think we need to get these rising generations of kids back on track, understanding that there absolutely is privilege in America and it’s the privilege to be an American."The Kids First slate told Fox News they want to keep politics out of the classroom and unite the community, something they say the sitting board has failed to do."This board, whether they intend to or not, is putting in incredibly divisive policies," Peterson said. "They are putting parents against parents, parents against teachers."Winegar told Fox News: "I want to make sure when [my daughter] goes to school, she's having her teachers focus on the basics of academics – math, reading, writing, science, history – and that's not getting distracted with adult ideologies and personal politics in the classroom."The school board for Douglas County, aDenversuburb, unanimously passed an equity policy in March, which the district said "will ensure every DCSD student and staff member has access to equitable and rigorous educational opportunities" and aims to correct any inequities in the school district.Though parents expressed concern to Fox News that the equity policy could open up the district to the teachings of critical race theory, the district stated on its website that critical race theory is not part of its curriculum.Peterson and Williams also told Fox News that the district’sCOVID-19protocols factored into their decision to run."I was one of those COVID candidates," Peterson said. "I started listening to board meetings, speaking at board meetings, attended board meetings, and I found that what I thought was going to school did not reflect my values or many of the values of those around us."Williams said seeing her kids in school full-time while other kids were left to learn remotely drove her to run."Really what pushed me over the edge was watching the COVID response," said Williams, who’s owned a small dog training business for over 15 years."My kids were in school five days a week in person last year, and my neighbor's kids weren't," she continued. "They were outside riding their bikes, while my kids were getting a full day education and it broke my heart to see other kids not receiving the same opportunity as my child, my children."The Douglas County School District announced a district-wide mask mandate before the school year began. Despite opposition, the district said its hands were tied because the order originated from the local health department, which had jurisdiction over the school district.Douglas County last month voted to leave the health department it shared with two neighboring counties in favor of starting its own agency. The new department rescinded the county-wide mask mandate.But Douglas County School District superintendent Corey Wise told parents in early October that the mandate would remain in effect for the school district.The newly formed Douglas County Health Department on Oct. 8 took the mandate reversal a step further and approved a policy that allowed parents to exempt their children from mask mandates, including those required by schools.The Douglas County School District subsequently issued guidance on its website stating that it would comply with the order."To clarify, DCSD procedures for masking in schools remain in place with the exception of a new avenue for families to exempt their children from mask-wearing, if desired," the guidance states.To mend the division over the last year around COVID-19 and the equity policy, Williams said her first goal as a board member would be to bring people together."I think the first priority would have to be just building trust with our teachers, with the community, just really bringing people back together," she told Fox News. "There's been so much pitting against each other and it's not good."CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPPeterson said he hopes Douglas County can refocus oneducational performance, something he believes should unite parents."The thing that Douglas County needs most is a return to focusing on the key aspects of recovery, growth and achievement in education, and that's something all political sides can agree upon," he told Fox News.Fox News extended interview requests to all eight candidates. A representative for Beth Myers told Fox News she was out of town on previously scheduled travel.

The mayor added that about two dozen employees had yet to submit paperwork that either declared their intent to vaccinate or requested an exemption to the rule.istock(iStock)"We’re in much better shape than we thought we would be because so many people have done exactly what we asked them to do," Durkan said.But Seattle has already faced an issue of declining numbers in its police force, leading some to question the wisdom of sending officers packing due to the mandate."Sadly, this mandate will remove over 100 officers as it stands, and that’s unacceptable," said the Seattle Police Officers Guild's Mike Solan.The guild argued that emergency response times will suffer due to the sudden shortage of officers, adding that the number of employees who will be forced out is larger than the official city tally.Seattle Fire Department Chief Harold Scoggins said that while it will hurt the department to lose good employees, he's confident that his firefighters will still be able to meet the needs of residents.(Seattle Police Department / Facebook)CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP"We may lose some folks, but we’re confident we’re going to get a unit out the door to respond," Scoggins said.Michael Lee is a writer at Fox News.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.The individual names andvaccinationstatuses of some 40,000Oregonstate employees were mistakenly released to two newspapers, which a labor union is saying breaches an agreement reached with the state last month assuring that the private medical information would remain confidential, according to a report.The privacy breach reportedly happened Monday, the same day as Gov. Kate Brown’s COVID-19 vaccine mandate deadline for all state employees. Since the governor issued the order in August,The Oregonian/Oregon Livehas requested daily information from Brown’s administration on vaccination rates and vaccine exemption rates for each executive branch agency the governor oversees.But Oregon Department of Administrative Services External Relations Director Adam Crawford reportedly emailed a file to The Oregonian/OregonLive and the Salem Statesman Journal with a spreadsheet listing the name of each executive branch employee and their vaccination status.PORTLAND SETS NEW HOMICIDE RECORD, USES TRAFFIC BARRELS TO COMBAT DRIVE-BY SHOOTINGSCrawford later told The Oregonian sending that information was a "mistake." Neither Brown’s office, Crawford, not others at the Oregon Department of Administrative Services have returned a Fox News Digital request for comment Tuesday.The Oregonian/OregonLive said it was making the editorial decision not to publish the names and vaccination statuses of the individual employees provided to them in the spreadsheet.SEUI 503, a 72,000-member union representing employees at 85 different state, local government and non-profit agencies and care facilities, said the release of the information Monday violates an agreement reached with the state in September requiring vaccination information be kept confidential."[What’s] more concerning is that one of the main things that we heard from members who were vaccine hesitant is they were concerned about their privacy in this situation," SEUI 503 spokesman Ben Morris told The Oregonian. "This is a breach of trust at the worst possible time."The union is still weighing what action to take. Under the agreement reached in September, state employees were required to receive at least one dose of the vaccine against COVID-19 or submit a written request for exception by Oct. 18 to "avoid personnel action." Employees who had begun, but not completed the vaccination process by Monday have until November 30, 2021 to become fully vaccinated. Per the agreement, employees will be expected to work remotely between Oct. 18 and the point of full vaccination status.According to the latest data set, Oregon State Police and the Department of Corrections have both approved religious exemption requests at a higher rate compared to other Oregon state agencies. Just 74% of Oregon State Police have confirmed vaccination status, and 70% of Department of Corrections employees have confirmed they are vaccinated for COVID-19.News of the release comes after a federal judge on Monday denied a last-minute bid by more than three dozen state employees, health care providers and school staff to temporarily stop the state’s COVID-19 vaccine mandate. U.S. District Judge Michael H. Simon rejected their motion for a temporary restraining order, marking the first federal judge’s ruling after several state court decisions thwarting similar efforts to block Gov. Brown’s and the Oregon Health Authority’s power to require that certain workers to get thevaccinesor risk losing their jobs.At least 10 vaccine mandate challenges have been filed in state and federal court since September. Among the 42 plaintiffs are nurses, doctors, teachers and school athletic coaches, including a LifeFlight paramedic, a hospice nurse, dental hygienist and pharmacist.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP"In the middle of a global pandemic while infections and hospitalizations continue at high rates, Plaintiffs are not likely to succeed in showing that their individual interests in remaining unvaccinated outweigh the State’s interest in public health and welfare," the judge wrote in a 55-page opinion.The judge found the plaintiffs failed to show they will be irreparably harmed by the vaccine mandate. While he said some state employees may face firing for failure to be vaccinated, he added that "it’s still only money," and they can get their job back or pay reinstated if they prevail in the case at a later point.The Associated Press contributed to this report.Danielle Wallace is a reporter for Fox News Digital covering politics, crime, police and more.

"I don’t think the city of Seattle is looking far enough forward. I think what they’re trying to do is bully these police officers into saying you need to get vaccinated or we’ll fire you. If I was a citizen, I’d be irate not just because we’re going to have less police officers now but also because of the money that’s going to be wasted on this litigation."SEATTLE BUSINESS OWNER FEARS VACCINE MANDATE WILL LENGTHEN 911 RESPONSE TIME: ‘I CAN’T GET HELP'"Police officers need to be able to make their own health decisions," Smith said. "When you become a police officer, we know we’re giving up a lot of control - I’m told when I work, where I work, what I wear, what I can say. This is just one more layer of control put on these officers that is unnecessary.""Right now, coronavirus is the number one killer of on-duty police officers," Smith said. "It’s the number one line-of-duty death for American law enforcement. So it’s not lost on us that this is a very dangerous disease for us. But we, American law enforcement, have already been out there in the pandemic since the get-go. So we know how dangerous it is. And we need to be able to make choices. An unvaccinated law enforcement officer is not endangering anyone except for themselves."Several Seattle police patrol cars were photographed with Gadsden flags hanging from their windows Monday in protest of the mandate, spreading the message "Don’t Tread On Me." Meanwhile, a Washington State Patrol officer filmed himself Friday saying it was his last shift on the force after refusing the vaccine, adding a strongly worded message to Washington Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee. Smith questioned what the desired end game was for Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan and City Council, as Washington’s largest city has been plagued by "out of control violent crime.""In the Seattle Police Department, no one has been more wrongfully vilified than those police officers," Smith said. "You can go back to CHOP/CHAZ and move forward. This is just one more thing that this administration lead by Mayor Jenny is already putting on these beleaguered officers. I know for a fact that a lot of Seattle police officers are seeking other employment whether it’s outside of law enforcement or it’s within the profession in another area."Seattle Police officers confer after taking part in a public roll call at Hing Hay Park in Seattle's Chinatown-International District Thursday, March 18, 2021. Seattle's police department is having detectives and non-patrol staff respond to emergency calls because of a shortage of officers union leaders fear will be made worse by COVID-19 vaccine mandates.((AP Photo/Ted S. Warren, File))Last summer, "defund police" protesters violently seized an abandoned police precinct and about six city blocks in downtown Seattle, creating an autonomous zone, which Durkan herself visited. City crews eventually dismantled makeshift barriers after shootings in the CHOP/CHAZ zone turned deadly. In the initial months after George Floyd’s death, Smith claims the mayor dumped the most diverse recruit class that the Seattle Police Department had ever seated. Durkan is not seeking re-election but both mayoral candidates said they support a vaccine mandate for police officers."The voters of Seattle must decide they want to change the direction the city is going," Smith said.  "It’s just a filthy, sad city. And the Seattle Police Department is trying to change that.""I think what’s going to happen is more and more Seattle police officers will try to leave," she continued. "Those who have to stay because they’re at the end of their careers and they want to get their pension or they don’t want to move out of Washington state, are going to avoid activities that might get them in trouble with their administration. So they’re not going to be as aggressive in the prevention of crime. They’ll just become responders and report takers because the mayor has worked very hard to demoralize them and I don’t think her predecessors are going to be much different."Solan previously said officers won’t face immediate termination Monday. Those who choose not to get vaccinated against COVID-19 will receive notice for a "Loudermill hearing," or a public forum where an employee can present their reasoning for going against the mandate before formal separation.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThe union representing some 1,000 Seattle police personnel suggests that the COVID-19 vaccine mandate could worsen staffing shortages, which in turn could risk public safety. As of last Wednesday, the Seattle Police Department activated its emergency three-stage mobilization plan, which involves sending detectives and non-patrol officers to emergency calls because of a shortage of patrol officers."Crime is surging in this city. Our community is demanding more police officers to answer the 911 calls, and the fact we've already lost close to 350 police officers because of the politicians' political betrayal," Solan told KING. People believe in personal choice, and we as a union have to represent everybody. We’re not going to play the games of segregating between the vaxxed and the unvaxxed, It’s not about that. This is about saving jobs."Danielle Wallace is a reporter for Fox News Digital covering politics, crime, police and more.

Vaccination is particularly important in these patients for their safety.  Living donation for organ transplantation has been a life-saving treatment, but it is not without risks to the donor.  For the living donor, reducing the risk of a COVID-19 infection around the time of their surgery and recovery is crucial," the statement continued."For the transplant candidate, in addition to a major operation, medications taken after an organ transplant weaken a person’s immune response. Serious complications of COVID-19 are most likely to develop in those individuals who have weakened immune systems, as their body has a reduced ability to fight and recover from infections. The FDA-authorized vaccines have been determined to be safe and effective and are the best way to prevent severe illness and death from COVID-19."The Cleveland Clinic also noted that no one on the waiting list for an organ transplant has been removed due to not being vaccinated, and that "the vaccination is to prevent severe illness or death from COVID-19."CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPA similar story recently unfolded in Colorado, where a woman with stage 5 renal failure was denied a kidney transplant due to her and her donor being unvaccinated.Get all the stories you need-to-know from the most powerful name in news delivered first thing every morning to your inboxSubscribedYou've successfully subscribed to this newsletter!This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2022 FOX News Network, LLC.

" … I said ‘okay’ and she kind of got closer to me and said like, ‘Do you really find this funny? This isn’t funny at all,’ and was kind of going off. So I turned around and stood right next to her and said like, ‘No, I don’t find this funny at all, but I’m not going to wear a mask.'"Dawson’s brother Ethan, a 15-year-old student at the school, told Rantz that he was also separated from his class and moved to the portable because he refused to wear a mask.While there appeared to be strict COVID-19 rules inside the classroom, both students said that there appeared to be no rules inside the small portable, where a masked staff member was present.They shared photos with Rantz showing the portable had no dividers between maskless students and no social distancing. Dawson and Ethan said six other students were with them on the first day of school, and only one other the following day.The students’ parents told Rantz that they both will be enrolled in remote learning due to the mask policy.The mother of another student sent to the portable told Rantz that these students weren’t being taught anything while removed from their class. When she contacted District Superintendent Shaun Carey, she said that he told her if the student is unwilling to comply with the rules, he could go to another district.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPA spokesperson for the school district confirmed the policy to Rantz, saying it was "a temporary protocol" for the start of school to address those who refused to wear face coverings."The purpose of the protocol was to maintain the health and safety of the EHS learning community, to adhere to the mandate provided by the state of WA and was not a disciplinary action," the spokesperson said.

The ruling came two days earlier from when the panel was expected to hold a hearing on the issue.The court issued a temporary injunction on the mandate last week.De Blasio said the vaccine requirement goes into effect on Oct. 4. Originally, all teachers and school employees were supposed to be partially vaccinated by Monday."Vaccinations are our strongest tool in the fight against COVID-19 – this ruling is on the right side of the law and will protect our students and staff," the city's Department of Education said in a statement.The mayor said around 87% of Department of Education employees have already received at least one dose, including 90% of teachers and 97% of principals."The city’s estimate is that 97% of the teachers have been vaccinated, but according to our recent survey of UFT chapter leaders, only about one-third believe that as of now their schools can open without disruption, given the potential shortage of unvaccinated personnel, including school aides and security personnel," said Michael Mulgrew, president of the United Federation of Teachers."The city has a lot of work before it to ensure that enough vaccinated staff will be available by the new deadline," he added. "We will be working with our members to ensure, as far as possible, that our schools can open safely as the vaccine mandate is enforced."CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThe mandate has prompted concerns from some who fear it could result in a shortage of teachers and substitutes."For parents and kids, this should be a real sense of relief to see the numbers are already so high," de Blasio said. "And that says great things about our ability to have a safe school system and keep everything moving."Louis Gelormino, an attorney for the UFT, told Fox News he was prepared to take the case to the Supreme Court."How can laying off or suspending 28,000, and that's not an exaggerated number, DOE employees not have an effect on the New York City schools, which don't run very efficiently in the best of times," he said. "We're reviewing our options and there's a good possibility that we might try to take it up to the Supreme Court.".Louis Casiano is a reporter for Fox News Digital.

For those still making up their minds, force is not the answer. The schools should implement weekly testing if they truly want to keep everyone safe," he added."This case has already led to progress in protecting the rights of our members, since the city — in the wake of the court’s initial issuance of the restraining order — admitted that there can be exceptions to the vaccine mandate," said Municipal Labor Committee Chair Harry Nespoli.

Holliday was not vaccinated and was on a ventilator in recent days after contracting pneumonia, Wollenweber said.Holliday was awakened by a traffic stop outside his San Fernando Valley home on the night of March 3, 1991. He went outside to film it with his new video camera, catching the Los Angeles officers punching, kicking and using a stun gun on King, even after he was on the ground.RODNEY KING TRIAL: A LOOK BACK AT THE RACIALLY CHARGED HIGH-PROFILE CASEA year later, Holliday’s out-of-focus footage — about 9 minutes worth — was a key piece of evidence at the four officers’ criminal trial for assault and excessive use of force.When a jury acquitted all the officers on April 29, 1992, the city erupted in widespread violence. Hundreds of businesses were looted and destroyed over several days. Entire blocks of homes and stores went up in flames. More than 60 people died by shootings or other violence, mostly in South Los Angeles.George Holliday, the Los Angeles plumber who shot grainy video of four white police officers beating Black motorist Rodney King in 1991, has died of complications of COVID-19, a friend said Monday.

King drowned in his backyard swimming pool on June 17, 2012, at age 47.Holliday’s death was first reported byTMZ.com.Holliday put the Sony camcorder he used to record the beating up for auction last July, with bidding starting at $225,000.

Our focus right now is caring for our employee and the rest of our restaurant family. We are a family-style restaurant, and this is the absolute last experience any of our employees should ever endure and any customers witness."The incident comes after New York Mayor Bill de Blasio announced that people who want to dine indoors in the city’s restaurants will need to show proof of vaccination.Banks said that Carmine’s had trained staff ahead of the vaccine passport requirement, but never expected such a situation to unfold and will now hire more security at the front door.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP"We ID for 21-year-olds all the time at the bar," he said.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.A doctor inCanadais going viral after posting a video message saying it’s "atrocious" that some healthcare professionals would limit care for patients who aren’tvaccinated."I hate it, I think it's wrong. I think it's creating mistrust. I think it's divisive. I think it's creating more tribalism and it, to me, is the last thing we need," Dr. Kwadwo Kyeremanteng said in a video posted to his Twitter on Wednesday that has been viewed nearly 150,000 times.Kyeremanteng is a critical care and palliative care physician at The Ottawa Hospital, who also frequently discusses healthcare on podcasts and other platforms.TWO AMERICAN TRAVELERS TO CANADA FINED $16,000 EACH FOR FAKE VACCINATION DOCUMENTSHe continued on Twitter that he wants all of his patients to get the vaccine, but noted that "this talk of limiting care for the unvaxxed is wrong.""For us to put value judgments on people based on lifestyle decisions, choosing not to get vaccinated ... I want you to be vaccinated, but I also don't want you to smoke. I also don't want you to use IV drug use, and despite that, when you come into my ICU, I treat you the same," he said, telling Fox News that he posted the video after seeing negative chatter on social media about the unvaccinated and potentially taxing them and limiting their care."We hustle, we do what we can to serve and get you through your illness. And to think that we would do anything less because of your vaccine status is atrocious, it is absolutely atrocious. And it would be extremely shameful to even think that's a consideration within our society."Kyeremanteng told Fox News on Thursday that having honest conversations with people and not "shaming them" can lead to informed decisions on the safety of the vaccines, and that now is the time "to be nice.""The whole kind of shaming approach is, that's never been an effective way. We need to be compassionate, we need to listen to what the concerns are," he said, and noted that messaging on the vaccine needs to "be more clear and focused."His video comes after vaccine mandates in both Canada and the United States have increased in recent weeks.In Canada, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in August that people would be banned fromboarding any plane, train or cruise ship unless they are fully vaccinated. All government employees are also required to get the vaccine, along with airlines and railways employees.FURIOUS CROWD FORCES JUSTIN TRUDEAU TO CANCEL CAMPAIGN EVENT: 'NEED FREEDOM'While in the United States, President Biden announced a vaccine mandate for all businesses that employ more than 100 people or submit to weekly testing.

More than 60% is fully vaccinated."I agree with the mandate," said one woman. "I think in order to get back to anywhere near normal we need a vaccine mandate in place, and I think to keep other people safe it's really important to get vaccinated.""It's going against everybody's will," a man exclaimed.LIBERAL MEDIA EMBRACES BIDEN'S COVID POWER GRAB AFTER REJECTING TRUMP'S THREAT TO OVERRIDE GOVERNORS LAST YEARThe rule will likely affect millions of workers and will also levy substantial fines, up to $14,000 per infraction, against companies that refuse to comply.Another man took it a step further and asserted that Biden’s mandates even fell short, adding that a nation is "responsible to get people vaccinated" because people who are not vaccinated pose a "public risk and a threat to every other person." He later said he wasn’t angry with the unvaccinated like Biden appeared to be in his Sept. 9 speech—he just thought they were idiots.The man added people who are not vaccinated should be "compelled" to do so and voiced his approval for more stringent mandates.Another man disagreed with Biden’s mandate, saying that the rule should only apply to businesses that take federal funds.Another woman felt Biden’s requirement for 100 and up employee businesses was a good idea because of the "influx" of COVID cases occurring."You gotta follow the law, I guess," she added.New York City is seeing its borough-level vaccination mandates nearly coinciding with Biden’s announcement on the federal level.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPMayor Bill de Blasio said back in July that he was requiringall New York City employeesto be vaccinated or tested once per week for COVID-19 by Sept. 13.Some restaurants and businesses began enforcing vaccination identification check back in August, with the number steadily growing.Nikolas Lanum is an associate editor for Fox News Digital.Get all the stories you need-to-know from the most powerful name in news delivered first thing every morning to your inboxSubscribedYou've successfully subscribed to this newsletter!This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2022 FOX News Network, LLC.

The requirement impacts federal employees as well as large employers, among other sectors.Larry Cosme, president of the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association (FLEOA), called the mandate a "misguided" attempt that undermines vaccination efforts.BIDEN VACCINE MANDATE MARKS ANOTHER WHITE HOUSE FLIP-FLOP"The COVID-19 pandemic is a rapidly evolving and emotional trying situation. In the face of so many uncertainties, our federal government should trust its employees to make their own medical decision under consultation with their doctor, not mandate by their employer," Cosme said in a statement. "Vaccination should be promoted through education and encouragement – not coercion."He added that the mandate inserts the federal government into personal medical decisions.In his speech, Biden took issue with those hesitant or flat out against getting vaccinated."We've been patient but our patience is wearing thin and your refusal has cost all of us," he said. "This is not about freedom or personal choice. It's about protecting yourself and those around you."He also called on state governors to mandate coronavirus vaccines for teachers and school staff, while seeming to call out FloridaRepublicanGov.Ron DeSantis, who has threatened to withhold pay for school leaders who defy his ban on mask mandates."If these governors won’t help us beat the pandemic, I’ll use my power as president to get them out of the way," Biden said.The back of a Homeland Security officers vest late in the day in Lower Manhattan as a man passes late in the day.

Some states like Alabama, Georgia, Florida, and North Carolina are putting mobile morgues on standby.ALBANY, Ga. – As the number ofcoronaviruscases rise across the country, states are working to prepare for another wave of the pandemic — and another wave of COVID-related deaths — and they are bringing in mobile morgues to help.When the pandemic first hit in 2019, hospitals were forced to bring in mobile morgues to help store bodies.Morgues have to be able to support COVID-related deaths and everything else including homicides and drug deaths. States including Alabama, Florida and North Carolina now have mobile morgues on standby.NEARLY ALL COVID-19 DEATHS IN US ARE NOW AMONG UNVACCINATEDAlbany County, Georgia, coroner Michael Fowler says they are planning before another storm of the virus arrives."It hit our community, I always say, like a wildfire. It just went through our community. You can get up on higher ground for a flood, get into shelter for a tornado but for a pandemic that you cannot see, it was different for the community," Fowler said.Mobile morgue in 2020Like many places across the country southeast Georgia became a hotspot and there wasn’t enough room for the influx of COVID-related deaths."We were stacking bodies, I put it that way I hate to say it – but we had nowhere to put them. That’s why we had to get the mobile morgue because we don’t want to stack bodies," Fowler saidNEARLY ALL COVID-19 DEATHS IN US ARE NOW AMONG UNVACCINATEDThe coroner said bodies need to be stored because it takes time to test for the virus and find the cause of death. "Many time — especially if they died in the residence — you have to put them in a morgue until the department of public health can come by and do a test," Fowler said.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 600,000 Americans have died from the coronavirus and hospitalizations continue to rise.Eddie Cobb, owner of Promise Land Funeral home in southeast Georgia, is seeing more people die of COVID."It’s very sad moment when someone passes from COVID. Someone dies basically from a handshake or entering a room with someone that possibly has COVID, that’s a very hard time," Cobb said.Morgue with empty shelvesHowever, to help combat the spread of the virus, Promise Land Funeral Home implemented a drive-thru funeral option, which was started by the previous owner, Howard Fields."When the COVID virus came it was almost like it was inspirational to make that because there are so many family members – that were afraid to even come into the funeral home that wanted to see their deceased loved ones," Fields said.Fields said the funeral home is now more prepared for COVID-related funerals."No one has to come inside the building. You can stay inside your vehicle and keep down the spread of COVID," Cobb said.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPMorgues in Mobile, Alabama, are filling up too. Funeral home director C.J. Smalls said the number of funerals have doubled there."It’s really draining and even with the employees I’ve had several employees to quit because it was too much on them," Smalls said.Fowler says they thought they were in the clear, but things are getting worse again."We sent it away because things had died down some months, we had like five or maybe three deaths. Then when the delta virus came in things started picking back up, so we said we were going to go ahead and plan," Fowler said.Get all the stories you need-to-know from the most powerful name in news delivered first thing every morning to your inboxSubscribedYou've successfully subscribed to this newsletter!This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2022 FOX News Network, LLC.

The department and Mayor Jenny A. Durkan’s office did not immediately respond to after-hour emails from Fox News.The Officer Down Memorial Page said 132 members of law enforcement have died of COVID-19 this year. Last year, the total figure was 241—making the virus the leading cause of law enforcement line-of-duty deaths.No national statistics show the vaccination rate for America’s entire population of first responders but individual police and fire departments across the country report figures far below the national rate of 74% of adults who have had at least one dose.The KTTH report said Durkan’s mandate requires city workers to take the jab by Oct. 18 or face termination. The report said losing 200 additional officers after last year’s push to defund could be devastating to the city.The city has been negotiating with the Seattle Police Officer’s Guild, the report said. In August, Mike Solan, the president of the union, said on a podcast that the mandate could lead to terminations.GET THE FOX NEWS APP"If you are advocating for more police officers because you know crime is on the rise, you need more cops because of what the City Council did," he said, accordingto KOMO News."Why are you threatening us with our jobs (if) you don’t get this vaccination.

Ron DeSantisto ban the requirement as courtroom battles continue over whether parents should be able to make such decisions amid a surge of positive COVID-19 cases related to the highly contagious delta variant.Several school districts are challenging theRepublicangovernor weeks into the new school year. On Tuesday, school board members in Orange County agreed with the school superintendent that most students should be required to wear masks through Oct. 30.The district initially began the school year allowing parents to opt out, but a surge in COVID-19 cases in the Orlando area has disrupted classes.FLORIDA SCHOOL BOARD DEFIES DESANTIS, SETS 90-DAY MASK POLICY AFTER HEATED MEETINGThrough Thursday, the district reported 2,201 positive cases among students since school began, with 2,079 people under active quarantine, according to the district’sdashboard.At least six school districts – Miami-Dade, Broward, Palm Beach, Hillsborough, Sarasota and Alachua – have issued mask requirements for students and school staff, theMiami Heraldreported.In Fort Lauderdale, the Broward County Public Schools board told the state Department of Education that it won't walk back its mask policy for students and employees. The policy allows a medical opt-out for students.State education officials sent a letter to the district earlier this month asking for daily numbers of students who refuse to wear masks.On Wednesday morning, police said the father of a student who tried to enter Fort Lauderdale High School without a mask was arrested after he forcefully pushed another student who tried to grab his cellphone. A police report said the father was recording video of students at the school’s front gate and the student didn’t want to be filmed.The father was charged with one count of aggravated child abuse.In Monroe County, the school board decided to require masks rather than strongly encourage them. The move also allows parents to choose.The board of Florida's largest school district, the Miami-Dade County Public Schools, voted earlier this month in favor of a mask requirement.A student listens to the teacher's instructions at iPrep Academy on the first day of school on Aug. 23 in Miami.

At a news conference Wednesday, the governor warned of additional consequences for defiant schools districts, but didn’t elaborate. He contends those boards are violating the Parents Bill of Rights, signed into law this summer. It gives parents the authority to direct their children’s education."Those schools districts are violating state law and they are overriding what the parents’ judgment is on this," he said, stressing repeatedly that cloth masks don’t prevent the spread of aerosols.In July, he issued anexecutive orderpreventing local mask mandates.Last week, the state Board of Education order the Alachua and Broward County school districts to comply with the governor's order. On the same day, Alachua Superintendant Carlee Simon said the district would not back down from its mask policy."If necessary, we will pursue legal action to ensure that we maintain local control over our schools, and are able to meet our obligation to provide a safe learning environment for all students," she said in a statement.The state had given Broward and Alachua counties until Tuesday to end their mask mandates. Broward’s students began school a week ago with a mask policy in place. State officials have threatened to withhold funding equal to school board salaries if a district doesn’t comply. Those funds make up less than 1% of each district’s budget.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPA ruling is expected Friday in Tallahasse where pro-masks parents were pitted against DeSantis and state education officials in court."I take my rights and my freedom very seriously," testified Jennifer Gillen, who supports the governor’s order and has two sons in Lee County schools where there is no strict mask mandate. "Our rights are actually being threatened."Christina Pushaw, press secretary for DeSantis, recently told Fox News that President Biden is focused on politicizing the pandemic to distract from the crisis in Afghanistan."Governor DeSantis seeks the best advice and expertise from all over the world; his detractors simply accept the proclamations of the CDC as though they are infallible," she said. "However, the CDC’s guidance has flip-flopped many times, and U.S. public health authorities have lost the trust of the American people. In other countries, COVID-19 is not as politicized, so it makes sense that the EU is following a more data-driven, pro-child approach. Biden is leaning into his signature issue – forced-masking kindergarteners – to distract from the catastrophe in Afghanistan."Fox News' Jessica Chasmar as well as The Associated Press contributed to this report.Louis Casiano is a reporter for Fox News Digital.

"Masks are now required outdoors at all times while students are on campus, unless they are eating."On rainy days, when lunch is held indoors, students can unmask to eat but will be required to maintain social distancing "as much as possible.""It’s the safest way of continuing to keep kids safe and continuing to minimize the possibility that the virus could spread on a school campus," San Diego Unified School Board President Richard Barrera told theUnion-Tribunenewspaper.(iStock)GOP CONGRESSMAN INTRODUCES BIL LTO GIVE LIABILITY PROTECTIONS FOR REOPENING SCHOOLS AND COLLEGESStudents who show up without a mask will be provided one, according to the guidebook. But if they decline to submit to the district’s mask mandate, they’ll be offered virtual classes.The school's guidelines are stricter than county health recommendations that urge people to mask up indoors regardless of vaccine status, according toFOX 5 San Diego.Exemptions will be made for students with "certain medical/sensory/cognitive/behavioral needs" on a case-by-case basis.Page 16 explains that students must also mask up at their bus stops and while riding the bus to school. Drivers are only required to wear a mask if they are within six feet of the nearest passenger, and a special seat behind the driver is being set aside on each bus in case someone becomes ill on the ride to or from school.The decision comes amid a nationwide fight over requiring children to wear masks in schools."Kids are the least vulnerable population, yet are struggling because of these ridiculous rules," San Diego County Supervisor Jim Desmond told Fox News Thursday. "Kids have suffered greatly from increased suicide rates, behavioral health issues and a lack of education."Desmond has questioned the necessity of mask and vaccine mandates and of keeping students out of their classrooms for a prolonged period."We need to learn to live with this virus and let kids be kids," he added Thursday. "A school district requiring more than our Public Health doctors, such as mandatory masking of kids outdoors, should not happen."Earlier this week, North Carolina Rep. Greg Murphy, a doctor, introduced a bill that would grant schools and colleges liability protections so long as they follow reasonable, good-faith health precautions.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP"As a physician of over 30 years and Ranking Member of the Higher Education and Workforce Innovation Subcommittee, there is nothing more important to me than the health and well-being of our students," he told Fox News before unveiling the legislation. "Leading experts agree that some students may lose as much as one year’s worth of educational progress in the absence of in-person learning."The legislation would allow each state to set its own guidelines, rather than the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but would allow for greater local control and protection from potentially frivolous lawsuits while protecting students, staff and visitors.Michael Ruiz is a reporter for Fox News Digital.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.AllNew York Citypublic school teachers and other staffers will have to get vaccinated against thecoronavirus, officials said Monday, ramping up pandemic protections as the nation's largest school system prepares for classes to start next month.The city previously said teachers, like other city employees, would have to get the shots or get tested weekly for the virus. The new policy marks the first no-option vaccination mandate for a broad group of city workers in the nation's most populous city, thoughMayor Bill de Blasioannounced Friday that coaches and students in football, basketball and other "high-risk" sports would have to get inoculated before play begins.Now, about 148,000 school employees — and contractors who work in schools — will have to get at least a first dose by Sept. 27, according to an announcement from the Democratic mayor and the city health and education departments.Students, teachers, administrators and counselors listen as principal Malik Lewis, second from left, teaches them a history lesson at West Brooklyn Community High School in New York in October 2020. (AP)NYC MAYOR DE BLASIO BOOED AT CONCERT CUT SHORT BY HENRI STORMS"We’re going to do whatever it takes to make sure that everyone is safe and that we push back delta," de Blasio said. Schools Chancellor Meisha Ross Porter called the policy "another layer of protection for our kids," including her own 11th-grader.The city hasn't immediately said what the penalty will be for refusing, or whether there will be exemptions. The previous vaccinate-or-test requirement had provisions for unpaid suspensions for workers who didn't comply.Unions that represent school employees said they needed answers — and negotiations.Michael Mulgrew, president of the United Federation of Teachers, said its priority was "keeping our kids safe and the schools open," but provisions for medical exceptions and other details needed to be negotiated and "if necessary, resolved by arbitration." The city principals’ union, the Council of School Supervisors & Administrators, said it would "work to protect our members’ rights and interests at the bargaining table."Custodians' union President Robert Troeller said he was concerned that the city had announced the requirement without bargaining.Troeller said he believed about 60% of the 850 members of Local 891 of the International Union of Operating Engineers had gotten at least a first shot. But at least some who haven't "are dead-set against this," he said.MSNBC COLUMN: PARENTS ‘FUELING’ RISE IN VIOLENCE AGAINST EDUCATORS OVER MASKSDe Blasio said the city would start bargaining this week with the unions over specifics, and officials hope for agreements. But the mayor said the city intends to implement the requirement Sept. 27, with or without a deal.At least 63% of all school employees already have been vaccinated. That figure doesn't include those who may have gotten their shots outside the city.The new requirement came as federal regulators gave full approval to Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine, one of three vaccines available in the U.S. All already have authorization for emergency use, but officials hope the full approval will increase public confidence in the vaccines.School starts Sept. 13 for the city's roughly 1 million public school students, with no remote-learning option planned. Last year, families could choose between all-virtual learning and a blend of in-person and remote classes.New York and some other cities and states have been fighting the virus' highly contagious delta variant by ratcheting up pressure to get more people inoculated.New York City last week began requiring proof of vaccination t o enter restaurant dining rooms, gyms and many other public places, a first-in-the-nation policy that a few other cities have copied since it was announced. Meanwhile, New York state announced last week that hospital and nursing home workers would have to get inoculated.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPVaccine mandates for teachers are fairly rare so far in the U.S., though Washington state, for one, says teachers must be inoculated or face dismissal. Vaccinate-or-test requirements are somewhat more common, existing in places including Los Angeles and Chicago, which are the two biggest U.S. school districts after New York.A new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that about 6 in 10 Americans say students and teachers should be required to wear face masks while in school, and that teachers and eligible students should also be required to get vaccinated. But Democrats and Republicans differ sharply on these issues, the poll found.Get all the stories you need-to-know from the most powerful name in news delivered first thing every morning to your inboxSubscribedYou've successfully subscribed to this newsletter!This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2022 FOX News Network, LLC.

Greg Murphy isintroducingaCOVID-19school reopening bill Monday that will ensure liability protections for academic institutions that take "good-faith" precautions to protect students, staff and visitors.Those measures would be left up to each state, and not the federal government."As a physician of over 30 years and Ranking Member of the Higher Education and Workforce Innovation Subcommittee, there is nothing more important to me than the health and well-being of our students," Murphy, a doctor, told Fox News Friday. "Leading experts agree that some students may lose as much as one year’s worth of educational progress in the absence of in-person learning."REP. GREG MURPHY, MD: OUR SCHOOLS NEED LIABILITY PROTECTION IN ORDER TO REOPEN FOR STUDENTSHe said long-term remote learning has been linked to depression, anxiety and loneliness and can expose children to cyberbullying and "internet addiction."File(iStock)The Open Schools Responsibly Act aims to protect schools and colleges from lawsuits and fines over students, employees and visitors who risk contracting or spreading the coronavirus once academic institutions reopen for the fall semester."While parents and teachers have done an admirable job adapting to virtual learning in the past year and a half, there is absolutely no substitute for in-person learning," Murphy said. "This is especially true for children in rural areas who have had greater difficulty keeping up with school without reliable internet services."The bill, which has support from the conservative policy group Heritage Action, includes a sunset provision for 2025.Murphy, a doctor, had introduced similar legislation last year and penned a Fox News op-ed in support of his plan.The new version allows states to set their own coronavirus guidelines and no longer recognizes guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, allowing for more local control by districts with a range of needs and concerns.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP"A public school in Los Angeles will have very different rules than a private school in North Carolina," Murphy said. "No schools should be sued for making a good-faith effort to follow their state’s guidelines."It also keeps local residents off the hook by protecting public schools from liabilities."If a school becomes devastated by a massive lawsuit, the financial burden will be on the taxpayer to foot the bill for legal expenses," Murphy said.Michael Ruiz is a reporter for Fox News Digital.

But with regard to the spread of virus in the country, I mean, I think if you look at wearing a mask and the filtration on planes, things are reasonably safe," he added.During the Dec. 19 "This Week" episode, Fauci said that he doesn't think there will be a point where masks are unnecessary on airplanes.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPDr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, speaks during a Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee hearing on Capitol Hill, Thursday, Nov. 4, 2021, in Washington.(AP Photo/Alex Brandon)"I think when you're dealing with a closed space, even though the filtration is good that you want to go that extra step," Fauci said.

The last helper was a lob that Claxton caught with two hands while soaring over James, who had just helped Los Angeles erase a 20-point deficit. Claxton posterized the 17-time All-Star, then made a free throw for a three-point play and a 118-115 lead.CLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE NBA COVERAGEIt had been more than two weeks since Harden last played, missing time because of a stint in theNBA's health and safety protocols before the Nets had their past three games postponed because they didn't have enough players.After "doing a lot of nothing," as Harden described it.

Bruce Brown had 16 points and DeAndre’ Bembry had 15."Obviously missing a lot of our guys, some guys had to step up and they did that tonight," Harden said.James matched a season high with 39 points to pass Kobe Bryant formost career points on Christmas Day, but it was not enough to stop the Lakers’ losing streak from reaching five. Russell Westbrook had 13 points, 11 assists and 12 rebounds for his second career holiday triple-double, and Malik Monk chipped in 20 points.James passed Bryant with the first of two free throws with 3:52 left in the first half of his 16th game on Christmas, tying Bryant’s record for most appearances. James has 422 points on the holiday to Bryant’s 395."I don’t really care about the way I play if it comes in a loss," James said.Harden figured he would be able to get some rest when the Nets took a 102-82 lead into the fourth quarter, only for the Lakers to come roaring back and tie it on Monk’s layup off a pass by James with 45 seconds remaining.Then Harden went back to Claxton on the alley-oop.

"And sometimes we do, and sometimes we don’t, and we’re not going to win like that and everybody knows it."Harden is the eighth player to record a triple-double on Christmas, joining exclusive company afterKemba Walker of the Knicksdid it earlier in the day. James, Westbrook, Draymond Green, Billy Cunningham, John Havlicek and Oscar Robertson round out the club."Sometimes I think he should be more aggressive, but he always makes the right play," Brown said of Harden’s fifth triple-double this season.The triple-doubles from Harden and Westbrook marked the first time opposing players did it in thesame Christmas game.Westbrook joined Robertson as just the second player with multiple triple-doubles on Christmas, something Robertson did four times.

If you are vaccinated and over the age of 70 and otherwise healthy – cruise cautiously.

The school has announced a two-week remote learning period to start off the spring semester in January 2022. (File)"This two-week remote learning period is designed to minimize disruptions for students who may be unable to travel or who must isolate because of COVID-19. It will also allow a period for gateway testing of all students prior to the start of in-person classes," a university email said.In making that announcement, Columbia cited other "peer institutions" that are doing the same thing — namely,Harvard, which recently announced it's shifting to remote operations for the first three weeks of January. Stanford University in California reportedly announced a similar policy on Thursday, going to online instruction for the first two weeks of its winter quarter.OMICRON VARIANT OF COVID-19 LESS LIKELY TO PUT PEOPLE IN HOSPITAL, STUDIES SUGGESTDuke University in North Carolina said that most classes from January 5 to January 8 would be remote, but that in-person classes are likely to resume January 10, according to reports.Dr. Marc Siegel, Fox News medical analyst and a professor of medicine at New York University Langone Medical Center in New York City, said several days ago that it's "very premature" for colleges to discuss plans to shift to remote learning for the spring 2022 semester.He said universities have a "built-in quarantine situation" allowing for rapid testing and additional measures — such as making sure everyone has a COVID booster vaccination, as Fox News reported earlier this week.Meantime, UCLA has said its classes will start on January 3 as planned — but the first two weeks will be held remotely and students are being instructed to return to campus by January 9 for testing.UNIVERSITIES ANNOUNCE REMOTE START TO SPRING SEMESTER DUE TO OMICRONIn Washington, D.C., George Washington University sent out an email to students on Wednesday that read, in part: "We write today to update you on our planning for spring semester operations. The number of positive COVID-19 cases among our community members continues to increase and remains high."It added, "This current surge, largely fueled by the Omicron variant, has required us to review our approach to how we return to campus in the new year and commence the Spring 2022 semester while ensuring our students, faculty and staff remain healthy and safe."Students walk on the Stanford University campus in Stanford, Calif., on March 14, 2019. Stanford students will begin their spring semester starting January 2022 with two weeks of online learning. (AP Photo/Ben Margot, File)(AP Photo/Ben Margot)The school continued, "Our Medical Advisory Group continues to monitor data on COVID-19 transmission on our campuses and in the region, as well as local and federal public health guidance. In addition, the CDC is predicting a potential peak in COVID-19 cases in January. Based on this information, we are developing plans based on a number of scenarios."It went on, "At this time, we plan to begin the spring semester virtually to allow for a gradual and careful in-person return to campus. We anticipate that this will be a temporary adjustment, and we are projecting that full in-person operations will resume on January 18, following the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday. The university, including libraries and laboratories, will reopen after winter break on January 3."In upstate New York, Syracuse University told its students, parents, alumni, and wider community in an email distributed on Thursday, "Given the sharp increase in COVID cases, the rapid spread of the Omicron variant, and warnings from public health officials that the first three weeks of January will be the most challenging of this surge, the University will delay the start of the spring semester for one week."Syracuse University's email continued, "In-person class will now begin on January 24" — then added, "Spring break will remain as previously scheduled: March 13-20."Syracuse's chancellor, Kent Syverud, also told students in the email that he is "optimistic for the spring semester because we have done this before. Syracuse University has safely and successfully held three in-person semesters of instruction in the midst of the pandemic … What is different for this upcoming semester is that we have booster shots that are proven to be both safe and effective," he continued.GET THE FOX NEWS APP HEREHe added as well, "Booster shots will be required by the start of the new semester, or as soon as you are eligible to do so."The Universities of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and at Chicago said that they will start the spring semester online.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.White House chief medical adviserDr. Anthony Faucisaid Friday that an upcoming surge of theomicron variant of the coronaviruswas "inevitable."Speaking at theWhite HouseCOVID-19 response team briefing, Fauci said the U.S. is looking over its shoulder at oncoming omicron infections."We are in a situation: we are now facing a very important delta surge and we are looking over our shoulder at an oncoming omicron surge," he said.COVID-19 OMICRON AND DELTA VARIANTS BRING US A DOUBLE SURGE"Clearly,unvaccinatedindividuals … are really at a high risk of serious involvement, including hospitalization. The fully vaccinated are doing much better off but, as I've shown you … the optimum protection is fully vaccinated plus a boost," Fauci added.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) DirectorDr. Rochelle Walensky announcedthat the seven-day average of hospital admissions had increased by about 4% and deaths had increased by more than 8% from the prior week."Although delta continues to circulate widely in the United States, omicron is increasing rapidly and we expect it to become the dominant strain in the United States – as it has in other countries – in the coming weeks," she said. "We've seen cases of omicron among those who are both vaccinated and boosted and we believe these cases are milder or asymptomatic because of vaccine protection."A line stretches down the block as people wait in line to be tested for COVID-19 in New York on Thursday, Dec. 16, 2021.(AP Photo/Brooke Lansdale)"What we do know is we have the tools to protect ourselves against COVID-19," the Walensky noted, echoing previous comments by White House COVID-19 response coordinator Jeff Zients.Zients said the administration was intent on not letting omicron disrupt work in school for the vaccinated, but said the unvaccinated are looking at a "winter of severe illness and death.""We are prepared to confront this new challenge," he pledged, adding that while "this is not a moment to panic," the American people need to do their part.CDC datashows that more than 203 million Americans have been fully vaccinated and more than 57 million have received a booster dose since Aug. 13.The Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center showsthat more than 50 million cases have been confirmed in the U.S. and more than 800,000 people have died from the virus.COVID-19 PANDEMIC DEATH TOLL TOPS 800,000 IN U.S.Recently, many states have seen cases and hospitalizations climb and major universities have reported large COVID-19 outbreaks – including omicron cases. The variant has been detected in 39 states and CDC estimates suggest 3% of cases nationally involve the new variant.New YorkandCaliforniasaid that they would require people to mask up indoors, in an effort to stop the spread and lines at testing sites have gotten longer.In a Thursday interviewon the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation's "Path Forward," Fauci said the variant's transmissibility ensured its dominance."There are few things we know for certain and a couple of things that we can make a rather reasonable assumption about," he said. "The first that we know for sure: that it is highly, highly transmissible. It is the most transmissible virus of COVID that we've had to deal with thus far. It has a doubling time of about three days which means, if you do the math on that, you see how quickly over a period of time that the dominant variant will be omicron – as it is in South Africa, as it is now approaching that in the U.K. And, if things go in the United States the way they've gone in other countries – and there's no reason to believe that that won't be the case – it will soon become dominant here."The infectious disease expert also pointed out that the large number of mutations on the omicron variant is predictive and has shown in reality to evade certain immune parameters, such as monoclonal antibodies.With omicron, antibodies induced by vaccination lose much of their potency, although Fauci noted that those who have been fully vaccinated and boosted can "reconstitute a lot of that diminished protection.""It may not protect much against infection, but it will go a long way to protect against severe disease. So, therefore underscoring the real importance of getting vaccinated, as well as getting boosted," he continued, next underscoring the importance of not making assumptions regarding its severity.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPAll of this comes amidst what Fauci said is a difficult situation, due to the 50 million Americans who remain unvaccinated."The very vulnerable people … are predominantly … the unvaccinated," he explained. "And that's the reason why as we get into the depths of the winter with the travel and the holiday season upon us, that it is essential to get the unvaccinated people vaccinated. And importantly, particularly, with regard to omicron…"Hospitals, he added, could be overwhelmed in the coming months – though he said he would not object to family gatherings for theholidays, if people are vaccinated.Stay up-to-date on the biggest health and wellness news with our weekly recap.SubscribedYou've successfully subscribed to this newsletter!This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2022 FOX News Network, LLC.

But they also don't have a clear plan for when or how they will lift the mandates that require millions of Americans to show documents to enterrestaurants, gyms and more."It doesn't come with an end date because we don't know what's coming," Philadelphia Health Commissioner Cheryl Bettigole said of her city's vaccine mandate for restaurants. "We have winter and omicron on the horizon. It's very hard to predict what could happen next. We do want to roll this back as soon as we can, but that's going to depend on our case rates and hospitalization rates."Philadelphia is just one of several major metropolitan areas in the U.S. with vaccine mandates for people to enter public places like restaurants. New York City, the City of Los Angeles, Seattle and San Francisco all have similar mandates. And New Orleans requires people to present proof of vaccination or a recent negative COVID-19 test to get into places like bars and restaurants.Vaccine mandates are often sold as ways to roll back mask mandates and get back to normal – at least inside the spaces where only vaccinated people are allowed. In fact, Los Angeles County released guidance earlier this year that explicitly tied the lifting of its mask mandate to businesses requiring vaccines.A health care worker, left, checks in a man at a NYC mobile vaccine clinic in Midtown Manhattan, Monday, Dec. 6, 2021.(AP Photo/Mary Altaffer)PHILLY HEALTH COMMISSIONER WARNS AGAINST GATHERING WITH FAMILY DURING HOLIDAYS DUE TO COVIDThese cities say they eventually do want to return to the pre-pandemic normal. When asked by Fox News what their plans are to eventually roll back the mandates, most of them said they want to do so eventually. But none appear to have a clear plan for doing so."There is no specific end date at this time because it’s impossible to know what the next few months could look like due to the current delta wave and what we’re learning about the omicron variant," Philadelphia Department of Health spokesman James Garrow said when asked about his city's new vaccine mandate. "The health department is currently developing metrics that will be focused on case rates and hospitalizations to inform that rollback and will announce them at a future date.""Our vaccine mandate was put in place to slow the spread of the virus and encourage people to get vaccinated, while protecting those not yet eligible for vaccines," the San Francisco Department of Public Health said of its mandate for vaccines in bars, gyms, clubs and more."As we get more of our population vaccinated, we continue to monitor the data to measure the full effect of our current vaccine mandates and decide on next steps," the department added. "As it has been the case since the outset of the pandemic, we will be guided by science and, to the extent possible, will take a regional approach on our virus mitigation strategies."Mardi Gras crowds on Bourbon Street in New Orleans. The city will leave its vaccine-or-testing mandate in place until at least after carnival season.(AP Photo)OMICRON VARIANT: HERE'S WHAT WE KNOWNew Orleans did not answer a question from Fox News about what metrics would prompt officials to roll back the city's mandate. But a spokesman did say the vaccine-or-test rule will be in effect until at least late February or early March."The vaccine mandate — the requirement that individuals show proof of vaccination or a recent negative test to enter bars, restaurants and other facilities — will remain in place at least through Mardi Gras," spokesman Beau Tidwell said. "We welcome visitors to New Orleans for the holidays and for carnival, and we want them to be safe. You will be required to show proof of vaccination at bars and restaurants throughout carnival season."Seattle is unique in that its order actually has an expiration date – March 16, 2022. The original health order from September says the policy will be "reevaluated at that time or sooner based on the status and impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak in King County."Despite saying that Seattle looks "forward to the time when the threat of COVID-19 has receded and mandates are no longer necessary," Seattle and King County Health Officer Jeff Duchin did not provide Fox News any specific criteria that will factor into whether the mandate is extended. Duchin said Seattle will generally consider vaccination rates, the toll COVID-19 is taking on the health system, deaths, new variants and "unintended consequences of the mandates" when deciding whether to roll its rules back.Sarah Gonzalez, a nurse practitioner from New York, displays a COVID-19 vaccine card at a New York Health and Hospitals vaccine clinic in the Brooklyn borough of New York.

They've plateaued in recent weeks slightly below the August and September highs that prompted many places to reinstate mask mandates after rescinding them in the spring. And some public health officials appear to be shifting their recommendations more toward 2020 precautions than a post-pandemic era."Please do not get together with other households for Christmas, or if you do keep those gatherings small, have everyone do a rapid test before they come and ask everyone to stay home if they feel even a little bit unwell," Philadelphia's Bettigole said Wednesday. "Please do not hold or attend holiday parties indoors, it's just too dangerous."Fox News' Edmund DeMarche contributed to this report.Tyler Olson covers politics for Fox News Digital.

She explained that the anti-vaccine protest at Applebee’s drew "a small army of police officers."The host then played a video clip of Wednesday’s anti-vaccine protest, which ended with Rose being taken into custody.DANA PERINO SUGGESTS BIDEN HAS FAILED TO USE ‘VACCINE DIPLOMACY’ TO TACKLE COVID"Can’t work, can’t eat … I want to eat -- like the free American that I am!" Rose says, with police officers gathered around her."Can’t work, can’t eat … I want to eat -- like the free American that I am!""I can’t believe that’s a scene out of the United States of America," Ingraham said after the clip ended.Rose, a daughter of immigrants from the Dominican Republic who was raised in the Bronx, then spoke about her ordeal."Honestly, I myself supported NYPD last year when New York City was being burned down to the ground and I was home working remotely," she said. "I supported NYPD. I’m a registered Republican. I even voted for Trump."But now, as you see, the police officers that are supposed to work to protect us citizens are now taking orders from [New York City Mayor Bill] de Blasio, who last year told them to step down and allow our city to be burned down to the ground."I don’t know what that was all about. We were a group of teachers, health care workers, law-abiding citizens -- that our only crime that we committed was the fact that we wanted to eat, and we are unvaccinated."Our only crime that we committed was the fact that we wanted to eat, and we are unvaccinated."Rose said incidents such as the crackdown at Applebee’s were an indication that something had gone wrong in both New York City and in America."People look up to us for freedom. We are the last beacon of hope," Rose said. "What this tells me is that we are losing this country and, I always say this, that if we lose America there’s nowhere else to run. And if we do not stand up and fight for everyone’s rights, we are going to head into a totalitarian state. As you guys can see we’re already heading that way."Rose then explained that she hasn’t worked since Oct. 1 because of coronavirus restrictions."Like I said in the video, I cannot work, I cannot eat, and I’m an American-born citizen in this country," she said. "People should be very scared because if this is happening in America, this tells us that we are no longer free anymore."Ingraham then asked Rose why she didn’t simply yield to "worried liberals" who claim she should just get vaccinated.Rose answered by saying the liberals were "hypocrites" for claiming "Black lives matter" and preaching racial equality – but not supporting her as a Black woman."Now my Black life does not matter because it doesn’t support their agenda," she said. "I think it’s absolutely disgusting to call yourself a liberal and yet you want everyone else to do whatever you want them to do.""Now my Black life does not matter because it doesn’t support their agenda.

But she said nearly all of them were only mildly ill.In an interview with The Associated Press, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said the data is very limited and the agency is working on a more detailed analysis of what the new mutant form of the coronavirus might hold for the U.S.OMICRON VARIANT 'ALMOST CERTAINLY' LESS SEVERE THAN DELTA, FAUCI SAYS"What we generally know is the more mutations a variant has, the higher level you need your immunity to be. ... We want to make sure we bolster everybody’s immunity. And that’s really what motivated the decision to expand our guidance,"Walensky said, referencing the recent approval ofboosters for all adults.She said "the disease is mild" in almost all of the cases seen so far, with reported symptoms mainly cough, congestion and fatigue. One person was hospitalized, but no deaths have been reported, CDC officials said.Some cases can become increasingly severe as days and weeks pass, and Walensky noted that the data is a very early, first glimpse of U.S. omicroninfections. The earliest onset of symptoms of any of the first 40 or so cases was Nov. 15, according to the CDC.Hold for story - Dr. Rochelle Walensky, Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) speaks during an interview with the Associated Press on Wednesday, Dec. 8, 2021, in Atlanta. The CDC on Wednesday gave new details of the first U.S. cases of the new omicron variant of COVID-19.(AP Photo/Brynn Anderson)The omicron variant wasfirst identified in South Africalast month and has since been reported in 57 countries, according to theWorld Health Organization.The first U.S. case was reported on Dec. 1. As of Wednesday afternoon, the CDC had recorded 43 cases in 19 states. Most were young adults. About a third of those patients hadtraveled internationally.More than three-quarters of those patients had been vaccinated, and a third had boosters, Walensky said. Boosters take about two weeks to reach full effect, and some of the patients had received their most recent shot within that period, CDC officials said.Fewer than 1% of the U.S. COVID-19 cases genetically sequenced last week were the omicron variant;the deltavariantaccounted for more than 99%.OMICRON IN THE US: WHERE IS IT THIS WEEK?Scientistsare trying to better understandhow easily it spreads.British officialssaid Wednesday that they think the omicron variant could become the dominant version of the coronavirusin the United Kingdomin as soon as a month.The CDC has yet to make any projections on how the variant could affect the course of the pandemic in the U.S. Walensky said officials are gathering data but many factors could influence how the pandemic evolves."When I look to what the future holds, so much of that is definitely about the science, but it’s also about coming together as a community to do things that prevent disease in yourself and one another. And I think a lot of what our future holds depends on how we come together to do that," she said.The CDC is also trying to establish whether the omicron variant causes milder — or more severe — illness than other coronavirus types. The finding that nearly all of the cases so far are mild may be a reflection that this first look at U.S. omicron cases captured mainly vaccinated people, who are expected to have milder illnesses, CDC officials said.Another key question is whether it is better at evading vaccines or the immunity people build from a bout with COVID-19.This week, scientists inSouth Africareported a small laboratory study that found antibodies created by vaccines were not as effective at preventing omicron infections as they were at stopping other versions of the coronavirus.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPOn Wednesday, vaccine manufacturer Pfizer said that while two doses may not be protective enough to prevent infection, lab tests showed abooster increased levelsofvirus-fightingantibodies by 25-fold.Blood samples taken a month after a booster showed people harbored levels of omicron-neutralizing antibodies that were similar to amounts proven protective against earlier variants after two doses, the company said.Stay up-to-date on the biggest health and wellness news with our weekly recap.SubscribedYou've successfully subscribed to this newsletter!This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2022 FOX News Network, LLC.

"But we do require for travel — we’re going to continue to require people to have masks on — masks on — and in public places, and — and federal buildings."Biden added: "I continue to rely on the scientists and asking them whether or not we have to move beyond what we did yesterday. Right now, they’re saying no."Surgeon General Vivek Murthy delivers remarks during a news conference with White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki at the White House in Washington, July 15, 2021.(REUTERS/Tom Brenner)Republicans argue that the vaccine requirements and masking rules the Biden administration is pushing are doing little but infringing on the freedom of Americans and hurting the economy.

The current mask mandate was slated to expire on Jan. 18 following an extension last August.The mask requirement has contributed to a spike in altercations on flights and other forms of public transportation. Last month, Attorney General Merrick Garland ordered the Justice Department to enhance its efforts to prosecute unruly passengers."We base our decisions on the advice of the health and medical experts," Psaki said, noting that officials are looking at "a range of factors as we make decisions about what steps we can put in place.""Again, nothing’s off the table," Psaki added.Holiday travelers walk through the Miami International Airport on Nov. 23, 2021.(AP Photo/Marta Lavandier)And White House coronavirus task force coordinator Jeffrey Zients this week was asked during an interview on MSNBC about a potential domestic flight vaccine requirement –  something he, too, left as an option."We do have those tight requirements on the international travel, we have the workplace requirements, we’ll continue to look at all options and everything’s on the table," Zients said.BIDEN ADMINISTRATION TO EXTEND TRANSPORTATION MASK REQUIREMENT THROUGH MID-MARCHThe changes in travel and mask requirements come as public health officials have expressed concern about the omicron variant, the latest mutant strain of COVID-19.Biden, last week, restricted travel from South Africa and seven other countries over concerns of the "heavily mutated" omicron variant of COVID-19 – a move he said Monday gives the United States "time."As for travel bans from other nations reporting cases of the omicron variant, the White House said it is continuing to "assess on a daily basis," and that the president will "always err on the side of protecting the American people.""The decision to put in specific travel restrictions from a set of countries was made based on the recommendation of our health and medical team and based on the fact that there were hundreds, if not thousands, of cases that we were seeing in South Africa and concerned about in neighboring countries," Psaki said. "So that was a decision that was made at that time – no one wants that to be permanent."She added that the administration is assessing whether "additional restrictions need to be put in place."But this week, a California resident who was vaccinated against COVID-19 was confirmed as the first U.S. case of the omicron variant.BIDEN TO ANNOUNCE HEALTH INSURERS MUST COVER 100% OF COST OF AT-HOME COVID TESTSThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Thursday also identified a second case of the variant in the United States – a Minnesota resident who had traveled to New York.As for the threat that the omicron poses, Psaki on Thursday said there is "a lot we don’t know.""And that is challenging, and frustrating, I understand, for Americans, for all of you," Psaki said. "And we want to give the space and time for the public health officials who are working 24/7 to assess and provide guidance on it."CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPShe added: "It could be less deadly, it could be more.

But the day before her flight, she started having doubts when she saw that Prague had closed its Christmas markets and imposed a citywide curfew."I wasn’t really concerned about my trip until the Czech Republic started what looked like a mini-lockdown process," said Moore, who decided to reschedule her travel to March.Less than a month after significantly easing restrictions for inbound international travel, the U.S. government has banned most foreign nationals who have recently been in any of eight southern African countries. A similar boomerang was seen in Japan and Israel, both of which tightened restrictions shortly after relaxing them.While it is not clear where the variant emerged, South African scientists identified it last week, and many places, including the European Union and Canada, have restricted travel from the wider region.For all the alarm, little is known about omicron, including whether it is more contagious, causes more serious illness or can evade vaccines.Still, governments that were slow to react to the first wave of COVID-19 are eager to avoid past mistakes. The World Health Organization says, however, that travel bans are of limited value and will "place a heavy burden on lives and livelihoods." Other experts say travel restrictions won’t keep variants out but might give countries more time to get people vaccinated.TRAVEL AMIDST OMICRON: WHO SAY PEOPLE AGED 60 AND OLDER SHOULD DELAY TRAVEL TO CERTAIN AREASLondon-based airline easyJet said Tuesday that renewed travel restrictions already appear to be hurting winter bookings, although CEO Johan Lundgren said the damage is not yet as severe as during previous waves.

Business travel is a little more uncertain," said Ari Klein, a hotels analyst for BMO Capital Markets.Israel’s decision to close the country to foreign visitors is hitting the nation’s tourism industry as it geared up for the Hanukkah and Christmas holidays. The country only opened to tourists in November, after barring most foreign visitors since early last year.Just over 30,000 tourists entered Israel in the first half of November, compared to 421,000 in November 2019, according to government figures.Joel Haber, a Jerusalem-based guide, said during a typical Hanukkah holiday his calendar would be chock full of food tours through Jerusalem’s colorful Mahane Yehuda market. Instead, he has just one tour a day."Tour guides like me are the first to get hit and the last to emerge and are directly prevented from working by a government decision," Haber said.In the West Bank city of Bethlehem, revered by Christians as Jesus’ birthplace, local businesses expected a boost from Christmas tourism. The Bethlehem Hotel, one of the largest in the city, has operated at a fraction of capacity for the past 18 months."Everyone who had bookings over the next two weeks has canceled, while others are waiting to see what happens next," said the hotel’s manager, Michael Mufdi. "I don’t know how much longer we can last, but we are doing our best."The pandemic already caused foreign tourism in Japan to shrink from 32 million visitors in 2019 to 4 million last year, a trend that has continued through this year.As worries surfaced about omicron, Japan on Wednesday tightened its ban on foreign travelers, asking airlines to stop taking new reservations for all flights arriving in the country until the end of December. The country earlier reversed a relaxation of travel restrictions that had been in effect just three weeks.The crowds of Chinese shoppers who used to arrive in Tokyo’s glitzy Ginza district in a stream of buses to snap up luxury items have long disappeared. Restaurants and bars have been forced to restrict hours.In Asakusa, a quaint part of town filled with souvenir shops, rickshaw drivers, and stalls selling traditional sweets, news of the omicron variant made little difference this week. Vendors say there hasn’t been any business for months except for a few local customers.In South Africa, Frederic Plachesi, owner of Tamboti lodge in Dinokeng Game Reserve, is facing a similar fall-off in the international guests his business relies on."The odds are for the next few months, only locals will visit the lodge," said Plachesi. "We estimate a 60% loss of business because of the omicron restrictions."In Europe, Alpine ski resorts worry about how to keep up with requirements such as ensuring all skiers are vaccinated or recovered from infection and have tested negative for the virus.Matthias Stauch, head of the German ski lift operators association VDS, said many are small family businesses that lack the staff to perform such checks. Meanwhile, the association is warning about "massive" economic damage to the tourism sector if there is another lockdown.Travel executives argue that government decisions about restrictions should wait until more is known about omicron, but they admit it's a difficult call.A Southwest Airlines plane lands at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport Nov. 23, 2021, in Arlington, Virginia.

"The overallglobal risk... is assessed as very high."In response to these reports, world health leaders have taken drastic and controversial measures in an attempt to stop the spread – issuingtravel restrictionsdespite pushback from the WHO andsouthern Africa, where omicron was first reported.Since then,South Africanand U.S. scientists have reportedly been communicating in an effort to understand more about the new variant and the WHO commended South Africa and Botswana for their "speed and transparency."WHO SKIPS OVER GREEK LETTERS 'NU' AND 'XI,' NAMES NEW VARIANT 'OMICRON'"It is expected that the omicron variant will be detected in an increasing number of countries as national authorities step up their surveillance and sequencing activities. WHO is closely monitoring the spread of the omicron variant, and studies are ongoing to understand more about these mutations and their impact on transmissibility, virulence, diagnostics, therapeutics andvaccines," the organization noted.All of this comes amidst a busyholidaytravel season, during which the WHO said essential travel should be prioritized.The agency instructed all travelers to remain vigilant for signs and symptoms of COVID-19, adhere to public health and social measures at all times regardless of vaccination status and get vaccinated against COVID-19 – which U.S. health leaders and theWhite House maintainsis the best way to protect against omicron and other variants.In addition, the WHO said countries should apply an evidence-informed and risk-based approach when implementing travel measures, including a "multilayered risk mitigation approach" devised to "potentially delay and/or reduce the exportation or importation of the new variant."CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPAlternatively, it warned that "blanket travel bans" would not prevent international spread and can "adversely impact global health efforts during a pandemic by disincentivizing countries to report and share epidemiological and sequencing data.""All countries should ensure that the measures are regularly reviewed and updated when new evidence becomes available on the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of omicron or any other [variant of concern]," the WHO advised.The Associated Press contributed to this report.Stay up-to-date on the biggest health and wellness news with our weekly recap.SubscribedYou've successfully subscribed to this newsletter!This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2022 FOX News Network, LLC.

The epidemiological situation in South Africa has been characterized by three distinct peaks in reported cases, the latest of which was predominantly the delta variant,"the WHO explained. "In recent weeks, infections have increased steeply, coinciding with the detection of B.1.1.529 variant. The first known confirmed B.1.1.529 infection was from a specimen collected on [Nov. 9, 2021]."The omicron variant, the agency noted, has a large number of mutations, "some of which are concerning." The variant has also been identified in Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Lesotho, Eswatini, Mozambique and Malawi.EU, UK, ISRAEL TO HALT AIR TRAVEL TO SOUTHERN AFRICA OVER NEW COVID-19 VARIANTThe WHO advisory group will continue to evaluate the variant and the WHO said it would communicate any new findings with member nations and to the public as is necessary.About a dozen other countries - including the United Kingdom, France, Germany and Italy - will create similar travel restrictions.

"This is really something that's in motion and we just arranged right now a discussion between our scientists and the South African scientists, a little bit later in the morning to really get the facts – because you're hearing a lot of things back and forth.""We want to find out, scientists to scientists, exactly what is going on," he said. "But it's something that has emerged in South Africa and seems to be spreading at a reasonably rapid rate, in the sense of when they do test positivity they're seeing it's a bit more widespread in South Africa than was originally felt a couple of days ago. So it's in a fluid motion. We're finding more about it and, literally, it's something that – in real time – we're learning more and more about."EU, UK, ISRAEL TO HALT AIR TRAVEL TO SOUTHERN AFRICA OVER NEW COVID-19 VARIANTIsrael said Fridaythat it had detected the country’s first case of the new variant in a traveler who returned from Malawi and that the traveler and two other suspected cases were placed in isolation. The variant has also reportedly been found in Botswana and Hong Kong intravelersfrom South Africa.Several countries – including the U.K., Israel and Italy – have already taken measures in an attempt to ward off the variant,including implementing travel restrictionson several countries in southern Africa."Is it possible it's already in the U.S.?" asked "New Day" co-host Brianna Keilar."Of course. Anything is possible," Fauci replied. "We don't know that. There's no indication that it is right now. It seemed to have been restricted.""There were some cases that originated in South Africa and that went to Botswana and people who traveled and found out they were infected and one that had gone, actually, to Hong Kong. So there's a lot of travel," he continued. "You never know exactly where, and that's the reason why we're getting together [with] them to try and get the precise molecular makeup of it, so you could actually test for it. And that's something that will take a little bit, to put the appropriate materials together to do that. But we are in very active communication with our South African colleague scientists."Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, takes his seat for a Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee hearing on Capitol Hill, Thursday, Nov. 4, 2021, in Washington.(AP Photo/Alex Brandon)Next, Keilar asked if the spike protein – which isfound on the surface of the virus that causes COVID-19and plays a critical role in triggering the immune system to produce antibodies – is "still permeable when it comes to thevaccine" with the new variant.The chief medical adviser on COVID-19 toPresident Bidensaid "that's what [scientists would] be finding out."COVID-19 VARIANT B.1.1.529: HERE'S WHAT WE KNOW"Because, when you look at a mutation, it can give you a hint or a prediction that it might evade the immune response. What you need to do is you need to get that particular sequence of thevirus, put it in a form in the lab where you can actually test the different antibodies. So you can have a prediction that it might evade or you can actually prove it. Right now, we're getting the material together with our South African colleagues to get a situation where you could actually directly test it," Fauci explained."So right now you're talking about sort of like a red flag that this might be an issue, but we don't know. Once you test it, you'll know for sure whether or not it does or does not evade the antibodies that we make, for example against the virus through a vaccine or following convalescing after you get infected. When you get antibodies, do those antibodies protect you against this new virus?" he asked. "The answer is we don't know right now, but we're going to find out for sure."As far as steps the U.S. can take to respond to the threat of this variant, including travel restrictions, Fauci asserted that there needed to be a scientific basis to do so.TheWorld Health Organization (WHO), in a Friday meeting, had called on nations to make decisions without "knee-jerk responses.""We’ve seen in the past, the minute there’s any kind of mention of any kind of variation and everyone is closing borders and restricting travel. It’s really important that we remain open, and stay focused," Dr. Michael Ryan, the head of emergencies at the WHO, urged."Well, I mean, obviously as soon as we find out more information we'll make a decision as quickly as we possibly can," Fauci said, following a question about potential travel restrictions by the U.S. "You always put these things on the table, but you don't want to say you're going to do it until you have some scientific reason to do it. That's the reason why we're rushing now to get that scientific data to try and make an informed decision about something like that."CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPIn terms of immediate action, should cases of the heavily mutated variant crop up in the U.S., the health leader told Keilar that the first step is finding out if the variant does evade current vaccines."I mean, there's always the possibility of doing what the U.K. has done – namely block travel from South Africa and related countries. We don't know that. That's certainly something you think about and get prepared to do. You're prepared to do everything you need to do to protect the American public. But you want to make sure there's a basis for doing that, and that's what we're doing right now," he concluded.The Associated Press contributed to this report.Stay up-to-date on the biggest health and wellness news with our weekly recap.SubscribedYou've successfully subscribed to this newsletter!This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2022 FOX News Network, LLC.

If you have the tiniest tickle in your throat, the tiniest feeling, worry about yourself and worry about everybody else, and know Santa will always be there next year," said 57-year-old Kevin Chesney, who's been donning the big red suit since he was a kid.Amid a downturn in Jolly Old Elves – about 15% fewer in one large database – Chesney is busier than ever from his North Pole in Moorestown, New Jersey. The photo studio where he works quickly sold out its 4,500 appointments to sit with him and the seven other Santas in the studio's stable.Santa, Sid Fletcher, and Kendra Alexander of St. James, Minnesota, are separated by a glass barrier during her visit Monday, Nov. 15, 2021, in the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota.(AP Photo/Jim Mone)I’M A TRUCKER WHO IS PROUD TO BE DRIVING THE NATION’S CHRISTMAS TREE TO WASHINGTONThey're among the brave in Santa's ranks with full-contact visits, lap sitting included, though Chesney wears a mask until just before the photos are taken.Other Santas might not be wearing masks or plastic face shields, or hanging out in protective snow globes like many did last year, but it seems 50-50 this season that they're not quite ready for hugs, whispers in their ears for secret wishes, and kids smiling or sobbing on their knees.Some Santas will remain behind barriers that popped up last year for safety. At Minnesota's Mall of America, the big man will be housed in a log cabin behind a window with guests seated on benches in front of him. At 169 locations for the outdoor retailers Bass Pro Shops and Cabela's, benches will also be used, with plastic partitions deployed at some stores for Santa's photo ops.Other retailers and Santa hosts are offering the option of no or full contact, even when mandates to distance aren’t in place. And many require or encourage reservations online to cut down on the number of people waiting.More than 10 million U.S. households visited Santa in a mall or store in 2019, according to GlobalData Retail’s managing director, Neil Saunders. Nearly 73% of them also spent money at nearby restaurants or stores, he said. Last year, the company’s research found that 6.1 million households visited Santa, with fewer retailers and malls offering the holiday star in person. Of those visitors, 62% ate or shopped nearby.Saunders said projections this year have about 8.9 million households expected to visit Santa in person, with virtual visits still a big option."Lingering concerns about the virus and ongoing restrictions in some states and localities continue to act as a brake on visiting Santa in person," he said.Chris Landtroop, a spokeswoman for Santa vendor Cherry Hill Programs, is optimistic. The new rollout of vaccinations for children 5 to 11 will certainly help."Santa is so back and we are super excited about that. Last year was incredibly tough," Landtroop said.The company has been sourcing Santas all year for the 800 malls, big-box stores and other locations it serves, with options for no-contact visits, too. Cherry Hill requires its Santas and other employees to be vaccinated and those with exemptions to be tested regularly."At the end of the day, we want guests to feel comfortable," Landtroop said.Santa, Sid Fletcher, waves from behind a glass barrier and a letter drop Monday, Nov. 15, 2021, at the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota.(AP Photo/Jim Mone)Luther Landon has been providing the Santa Experience at Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota, for nearly two decades. Last year, he hit on the log cabin idea but was shut down after a day due to the pandemic. He pivoted to virtual Santa and this year will offer both."We think that it would be very irresponsible of us to just ignore it and pretend like everything’s back to normal," he said of the pandemic. "We've hidden some microphones so Santa can hear just fine. I know from our Santa community and knowing so many other Santas that the majority of them are reluctant, highly reluctant, to go back to the way it was before the pandemic. But we also have some who are just like, you know what, I don’t care. Having both of those groups is what's happening in the country, too."Russell Hurd in Royse City, Texas, has been playing Santa since 2017, after he retired from the Army. He'll be in his red suit to go with his long – and very real – white beard at the Gaylord Texan Resort & Convention Center near Dallas. His visits with the throngs are distanced and masks are required. He longs for that to end."The way it used to be, it's meaningful for us Santas, too. I mean, we’re human beings. We crave that interaction, but for now we do what we can," Hurd said.Hurd is unvaccinated and tests regularly for COVID."I know a lot of unvaxxed Santas across the country. I mean, it’s not just Texas." he said.Count American Dream, a mega mall of 3 million square feet in East Rutherford, New Jersey, among retailers offering distanced Santa. He'll be on ice, skating the indoor rink with visitors, and also tooling around with guests in hot pink golf carts.At Macy's stores, Santa will be making his list and checking it twice from behind a desk, with guests seated on the other side."We're encouraging everyone to maintain masking throughout their visits," said Kathleen Wright, senior manager at Macy's Branded Entertainment. "Santa has been a part of the Macy’s tradition since 1862 so we're overjoyed that we can safely continue the tradition this year."At Oakbrook Center, a mall in suburban Chicago owned by Brookfield Properties, Santa's spot is a tricked-out motorhome with his fans allowed inside. Santa will be happening at 117 of 132 malls Brookfield owns in 43 states. The company is following local mandates on safety protocols but will distance anyone who asks. The same goes for CBL Properties, which owns 63 malls in 24 states and offered Santa visits from a safe distance last year.Santa, Sid Fletcher, sits behind glass as he gets a Christmas wish list from Kendra Alexander of St. James, Minnesota, during her visit Monday, Nov. 15, 2021, at the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota.(AP Photo/Jim Mone)"We're bringing back a more traditional Santa experience this year," said CBL spokeswoman Stacey Keating. "Visitors who wish to do so will be able to sit on Santa’s lap or on Santa’s bench. Masks will not be required at the set or during photos unless there's a local mandate in place."And, bonus: "We're also bringing back pet photo nights with Santa," she said, "as well as Santa Cares, a reservation-only event that caters to those with sensory sensitivities and for whom the traditional experience may be too overwhelming."The pandemic has taken its toll on Santa in other ways.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPStephen Arnold, the 71-year-old head of IBRBS (formerly the International Brotherhood of Real Bearded Santas) said his organization of about 2,000 Santas and Mrs. Clauses has lost 57 Santas to COVID."Most of us are overweight, diabetic, with heart conditions," said Arnold, a longtime Santa working this year both virtually and in person in Memphis, Tennessee.

It can be safe if you’re fully vaccinated againstCOVID-19, but officials say people who haven’t gotten the shots should delay travel.Regardless of vaccination status, all travelers should keep taking precautions like avoiding indoor, unmasked crowds, says Dr. Keith Armitage, an infectious disease expert at Case Western Reserve University.FAUCI PROMOTING THANKSGIVING FOR VACCINATED AMERICANS, WARNING UNVAXXED IS ‘GOOD FOR MARKETING’: MAKARYTravelers check in at the Qatar Airways check-in counter inside the international terminal at San Francisco International Airport (SFO) in San Francisco on Monday, Nov. 8, 2021.

"Happy Thanksgiving!"Earlier this month, Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., and Rep. John Katko, R-N.Y., sent a letter to TSA Administrator David Pekoske expressing concern that there would be staffing shortages in light of the mandate, following a television interview where Pekoske had said only 60% had been vaccinated.THANKSGIVING TRAVEL HURDLES: SURGE IN DEMAND, AIRLINE STAFFING WOES COULD HAVE IMPACTA senior administration official told Fox News Monday that the Biden administration has achieved 95% compliance across the federal government—meaning that employees have had at least their first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, or have pending or approved exception or extension requests.The official said that more than 90% of those employees have had at least one shot, with "the vast majority of those employees being fully vaccinated.""These numbers make one thing perfectly clear: vaccination requirements work," the official said, adding that the Nov. 22 deadline "is not an end point," noting that officials continue to see federal employees providing their information and getting vaccinated.Pekoske had been confident that the agency would be ready to handle the surge in holiday travelers regardless of the vaccine mandate."Implementation of the mandate will make travel safer and healthier for everyone," Pekoske said. "So, we see quite a significant increase in the number of our officers that are vaccinated, and I’m very confident that there will be no impact for Thanksgiving.""We are prepared," Pekoske told ABC’s "Good Morning America," but warned that travelers should still expect long wait times to pass through security at airports across the country due to the surge in holiday travelers.The American Automobile Association (AAA) predicts that more than 53.4 million people will travel this year, in what will be the highest single-year increase since 2005.Travel for the holiday, AAA noted, is up 13% from 2020, bringing volumes within 5% ofpre-pandemiclevels.TheTransportation Security Administration (TSA) saidit expects to screen about 20 million passengers during the Thanksgiving holiday.4 SMART TIPS FOR THANKSGIVING TRAVELThe busiest days are typically the Tuesday and Wednesday prior to Thanksgiving and the Sunday afterward.While travel volume this year is not expected to reach pre-pandemic levels when nearly 2.9 million individuals were screened at TSA security checkpoints nationwide, the agency said it is expected to be notably higher in the time leading up to Thanksgiving."We anticipate that travel may be very close to pre-pandemic levels this holiday, and we are staffed and prepared for the holiday travelers. We have deployed technologies that enhance detection capabilities and reduce physical contact, and it’s equally important that passengers are prepared with travel tips for the most efficient checkpoint experience," Pekoske said. "With overall vaccination rates improving nationwide and greater confidence in healthy travel, there will be more people traveling so plan ahead, remain vigilant and practice kindness."CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPAccording to the TSA website, there are currently 273 TSA employees with active COVID-19 infections. Those employees are "staying home to keep the traveling public safe."The TSA also said that since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the agency cumulatively had 11,171 federal employees test positive for COVID-19—10,898 of those employees recovered, but 32 "unfortunately died after contracting the virus." TSA also said that two screening contractors have also passed away after COVID infections.Fox News' Julia Musto and The Associated Press contributed to this report.Brooke Singman is a Fox News Digital politics reporter.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.Austrianssavored one last mulled wine in packed Christmas markets before the curtain came down on theholidayseason that was just getting underway, plunging the country that gave the world "Silent Night" into its fourth lockdown of this pandemic on Monday.The capital, Vienna, awoke groggily to the new restrictions, with people heading to work, to bring children to school or to exercise outdoors, more or less as usual.This was not the draconian lockdown of thepandemic’sdawn in 2020, when movements were strictly monitored and discouraged. Police cars circulated, in keeping with government promises to step up controls, but no spot checks were being made.PROTESTS ERUPT OVER VIRUS LIMITS IN AUSTRIA, ITALY, CROATIAPeople crowd a Christmas market in Vienna, Austria, Sunday, Nov. 21, 2021.(AP Photo/Vadim Ghirda)"I am particularly annoyed by the lockdown,’’ said Georg Huber, a lawyer on his way to the office. "One should have done more research in, I don’t know, summer? One should have implemented a mandatoryvaccinationin the summer, when it turned out it would not be enough to hope that people get there without any coercion. I think the government just overslept."Austria has one of the lowest vaccination rates in western Europe, coming in at around 66% of the population of 8.9 million people. There is a vocal minority who refuse to be inoculated.The government announced the nationwide lockdown on Friday, as the average daily deaths tripled in recent weeks and hospitals in hard-hit states warned that intensive care units were hitting capacity.The renewed restrictions will be in place for at least 10 days, but are likely to be extended for a further 10, after which the government has indicated plans to open up so Austrians can celebrateChristmasnormally. Restrictions, however, will remain for the unvaccinated.A woman rides a bicycle along an empty street in Vienna, Austria, Monday, Nov. 22, 2021.(AP Photo/Vadim Ghirda)As of Monday, people can leave their homes only for specific reasons, including buying groceries, going to the doctor or exercising. Kindergartens and schools will remain open for those who need them, but all parents were asked to keep their children at home if possible.AUSTRIA TO ENTER LOCKDOWN, BRING IN MANDATORY VACCINATIONSHealth Minister Wolfgang Mueckstein said the lockdown was necessary to bring down the number of new daily infections, which have spiked to as many as 15,000 a day, and to reduce the number of virus patients in intensive care, currently at 531. But most of all, he said, it was needed to bring relief "to the people who work in this sector, the nurses and doctors who cannot take it anymore.""It is a situation where we have to react now. The only way is with a lockdown, a relatively hard method, to lower the numbers with a wooden hammer,’’ Mueckstein told national broadcaster ORF on Sunday night.Political analysts say the government did not effectively communicate the necessity of the vaccinations early enough, and that many Austrians did not take the campaign seriously enough after former Chancellor Sebastian Kurz declared the pandemic "over" last summer. Kurz was forced out in a corruption scandal last month, replaced by his foreign minister, Alexander Schallenberg, who inside of a week expanded the controversial lockdown on the unvaccinated to a lockdown for everyone.PFIZER CEO ‘CONCERNED’ ABOUT A HOLIDAY COVID WAVEA couple poses for a photograph backdropped by the building of the city hall at a Christmas market in Vienna, Austria, Sunday, Nov. 21, 2021.(AP Photo/Vadim Ghirda)Schallenberg also has pledged to make vaccinations mandatory by Feb. 1, with details still to be hammered out. Experts have speculated that it could be limited to certain age groups or even tied to employment, as Italy has done. InItaly, health passes are required to access places of employment, and can be obtained with a negative test good for 48 hours in addition to the vaccination or proof of having recovered from the virus.On the eve of Austria’s latest lockdown, people flocked to Christmas markets for one last night of public socializing, and many spent the weekend getting a leg up on holiday shopping before stores closed. The Austrian Trade Association said sales were up 15% on Saturday, when lines formed to take advantage of "Black Friday" deals, compared with the same day in 2019, before the pandemic.But many feared the last-minute boost would not be enough to salvage the season for businesses that rely on the holiday season.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPSophie Souffle, who sells upcycled jewelry at markets all year round, said she makes most of her money over the six-week Christmas market period. Any promised help from the government will be enough to get by, she said, "but it won’t be enough to invest for future business."She looked around as people trawled stands, eyeing wares more than buying them, and gathering in small groups to enjoy the company of others before gatherings were restricted. She sensed more desperation than holiday spirit."The mood is pre-apocalyptic,’’ she said.Get all the stories you need-to-know from the most powerful name in news delivered first thing every morning to your inboxSubscribedYou've successfully subscribed to this newsletter!This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2022 FOX News Network, LLC.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.Ahead ofChristmas, a towering wooden screen — once blackened with soot from millions of worshippers' candles — is being restored to its gilded glory in the Church of the Nativity, built at the site where many believe Jesus was born.But few visitors are expected to see it during the upcoming Christmas holiday season.Biblical Bethlehem has struggled since the start of the coronavirus pandemic almost two years ago. Christmas is normally peak season for tourism in Jesus' traditional birthplace, located in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. In pre-pandemic times, thousands of pilgrims and tourists from around the world celebrated in the Church of the Nativity and the adjacent Manger Square.POPE FRANCIS BRINGS HOPE TO THE POOR IN ASSISI VISITTourists pose for a photo with renovated polished limestone columns, during a visit to the Church of the Nativity, in the West Bank city of Bethlehem, Tuesday, Nov. 16, 2021.(AP Photo/Nasser Nasser)Israel reopened its borders to vaccinated tourists earlier this month, but relatively few are expected to travel to Bethlehem this holiday season, and not nearly as many as in the record-breaking year preceding the pandemic. Most tourists visiting Bethlehem fly into Israel as the West Bank does not have an airport.Many of Bethlehem’s hotels have shut and shopkeepers have struggled to keep afloat. Aladdin Subuh, a shopkeeper whose store sits just off Manger Square, said he only opens his doors to air out the shop."It’s almost Christmas and there’s nobody. Imagine that," he said, surveying the few passersby in the hopes of spotting a foreigner in search of a souvenir. "For two years, no business. It’s like dying slowly."Though the pandemic has blighted the Holy Land’s once thriving tourism industry for Israelis and Palestinians alike, for tourism-dependent Bethlehem, the impact has been especially severe. Israel, the primary gateway for foreign tourists, had banned most foreign visitors for the past year and half before this month's reopening.Just over 30,000 tourists entered Israel in the first half of November, compared to 421,000 in November 2019, according to Israel’s Interior Ministry.The Palestinian self-rule government which administers autonomous enclaves in the West Bank has only provided limited support, in the form of tax exemptions and training programs, to hoteliers, tour operators and tour guides, said Majed Ishaq, director of marketing at the Palestinian Tourism Ministry. He said the ministry was launching a campaign to encourage Palestinian citizens of Israel to visit Bethlehem and other West Bank cities over the holiday season. He added that he hopes the number of foreign tourists would be 10% to 20% of pre-pandemic figures.Others are not so optimistic."I don’t think tourism will come back very soon," said Fadi Kattan, a Palestinian chef and hotelier in Bethlehem’s Old City. The pandemic forced him to close his Hosh Syrian guesthouse in March 2020, and over the months he had to let his staff go.He said it was neither financially nor practically feasible to reopen ahead of Christmas, particularly in light of a new wave of coronavirus infections sweeping across Europe. He said it will take years to recover the pandemic’s "compounded impact over two years" on Bethlehem’s economy — from hotels and restaurants on down to the farmers, grocers and dry cleaners who depended on their business,"To reopen in security we need to see that there’s a long-term prospect," he said.A section of a renovated mosaic adorns the Church of the Nativity, in the West Bank city of Bethlehem, Thursday, Nov. 11, 2021.(AP Photo/Nasser Nasser)On a recent day at the Church of the Nativity, the crown jewel of Bethlehem, a solitary group of Italian tourists entered the 6th-century basilica that in years before COVID-19 would have a line stretching out the door. Municipal workers were starting to string up Christmas lights behind them in Manger Square.The church has undergone a multi-million dollar facelift since 2013 that was organized by a Palestinian presidential committee. It has restored gold-tiled mosaics and marble floors to their former glory and made major structural repairs to the UNESCO heritage site, one of the oldest churches in Christendom.Additional work remains to be done, said Mazen Karam, director of the Bethlehem Development Foundation, the group spearheading some of the restorations at the church. The undertaking has already cost $17 million, but Karam said an additional $2 million are needed to refurbish the church’s flagstones and install firefighting and micro-climate systems.A separate project by the Greek Orthodox Church to refurbish the once soot-encrusted iconostasis — a late 18th-century wooden screen separating the sanctuary from the building's nave — was delayed by the coronavirus outbreak, but is now nearing completion ahead of Christmas after three years of painstaking work."It's a big challenge," said Saki Pappadopoulos, a woodcarver with Artis, a Greek restoration company leading the project.Palestinian children walk past closed souvenir shops at the tourists market adjacent to the Church of the Nativity, in the West Bank city of Bethlehem, Tuesday, Nov. 16, 2021.(AP Photo/Nasser Nasser)CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPBut Father Issa Thaljieh, a Greek Orthodox priest at the Church of the Nativity, remains optimistic ahead of the holiday season."Thank God, a little bit day by day we can see more groups coming to Bethlehem — not staying in Bethlehem, only maybe for a visit — but it is a good sign," he said, standing on church's recently refinished marble bema, or raised platform.

They also adjusted for potential confounders including sex, race and ethnicity, annual household income, parent educational level and study site.Using Stata statistics and data software, they found that poorer mental health and greater perceived stress were associated with higher total screen use. Alternatively, more social support and coping behaviors were associated with lower total screen use.They also noted that younger age and slightly different screen time categories could account for differences.CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC HAS LED AMERICANS TO SPEND A LOT MORE TIME STARING AT SCREENSOther limitations of the study included the use of self-reported data, and the researchers noted that the computed total of hours could be an overestimate, as adolescents often multitask on screens."Despite the gradual reversal of quarantine restrictions, studies have suggested that screen use may remain persistently elevated. Screen time disparities across racial, ethnic, and income groups in adolescents have been reported previously and may be due to structural and systemic racism–driven factors (eg, built environment, access to financial resources, and digital media education)—all of which have been amplified in the COVID-19 pandemic," the authors wrote.Any future research, they added, should examine screen use trends as pandemic restrictions are lifted and explore methods to prevent sociodemographic disparities.According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), citing the Kaiser Family Foundation, kids aged 8-18 spend an average of 7.5 hours in front of a screen for entertainment purposes.The CDC recommendskids get at least 60 minutes ofphysical activityper day and the agency said that the time kids spend watching TV and playing video games is time during which they could be physically active.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThe American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry recommendsthat parents devise a "screen-time plan" for their children."Positive and healthy screen use is possible with proper guidance and consistency," the academy notes.Stay up-to-date on the biggest health and wellness news with our weekly recap.SubscribedYou've successfully subscribed to this newsletter!This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2022 FOX News Network, LLC.

Anderson, a general surgery resident at Michigan Medicine and the first author of the study,said in a statement. "And it highlights the need for public health interventions around excessive alcohol consumption."CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPAccording to John's Hopkins Medicine, alcoholic hepatitis is inflammation of the liver that leads to liver cell damage and cell death. It is caused by drinking too much alcohol and usually develops over time – though sometimes severe hepatitis can develop suddenly and quickly lead to liver failure and death.Dietary guidelines from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend no more than one drink a day for women and two for men.Excessive alcohol use is responsible for 95,000 deaths in the United States each year,the agency says, including 1 in 10 total deaths among working-age adults.Stay up-to-date on the biggest health and wellness news with our weekly recap.SubscribedYou've successfully subscribed to this newsletter!This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2022 FOX News Network, LLC.

Zoo animals in Oregon chomp down on pumpkins in a top viral video of the day.The Smithsonian's National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute vaccinated several of their primates againstCOVID-19this week, saying it was just the beginning of animal coronavirus inoculations at its locations.The zoo announced in a press release Friday that staff administered the first round of two-dose shots to 11 animals on Wednesday: seven orangutans, a western lowland gorilla, one white-eared titi monkey and two emperor tamarins.Apes wander inside their enclosure Jan. 4, 2018 at the Washington D.C. national zoo.(Andrew Lichtenstein/ Corbis)ATLANTA ZOO TREATING 13 GORILLAS FOR COVID-19A video posted by the zoo noted that the "animals were rewarded with honey for their participation."Thevaccineused was developed specifically for animals by Michigan-based veterinary pharmaceutical company Zoetis after the company saw that a dog in China contracted the virus early in the pandemic.Zoetis said in apress releasein July that its shots were authorized on a "case-by-case basis by the United States Department of Agriculture" for an array of zoo animals, but said the shots are "not needed inpetsor livestock at this time."AUSTRALIAN RESCUE DOGS SHOT OVER COVID RESTRICTIONS: REPORTThe National Zoo also provided a status update on the lions and tigers under its care that had tested "presumptive positive" for COVID-19 last month, saying the big cats were "recovering well" and "behaving, eating and drinking normally.""Vaccines will continue to be administered to select animals identified as susceptible species at the Zoo and at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute in Front Royal, Virginia, in the coming months," the zoo explained, adding that "the lions and tigers will receive the vaccine no sooner than 90 days post-infection."The National Zoo did not immediately respond to Fox News' questions regarding the inoculations.Tigers at the Smithsonian's National Zoo in Washington, DC.(KAREN BLEIER/AFP)Zoos in different parts of thecountryhave increasingly been vaccinating myriad species with the Zoetis vaccine.The Denver Zoo and Oakland Zoo used the jab on some of their animals over the summer, CBS Newsreported, and the Denver Zoo is planning to do the same.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPFOX 35reportedThursday that ZooTampa has also begun vaccinating its animals."Species such as Florida panthers, skunks, otters and primates are on top of the list to vaccinate," Fox 35 reported.

"As bad as these changes have been for all Americans, they disproportionately impact racial and ethnic minorities in the U.S., who already bear a higher disease burden from COVID-19."DEPRESSION, ANXIETY FELL AS US COVID-19 RESTRICTIONS ENDED IN 2021: CDC DATAIn order to reach theseconclusions, the authors conducted a survey called theHealth, Ethnicity, and Pandemic (HEAP) Studyin October 2020 among adults.The HEAP Study was funded by the Center for Reducing Health Disparities at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, The Chinese Economists Society and the Calvin J. Li Memorial Foundation. The study was designed by investigators from several universities and carried out by the National Opinion Research Center (NORC) at the University of Chicago.Participants of the study were selected using 48 sampling criteria, including age, race, ethnicity, education and gender.Those selected – more than 2,700 – were asked to report five lifestyle behaviors before and during the pandemic, including exercise time, screen time,fast-food meal consumption, alcohol drinking and cigarette smoking.A man smokes a cigarette outdoors(iStock)The relation of social and demographic factors with each lifestyle change was estimated using "weighted multivariable logistic regression models."Across those surveyed, the time spent on exercise decreased by more than 31%, screen time increased by more than 60%, alcohol consumption increased by more than 23% and smoking increased by 9%.That said, the average consumption of fast food dropped from 1.41 times per week to 0.96 times per week during the pandemic."The observed decrease in fast food consumption is likely due to the stay-at-home order and the closure of fast-food restaurants during the pandemic," Chen said. "Although the majority of our study’s participants, about 77%, reduced or did not see a change in their fast-food meal consumption, there were still almost 23% that increased how much fast food they ate in the same period."PEOPLE ARE TURNING TO HORSE THERAPY TO IMPROVE MENTAL HEALTH DURING THE PANDEMICThe authors also identified subgroups that were more vulnerable to adverse influences from the pandemic,Compared to Non-Hispanic Whites, Non-Hispanic Blacks and Hispanics were more likely to have undesired changes in multiple lifestyle behaviors, including exercise, screen time, fast food intake and alcohol consumption.American Indians and those in the "other" racial category were more likely to decrease their exercise time and increase consumption of fast-food meals and Asian Americans were less likely to increase alcohol drinking and cigarette smoking.The findings, the authors said, were consistent with those from previous studies that documented the disproportionate exposure to and suffering from the COVID-19 pandemic by these groups.In addition, younger-aged adults were also more likely to have undesired changes in exercise time, consumption of fast-food meals, alcohol drinking and cigarette smoking, compared with old adults.Women had higher odds to increase screen time during the pandemic andmarriedindividuals were not more likely to decrease exercise time than those who were married or lived with partners.Lower odds of smoking during the pandemic were associated with higher household income and individuals with higher education levels had higher odds of having more undesired lifestyle changes including less exercise time, more screen time and more alcohol drinking.Notably, the study has several limitations including that survey data was only collected at the one-time point during the pandemic and that limited information was collected for each lifestyle behavior due to the concerns regarding participant time and burden.Fordietary intake, the researchers solely focused on the consumption of fast-food meals.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPNevertheless, the authors say that mitigating the impacts of COVID-19 requires effective interventions."We found a marked increase in sedentary behaviors, alcohol consumption, and cigarette smoking, and a decline in exercise," Dr. Jian Li, Fielding School professor of environmental health sciences and a co-author, said in the release. "Whether these persisted as the pandemic continued, and whether individual’s quality of life and health well-being are subsequently affected, has to be studied, but it is clear that resources and support that can help people maintain healthy lifestyles, during the pandemic and afterwards, are urgently needed."Stay up-to-date on the biggest health and wellness news with our weekly recap.SubscribedYou've successfully subscribed to this newsletter!This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2022 FOX News Network, LLC.

Among my friends I saw a need. Many of us don’t want to take this. People were being coerced, I believe in freedom and I’m here to support the freedom of my fellow employees and all people across this country. I’m not going to take a mandate, I’m not going to be forced to do something I don’t believe in," he said on "Tucker Carlson Tonight."Yoder warned that if the warning from the past weekend isn't heeded, the effect of thousands of American workers being fired en masse will have devastating and lasting effects on the U.S. economy as well as everyday life for all Americans:"If you have flights reduced by 30% because 30% of pilots are fired because they won’t take the vaccine, this is going to affect how your goods get here from overseas, how they are distributed to the store," he said."The same thing is happening with the truckers, it’s happening in the shipping industry. Those Amazon boxes that typically show up in two days, you might be looking at three weeks."In that regard, host Tucker Carlson said this entire situation would've been avoidable had it not been for a "purge overseen by Susan Rice" of unvaccinated Americans: "[It] ha[s] nothing whatsoever to do with public health and everything to do with the accumulation of political power."While Biden continues to act as if he has all of the power in this equation, Yoder said the opposite is true, as evidenced by the alleged mass sick-outs or walkouts."First of all, we have all the control, and the control comes from a simple word, and that is ‘no’," he said. "We just don’t need to comply.""As far as I’m concerned I will never promote a sick-out or a work action that is illegal. With U.S. Freedom Flyers, the organization I'm with, we will never promote such a thing. With that being said, we also cannot control the actions of individuals. And I think that you will see massive disruptions in supply chain and in your travel if we just stand up and say no."If these companies fire us and they fire 30% of the workforce, aircraft are going to stop moving and it’s going to affect you. It’s going to affect your air travel and it’s going to affect the economy."Carlson noted Biden's habit to date is to criticize and target Americans who do not comply with his personal wishes – pointing to a recent speech alongside Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker in which Biden attacked "the unvaccinated" as risking economic and medical turmoil."The unvaccinated patients are leaving no room for someone with a heart attack or in need of a cancer operation and so much more because they can’t into the ICU.  They can’t get into the operating rooms," Biden claimed."The unvaccinated also put our economy at risk because people are reluctant to go out," Biden added, with Carlson commenting that no American president has ever spoken like this about his own people.CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPCarlson went on to ask Yoder what he will think when Biden potentially blames him or others like him for the multifaceted repercussions of the walkouts if they were multiplied."It's his fault," replied Yoder. "It is squarely his fault.""I think anyone with a critical mind can point towards the federal government of the companies that are enforcing these illegal mandates from the federal government and see that it’s the federal government’s fault."Charles Creitz is a reporter for Fox News Digital.Get all the stories you need-to-know from the most powerful name in news delivered first thing every morning to your inboxSubscribedYou've successfully subscribed to this newsletter!This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2022 FOX News Network, LLC.

And the horses are the ones that bring them back there."According to The Academy for Coaching with Horses, anotherorganizationwhich offers the same program, horse therapy helps people build leadership and self-awareness skills through horse-human interactions.The interactions allow individuals to "identify and shift the limiting behavior patterns that prohibit them from developing trusting relationships in business settings," according to its website.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPOne of Niederberghaus’ clients, Sienna Nelson, came to the program while she was struggling with insecurities related to a skin condition she suffered from."I wasn't even really going outside," Nelson told Fox.

Most Americans have never been there. It’s an awfully long way away. But when Americans think of Australia, they imagine a freer, tougher version of themselves. Steve Irwin, Crocodile Dundee, that kind of thing. So there’s a huge reserve of affection in the United States for Australia, its culture, and its people. It’s also possible most Americans, us included, have not updated our assumptions about Australia in a while. The modern reality is a little different from what we imagine.Case and point: In June of 2019, federal police in Sydney, Australia raided the offices of the state broadcaster, ABC. They weren’t at all unclear about why they were raiding the offices. They said it out loud. Just days before the raid, ABC broadcast allegations from a whistleblower that embarrassed Australia's government. This whistleblower said that Australia's military leaders had killed civilians inAfghanistan, including children, and had lied about it. ABC broadcast that story.It wasn’t a crime to broadcast the story, and Australia’s federal police didn’t pretend it was. Instead, they served ABC with a warrant that authorized them, the police, to cover up the evidence of the military's misconduct. The warrant, and we're quoting, allowed police to "add, copy, delete, or alter" any material they wanted to alter on the broadcaster's computers.That’s not the kind of thing that happens in a free country, to put it mildly. And yet, Australia's military and police forces never suffered any consequences for doing it; In fact, many Australians supported it. They rewarded their military with hundreds of millions of dollars in new spending -- most of that money was intended to keep Australians safe from the malign influence of "Chinese authoritarianism," even though that seemed a lot like Chinese authoritarianism itself.MEDIA STOPS COVERING FL COVID DATA BECAUSE DESANTIS' DOWNTREND THREATENS LOCKDOWN POLITICS: SEXTON, TRAVISTwo years later, what does Australia look like? It looks a lot like China did at the beginning of the pandemic. We showed you those images fromChinaat the time -- the people being welded inside their apartments to starve, the guys in hazmat suits forcing people in quarantine boxes and driving away to some unknown destination. At the time, our public health officials, includingTony Fauci, told us nothing like that could ever happen in our country or in the west. But that was wrong because those things are now happening in Australia. This is what happens in Australia if you try to leave your apartment:REPORTER: Anthony Karam knows he’s COVID positive when he steps into this public lift. Already breaking so many rules, he doesn’t bother to cover his mouth as he sneezes and splutters. The 27-year-old is still infectious but has gone missing from his Wentworth Point apartment, the warrant now issued for his arrest.HEALTH MINISTER BRAD HASSARD: This 27-year-old chap who apparently has expressed the view that he doesn’t care less whether he spreads the virus is one example of the worst of the worst.So a national manhunt for a man who sneezed in an elevator. That’s the state of play in modern-day Australia. Not everyone in the country is on board with this, but since Australians were completely disarmed by their government several years ago, there’s precisely nothing they can do about it, so it’s accelerating. Look at what’s happening now. They’re being crushed. The scene in Melbourne (the second-most populous city in Australia) over the past month was chaos.Is the government cracking down on Islamic extremists, dangerous revolutionaries in their midst? No. Just ordinary Australians complaining, demonstrating peacefully against the lockdowns, beaten bypolice.You've seen a lot of footage from Australia that shows the chaos, but something that's not immediately obvious from the American vantage is this is not all of Australia. The whole country is not locked down. In Australia, most of the lockdowns are in the eastern part of the country, that’s where the capital of the country is and where the federal government has the most control. Western Australia, home to most of the country's national resources, isn't locked down at all. 50,000 fans just crowded inside a stadium for a rugby match in Perth, the capital of Western Australia; no one beat them with nightsticks or hosed by the police. The rugby match was not a super-spreader event. Western Australia has virtually noCOVIDcases.POLITICO REPORTER SCOLDS GOLD STAR FAMILY OF MARINE KILLED FROM KABUL ATTACK FOR NOT WEARING MASKS IN CAPITOLHow did that happen? How does Western Australia not lockdown but remain virtually COVID-free? Simple. By controlling its borders. Western Australia didn't allow thousands of people to stream in from anywhere they wanted to in the world. They’re not Texas. They didn’t care about protecting their borders. They’re not worried about being called racist. It seemed common sense, and it worked.And here's the really revealing thing. Australia's federal government is angry that Western Australia has closed its borders. They want that part of the country to open its borders. Why might that be? According to ABC News, Australia's government is, "arguing that [Western Australia's] internal border restrictions are a drag on the national economy."That’s interesting because the problem with Australia's economy does not come from Western Australia closing its borders. It comes from the lockdowns. Those are the biggest drag on the national economy ever conceived in Australia. So are those police SWAT teams beating people for going outside.COVID mandates are a far greater threat to Australia’s economy and its social fabric than COVID itself. The Queensland health minister, in eastern Australia, explaining that outdoor mask mandates are necessary because of two new COVID cases. Not two thousand, but two:QUEENSLAND HEALTH MINISTER YVETTE D'ATH: What these two cases mean is that we will be extending immediately the directive in relation to mask-wearing to the Gold Coast.We want to pause for a moment to give you a sense of the scope of the pandemic in Australia: To date, COVID has caused 1,300 "recorded deaths" in the entire country. Australia has 25 million people. That 1,300 figure includes people who "died with probable COVID," whatever that means.In Alberta, Canada, the health minister just announced that anyone who stays home from any illness will be counted by the Canadian government as a COVID patient. Then she pretended she didn't say that because it’s obviously insane, but it’s on video, so we know she did.In Australia, the government has adopted a similar standard -- anyone who leaves home is apparently being counted as a COVID patient. A man in Melbourne on Sunday made the mistake of walking outside a block from his home:WOMAN: He lives a block away!POLICE OFFICER: He has no reason to be here. He has no valid reason to be out today.  He wasn’t wearing a face mask.WOMAN: He has a face mask in his pocket. He was just smoking a cigarette. He just came to get lunch with me.MAN: And the reason I didn’t have a mask on was I was having a cigarette. I have two masks in my pocket. What do you want me to do?Here’s the interesting thing – apart from that’s obvious authoritarianism, it’s terrifying that could happen in a civilized English-speaking country, Australia of all places – notice the police didn’t ask the man if he’s been vaccinated. You think that’d be the first question they’d ask. Vaccination works, doesn’t it? That’s why it’s mandatory, right?REP. CHIP ROY INTRODUCES LEGISLATION TO BLOCK FINES FOR BIDEN'S VACCINE MANDATEThat's an important point because publicly, Australia's leaders are still pretending vaccination status matters. In New South Wales -- again, Eastern Australia -- one official promised that the unvaccinated will be allowed to retain their freedoms:DEPUTY PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH WALES JOHN BARILARO: The message to the unvaccinated is that you will not achieve any further freedom unless you get vaccinated and finally my message to south wales … There will be individuals in South Wales who choose not to be vaccinated who will lose their freedoms on the 11th of October.No more freedom if you don’t get the vax, but, they will arrest you for being outside smoking a cigarette a block from your home without a mask, and not even ask you whether they’ve been vaccinated. So if vaccination status is that important as a health matter, wouldn’t that be the first question you ask? But they didn’t even bother.Meanwhile, in the same state -- New South Wales -- Australian officials are telling people that whether they're vaccinated or not, they can't go tochurch:PASTOR: In the name of Jesus, lockdowns are over, in the cities of New South Wales.REPORTER: It’s unclear what passage this pastor is preaching from, but it’s not the public health order. His church the Christ Embassy in Blacktown is in lockdown, hard lockdown. … There was no QR code on the door. Costing the organization 5,000 dollars. Each of these thirty adult worshipers fined a thousand dollars.POLICE OFFICER: Whether it’s a soccer match, whether it’s a church service, it doesn’t matter. You cannot gather as they did at Blacktown.Oh, so you have to get vaccinated to get any of your freedoms, but even if you are vaccinated, you’re not allowed to go to church. So what is the point of vaccination? Why did the federal government in Australia lock everyone down if there’s no actual way to stop the lockdowns. And more to the point, why do they want open borders in Western Australia if closing the borders has actually kept the population safe.COVID CASES SPIKE IN AUSTRALIAN STATE OF VICTORIA, GOVERNMENT BLAMES PEOPLE WATCHING SPORTS AT HOMEThey want open borders there for the same reason they want them here. In New South Wales, one official -- the health officer -- made it explicit:DR. KERRY CHANT: We will be looking at what contact tracing looks like in the new world order. Yes, it will be pubs and clubs and other things if we have a positive case there.The new world order. She said it out loud. This is a really interesting story, what’s happening in Australia, and what it means for the rest of the Anglosphere, very much including us. And maybe that’s why globally, most media organizations have refused to cover it. That comment barely got any coverage at all. In fact, all the footage we just quoted is mostly being ignored in the United States.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPWhy? It’s possible what’s happening in Australia might be instructive to us in the United States. In just two years, Australia's police went from raiding newsrooms to beating people in the street. Maybe the lesson is: Things can change very quickly. One moment, the English-speaking world is mocking China for being dystopian and autocratic.The next moment, they’re aping China and hunting people down who are two blocks from their home and smoking a cigarette.This article is adapted from Tucker Carlson's opening commentary on the Sept. 30, 2021 edition of "Tucker Carlson Tonight."Get the recap of top opinion commentary and original content throughout the week.SubscribedYou've successfully subscribed to this newsletter!This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2022 FOX News Network, LLC.

"Every March I start to get e-mails from people asking, ‘Where is the drug? Can I be in a trial?’"The publication said Hage's team, which has licensed the compound, passed initial safety testing in human beings and is about to be evaluated in aclinical trial.Scientific American also wrote about progress in different studies on rashes from urushiol, the oil from the sap of the plants.Poison Ivy plants growing on the ground(iStock)As many as 50 million Americans are impacted by poison ivy or its cousins poison oak and poison sumac every year,according to the American Skin Association, with about 85% of the populationallergicto the plants and around 10% to 15% extremely allergic.The three plants grow everywhere in the U.S. with the exception of Hawaii, Alaska and some Nevada deserts.The plants – with three leaves, five, seven, nine, or appearing asvines or shrubs– cause allergic contact dermatitis from urushiol that can be carried on animals, tools and other objects.NATURAL WAYS TO TREAT POISON IVY, OTHER RASHESReaction to urushiol includes redness,swelling, blisters and severe itching and the rash takes approximately two weeks to heal, the association said, provided infection with bacteria does not occur.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says thatanyone who is outdoorsis at risk for exposure.The agency saidthat recognition of the plants is an important step to avoiding them in addition to washing garden tools and gloves, wearing long sleeves and long pants, washing pets and washing skin in soap and cool water as soon as possible if in contact with a poisonous plant.Poison rashes aren't contagious but the plant oil can linger for years on virtually every surface until it has been washed with water or rubbing alcohol.While prevention is the best cure, there aremethods for treatmentand the CDC recommends soaking in cool water or a lukewarm oatmeal bath, applying over-the-counter topical corticosteroid preparations or taking prescription oral corticosteroids, applying topical over-the-counter skin protectants including calamine lotion and avoiding scratching.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPAn antihistamine may help to relieve the itching, the CDC said, adding that people should seek medical attention if they have a temperature over 100 degrees Fahrenheit, there is pus or soft yellow scabs on the rash, the itching gets worse, they have difficulty breathing and the rash spreads to eyes, mouth, genital area or more than one-fourth of the skin.Stay up-to-date on the biggest health and wellness news with our weekly recap.SubscribedYou've successfully subscribed to this newsletter!This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2022 FOX News Network, LLC.

That’s up from May 2020, when 46% of parents felt the same way.Many parents do believe their children will be able to make up lost progress, however, according to the survey. Ipsos found 67% of parents said their children "will eventually be able to make up any lost ground," while 22% said their children would not be able to.HOW TO ROAD TRIP WITH KIDS, FROM PARENTS WHO LIVE IN A BUS YEAR-ROUNDSome parents who are particularly worried about their children falling behind have evenheld their children back a year. Parents and guardians who previously spoke with Fox News said their children struggled to keep up with virtual learning.To help, those parents transferred their children to private and charter schools, which were meeting in person or had a more hands-on virtual curriculum.Previous studies have confirmed some parents' fears when it came to virtual learning challenges.ADecember report from McKinsey & Companyestimated that students fell behind an average of three months on math and one and a half months on reading in 2020.

However, visitation fell nearly 30% to 237 million in 2020 during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic.NATIONAL PARKS TO BEGIN ROLLING BACK RESERVATION REQUIREMENTS"If we look back at 2019, there were 327 million who visited America's more than 400 national parks, and those visitors contributed over $41 billion to the U.S. economy, so we're expecting an even bigger impact through 2021," Anzelmo-Sarles said.As visitors return, a few parks have already broken monthly visitation records. This July, for the first time ever, Yellowstone National Park saw more than 1 million visitors in a singe month — a 15% increase from 2019.(Yellowstone National Park)At the same time, increased visitation has also led to long lines at entry points, overrun attractions and some visitors being turned away."That visitation is concentrated in our most popular 12 to 15 destination national parks, places like Yellowstone, Grand Teton, Glacier, Rocky Mountain, and Acadia and Shenandoah," Anzelmo-Sarles said. "But we do see congestion in parks across the country."BEST CAMPGROUNDS ACROSS THE USIn July, national parkovercrowdingwas so significant, it became the focus of a U.S. Senate hearing."We must recognize that overcrowding in the parks itself can degrade the national resources these units are designed to protect.

The Transportation Security announced in August that flyers who break mask mandates can be fined from $250 to $1,500.Meanwhile, when reached by The Post for comment, a spokesman for Spirit Airlines said the viral video is "unverified" but not surprising given the thirsty nature of social media."This account often falsely attributes photos and videos to Spirit Airlines," the rep told The Post. "The video could have been taken at any time or any place and it has no identifying characteristic of any airline. I checked, and we have no record of this on file."But if shewereflying the airline, Spirit’s contract of carriage states that passengers may be prevented from boarding an airplane or even kicked off if they are "barefoot or inadequately clothed" or sport clothing that "is lewd, obscene, or offensive in nature."SPIRIT AIRLINES PASSENGER WHO SMOKED CIGARETTE ON PLANE ESCOTED OFF BY POLICE: VIDEOIn the past, people have been penalized for much similar fashion infractions, including a Playboy model who was told her she couldn’t fly on a Southwest Airlines flight while wearing her low-cut leopard print top.It’s yet unclear if bikini-clad bombshell had actually boarded an airplane — Spirit or otherwise — in that outfit.Needless to say, her security checkpoint striptease made waves on Instagram with one commenter quipping "at least she has her mask on."CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPAnother slavering viewer wrote, "If more spirit pax looked like this I’d fly on them more.""Security should [be a] breeze," said another, bringing to mind another instance in which a woman donned a black bikini at Los Angeles International Airport to help expedite the screening process.Clickhereto read more on theNew York Post.Get all the stories you need-to-know from the most powerful name in news delivered first thing every morning to your inboxSubscribedYou've successfully subscribed to this newsletter!This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2022 FOX News Network, LLC.

Her 2-year-old daughter, Drew, was crying and would not keep on her mask, Cleek told FOX News."Drew is a thumb sucker and her only way she biologically knows how to soothe herself is by sucking her thumb which is damn near impossible with a mask," Cleek posted to Instagram after the incident.Cleek and her husband held Drew down, she said, trying to get her to wear her mask while two flight attendants stood over them, watching.What happened next, Cleek wrote on Instagram after the incident, had her "still shaking."Cleek said she was given two options. Cut a hole in the mask, she said she was told sarcastically, or "glue it to her face." The flight attendant, Cleek said, indicated she had glue available.A post shared by Ali Cleek (@agcleek)The mom of two said she is a "rule follower" and doesn't want to come across as anti-mask."I just know that regardless if it was sarcasm or not I was embarrassed and trying to follow the mandate as much as I could," Cleek said. "My daughter is 2. We were doing everything we could to comply."In her post, she wrote "I don’t like being this person. Wearing a mask is the federal mandate… I get it. I respect it. But at some point we have to have human decency.

"They said they would essentially talk to the flight crew," she said.Beyond the apology, Cleek said she hopes there's been communication around the company about what to do in similar situations."I know I never want another parent to be in tears on an airplane because their 2-year-old won't wear a mask. I really don't want parents to feel like they have to hold down their child to put on a mask.

She was five months pregnant with her first child, she said."I tried to be optimistic about it," Hazelton said. "I went on some moms’ [social media] groups, saw what others went through, so I thought I would be OK.""I was scared," she added. "But once my temperature started to get out of control, that’s when I started to get worried."(Kassidy Hazelton)Hazelton said she experienced symptoms of body aches, progressed fever and cough, which worsened over time.Hazelton suspects she may have contracted COVID-19 after visiting a "lax" car dealership to purchase a vehicle. Because she was pregnant, Hazelton said, she was hesitant to get vaccinated.Hazelton said she quarantined and at one point her body temperature rose to 103 degrees. Her partner, Craig, tested positive and was asymptomatic.Banner Desert Medical Center in Mesa air-transported Hazelton to Banner University Medical Center after she was placed in an induced coma, Hazelton said."I had double pneumonia and a fungal infection so they had discussed a lung transplant," Hazelton said."I was not improving at all and my family made a decision to deliver [my son], as the doctor suggested, to give us the best surviving chance," she said.Hazelton said she and doctors believed she likely had the fungal infection in her lungs prior to COVID-19, which became more serious when she contracted the virus.(Kassidy Hazelton)On May 31, Memorial Day, Hazelton’s son Kash was born weighing 2 pounds, 2 ounces.Kash was immediately brought to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU)."Once I was coherent, I thought I was still pregnant," Hazelton said of coming off medical drugs. "They told me he was delivered and that I couldn’t get out of bed, so some family [members] had to press me down and say, ‘No.’"Kash, who was born via C-section, will remain in the NICU until at least his original due date, which was Aug. 20, Hazelton said, adding that three nurses wheeled her hospital bed into the unit so she could see him for the first time.Kash has had blood transfusions and has had heart murmurs. His breathing is consistently being monitored due to his premature birth.Hazelton, who was hospitalized for about seven weeks, still has shortness of breath and is currently undergoing counseling to help process her experience."Every single nurse, all the OB doctors, my main primary physician, they were blown away of how fast I was recovering," Hazelton said of her care team at Banner Health. "They could not comprehend how I was able to walk and do all these things ... they said I was very lucky to be alive and we were ‘miracles,’ is what they said to me.’"Banner Health told Fox News that it’s "thankful for the life-saving care" in which the "exceptional medical team provided to Kassidy and her baby, Kash.""Data have shown that COVID-19 infection puts pregnant people at increased risk of severe complications and even death, according to the CDC," a spokesperson added. "Pregnant women should consider receiving the COVID-19 vaccination for the safety of themselves, their infant, their loved ones and others. This isa recommendationfrom the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine."(Kassidy Hazelton)Hazelton echoed that statement."I usually think it’s crazy to put all these protectants on but at this point where the virus is, wear a shield, wear a mask, be that person," she said. "Don’t ignore this virus even though they’re saying it's slowing down. It was slowing down in our state and I forgot it.""Mothers need to take this seriously and there were mothers that did not make it … protect yourself and your baby because it can, and it will kill you," she added. "It tried to kill me. I went on my platform and said, "I was wrong. This is real,’ and I am all for admitting that I was wrong."Hazelton has launched a GoFundMe account titled, "Healing from COVID-19, coma and the birth of Kash."Donations will help recover from business losses amid the spread of the virus, as well as Kash’s homecoming, she said.Hazelton said Kash is a clone of his father and has inherited her personality."You can tell he has that fire in him that I have, which is great because he needs that right now," she added.Nicole Pelletiere is senior lifestyle editor for Fox News Digital.Parallels of the Ark: How Noah's Journey Symbolizes JesusParallels of the Ark: How Noah's Journey Symbolizes JesusFun stories about food, relationships, the great outdoors and more.SubscribedYou've successfully subscribed to this newsletter!This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2022 FOX News Network, LLC.

The school's director, Jean Lomino, tells Fox News all classes will be conducted outside at a family farm in Chattanooga, Tenn.(Nature Kin Farm and Forest School)"The school is located on the 50-acre, Rowell family farm at Lookout Lake that includes wetlands, creek, forests, meadows and a lake, making it an ideal outdoor classroom/STEM laboratory," Lomino, who is the school’s director, told FOX News via email.She went on, "The forest school philosophy is based on the fact that nature provides the context for all learning and provides meaningful, holistic, and real-life experiences."So far, the Nature Kin Farm and Forest School has 10 to 12 full-day students enrolled. Lomino said the school has an "equal number" of half-day students who are enrolled in programs for kids between ages 9 and 11 and 12 and 17.BACK TO SCHOOL ANXIETY: START PREPPING KIDS FOR RETURN TO IN-PERSON LEARNING WEEKS IN ADVANCE, EXPERTS SAYAll classes will be conducted outdoors with an exception of a few cooking classes and any "other pursuit" that might require an indoor setting.According to Lomino, enrolled students will engage in "engage in outdoor learning in all weather conditions, throughout all four seasons."Lomino added, "In my teaching experiences over my 50-year career, I know that children are more focused, more responsive and joyful when they learn in nature. I believe that occurs because there are no walls around them and no ceiling above. Their spirits soar. They are more observant, creative, curious and ready to learn."LOS ANGELES SCHOOLS TO REQUIRE COVID-19 TESTING FOR ALL STUDENTS AND FACULTY, REGARDLESS OF VACCINATION STATUSAlthough some schools throughout the U.S. have become accustomed to outdoor learning as a temporary measure during the coronavirus pandemic, Lomino told Fox News the Nature Kin Farm and Forest School takes inspiration from the "forest school philosophy" that sprouted in northern Europe more than 70 years ago.Danish teacher Ella Flautau is credited with creating the world’s first known forest school in the early 1950s with her "walking kindergarten" class, according to theForest School Foundation, a nonprofit dedicated to the learning method.Aside from offering physical, cognitive and social benefits, Lomino believes forest schools are growing in popularity due to COVID-19.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP"The pandemic created a surge of interest because school could no longer exist as it always has," Lomino said. "Being inside a classroom was not a safe place to be, but taking children outside was a safer place to be."She went on, "As teachers, parents and administrators began to see the many benefits of this kind of learning experience for children, more and more schools adopted an outdoor education model."Lomino thinks the outdoor learning trend will continue to grow as time goes on. At this time, she’s searching for partners who can help fund after-school programs and scholarships for children in underserved communities.CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTERPrior to starting the Nature Kin Farm and Forest School, Lomino co-founded the Wauhatchie School in 2015, which is another nature-immersive school in Chattanooga.She served as the school’s director until she began the Nature Kin Farm and Forest School and a forest school teacher training program known as the Forest School Teacher Institute.FOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS"Literally and figuratively, we must let children burrow down into the earth—find their roots—and then, nourished by open sky and a friendship with nature, they can grow into healthy, happy, whole human beings," Lomino said.

Multiple airlines have delayed or canceled hundreds of flights nationwide at the height of the Christmas travel season.Individuals who are infected may now isolate for just five days if they're asymptomatic, followed by five days of wearing a mask when around other people.In addition, only people who have received abooster shotare exempted from quarantine after being exposed to COVID-19.For everyone else – including people who are six months out from their second mRNA dose or two months out from the Johnson & Johnson vaccine – a five-day quarantine period is now recommended instead of 10 days.At Logan Airport, travelers lined up for coronavirus COVID-19 testing in Boston on Dec. 20, 2021.

Ron DeSantis, R-Fla., as cases of the omicron variant forCOVID-19rise nationwide.Gelber appeared on "New Day" Monday with fill-in host John Avlon to discuss the rising case numbers inFlorida.MIAMI HERALD OP-ED SUGGESTS FLORIDA OMICRON OUTBREAK OCCURRED BECAUSE GOV. DESANTIS ACTED ‘SELFISHLY’Florida Governor Ron DeSantis welcomes Fox Nation Patriot Awards to the sunshine stateGelber was quick to once again accuse DeSantis and other state leaders of discouraging vaccinations as the cases rose."Well, as most people know, our state leaders have been more interested really in stopping people from having to get the vaccine than they have in urging them to get it. So there’s very little we can do," Gelber lamented."There’s not a whole lot we can do in Florida because the legislature and governor have outlawed vaccine mandates and outlawed even mask mandates in certain areas by government and elsewhere," he later added.Avlon pressed further, "Do you think then that Gov. DeSantis has effectively made this pandemic worse in the state of Florida and in your city?""There’s no question that by deciding that, you know, we’re trying to get herd immunity by letting the herd catch the virus has just lengthened the virus. It allowed these variants to sort of come back. I don’t think there’s any question that Florida has handled it poorly," Gelber responded.FILE - Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis speaks at the opening of a monoclonal antibody site Wednesday, Aug. 18, 2021, in Pembroke Pines, Fla. (AP Photo/Marta Lavandier)(AP Photo/Marta Lavandier)CNNanchorshave frequently criticized DeSantis for COVID-19 outbreaks. In August, CNN reporter Jim Acosta evensuggestedlabeling a new variant the "DeSantis variant" after DeSantis refused to promote mask mandates or other restrictions.This contrasted reports of New York state setting a single-day positive COVID case record with nearly 22,000 positives in one day one week prior. Acostareportedon the rising case numbers but avoided throwing blame at any state leaders in the same manner he took with DeSantis.By contrast, Gelber went so far as to suggest that the Florida governor "champions" not taking the vaccine to make a political statement."But right now when it comes to this, for whatever reason, our governor and legislature have decided that they’re going to champion not taking the [vaccine] rather than urging people to take the [vaccine]," Gelber said. "And that’s sort of nuts to me because, you know, that’s the golden ticket out of this, and for some reason, we’ve made it a political statement when frankly we require vaccines of children in schools. We do a whole lot of things to tell people they’ve got to protect themselves and others, but for some reason, this has become a political statement. And there’s no question that making it a political statement is killing people and making them sicker."MALLIOTAKIS: PEOPLE HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF THE GOVERNMENT OVERREACH DURING THE PANDEMICAerial flight Miami Beach waves and surfboarders(iStock)The Miami Herald similarly blamed DeSantis on Friday for acting "selfishly" regarding the omicron variant and "peddling treatment over prevention.""Omicron is what happens when we act selfishly and reject that we’re interconnected with the rest of the world in our common humanity," columnist Fabiola Santiago wrote. "The me, me, me attitude only heightens our vulnerability to disease."Avlon closed the segment saying, "Worst thing we can do. And Florida’s suffering more deaths from COVID than the Americans who died from the Vietnam War. It’s an ongoing tragedy."Fox News’ Cortney O’Brien and Angelica Stabile contributed to this report.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPLindsay Kornick is an associate editor for Fox News Digital.

The president responded that it wasn’t, adding "COVID is spreading so rapidly, if you notice, it just happened almost overnight in the last month."Beyond being incorrect, it betrays a myopic view that the administration has of the country. Some states matter and some do not.TRUMP ‘VERY APPRECIATIVE’ AND ‘SURPRISED’ BIDEN ACKNOWLEDGED HIS ADMINISTRATION'S COVID VACCINE SUCCESSU.S. President Joe Biden listens to a question as he speaks about the country's fight against the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) at the White House in Washington, U.S., December 21, 2021. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque(Reuters)COVID has had a fairly predictable seasonal path. I’m not an epidemiologist or scientist, but I spent the fall monthspredictinga spike would soon come to New York. The COVID case numbers in September 2021 were matching pretty closely to the numbers in September of 2020.So were the numbers in October and November. It wasn’t a tough call. So the idea that the Biden administration and top health officials were surprised by the omicron variant makes no sense. They should have known a seasonal spike was coming whether a new variant was introduced or not.That they ignored that possibility is due to the fact that they believed COVID could be contained through behavioral changes. The south had its seasonal spike in the summer and fall. The Biden administration spent a lot of time criticizing governors like Florida’s Ron DeSantis for their high case count.No such criticism is forthcoming for governors like New York’s Kathy Hochul, Pennsylvania’s Tom Wolf, New Jersey’s Phil Murphy or Maine’s Janet Mills—all Democrat leaders of states currently experiencing a spike in COVID cases.CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTEREarlier this month, White House press secretary Jen Psaki was asked why other countries were getting rapid tests into the hands of their citizens—quickly and at a low cost—but the Biden administration wasn’t able to pull off the same.

Now it appears that’s the administration will do exactly that.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThe administration didn’t move to do that when it was "bad" southern states having spikes. It was a silly idea to get tests into homes until COVID started circulating in the "good" blue states again. The administration can’t continue to politicize the virus as it has. The Biden administration has to represent all of the states, even the ones it openly disdains.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM KAROL MARKOWICZKarol Markowicz is a columnist at the New York Post.

But we need even more, and sooner than January. We need them now.Unfortunately, the president continued his divisive rhetoric of reassuring the vaccinated while issuing dire warnings to the unvaccinated. This approach hasn’t worked before, and it won’t work now.It would be better if the president focused on the positive news that boosters still largely protect you from omicron, while finally acknowledging that recovery from previous infection provides useful immunity to keep omicron from being too severe. Dr. Wassila Jassat, head of the DATCOV hospital surveillance for COVID-19 at the National institute for Communicable Diseases in Johannesburg, South Africa, told me on Doctor Radio on SiriusXM Tuesday that she believes it is this combination of immune factors that has slowed down the current outbreak in South Africa and helped keep it mostly mild.Lacking in the president’s announcement were some practical steps – tools to calm our fears. Vaccines are still not available in most doctors' offices, where physicians could discuss the plusses and minuses with patients. The White House is still not extending the Operation Warp Speed approach to pre-purchasing of targeted boosters for emerging variants.At the same time, as hysteria runs high, almost everyone who tests positive is looking for the Regeneron or Lilly monoclonal antibodies. But those are scarce and have limited effectiveness against the omicron variant. Whereas, GSK’s sotrovimab is effective against omicron and should be mass-produced. Yet the federal government has only purchased 50,000 doses. This effort needs to be ramped up immediately to millions.And probably the greatest omission of all involves Pfizer’s new anti-viral drug, Paxlovid, which is effective against all the variants and can be combined with rapid testing to markedly decrease risk of hospitalization. Yet the drug remains stalled at the FDA, still awaiting Emergency Use Authorization. The government has pre-purchased 10 million treatment courses, but needs to buy 10 times this to make an immediate impact.The president’s rhetoric still involves too much anger – pitting the vaccinated against the unvaccinated. Don’t get me wrong: the vaccines work, and everyone needs to take them.CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTERBut the politics of divisiveness and marginalization don’t work.

Joe Manchin over his decision on Biden’s spending agenda on ‘Fox News Sunday’.Last Sunday, America's media suffered a tragic loss.No, CNN didn't lose its viewer.It happened on "Fox News Sunday."SEN. JOE MANCHIN: If I can't go home and explain it to the people of West Virginia, I can't vote for it, and I cannot vote to continue with this piece of legislation. I just can't. I've tried everything humanly possible. I can't get there.BRET BAIER: You're done. This is a "no."MANCHIN: This is a "no."Wow — that was pretty good, huh? Who knew it took Chris Wallace to leave before the Sunday show breaks actual news.I kid to Chris — we're very close.He went off to something that's called CNN+. Good luck, Chris, but one tip: Avoid "Bring Your Children to Work Day" — for their sake. As you know, there are a lot of perverts over there.There's deep sadness for the press who invested so much in a different outcome.It's like leaving a bunch of Christmas presents in your car only to find out that while you were in the mall getting a pretzel, somebody broke into your car and stole them all.JONATHAN KARL: Sen. Manchin has just said that he is a firm "no" on this legislation.DAVID GREGORY: Manchin is a mercurial person to be dealing with from people I've talked to within the White House. We know this to be true. He may want to be a king-maker in some ways when it comes to this legislation.MSNBC GUEST: This is Joe Manchin wanting to extend "The Joe Manchin Show" — period.MANCHIN A REPUBLICAN?

When Biden ran for office, he had to clear a very low bar — a return to normalcy is what he called it. He pushed that bit of business, and then he returned to the basement and curled up in a doggie basket next to an old Bowflex machine. Everybody has one.Normalcy meant his resting heart rate of zero — that yeah, after four years of wearing the leather jacket of Donald Trump, it was time for America to put on that fuzzy, warm cardigan that was old Joe — except it turned out that type of cardigan was made out of a type of wool that everybody's allergic to, and even moths couldn't stomach the taste.With soaring inflation and escalating crime waves still denied by the Democrats, and a pandemic panic worsened by a befuddled president, a new poll finds that 70% of voters call this a bad year, with over half saying it was awful for them personally, and that doesn't even include the Cuomo brothers or Alec Baldwin.Of course thatpoll is from Fox News, so you know it's gauging how the voters feel, and not the politicians or the media — and it shows yet another record low for Biden.So how's that for normalcy?Others in the media don't look at it this way. They don't ask you about it. When they see that you're suffering, they frame it as: "How does it affect the party we support?" That's why they ignored the crime wave — because it was bad news for them, even though it was bad news for everyone, including you.Politico worries that Democrats will lose one if not both houses of Congress in the midterms while average Americans worry they'll lose their real houses if the economy tanks.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPIt says everything that the media mourns a bill that would have taken inflation to new heights because it meant their party lost. Everything is how it will affect their party — their bottom line. Meanwhile, America didn't expect much or even ask for much — just a little bit of order, of comfort — a smidgen of optimism.Instead,we got everything royally effed up. We were promised a comfy bathrobe and we got a onesie made of steel wool.Sounds kind of good at this point.This article is adapted from Greg Gutfeld's opening monologue on the Dec. 21, 2021, edition of "Gutfeld!"Greg Gutfeld currently serves as host of FOX News Channel's (FNC) "Gutfeld!"

(AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall)As we enter the third calendar year facing another virulent virus, and Omicron’s incredibly rapid spread quickly threatening to overwhelm our already beleaguered health care system, we would be wise to adopt Washington’s mindset.COVID-19is still killing well over 1,000 Americans every day; we cannot accept this as a ‘new normal.’ Instead, we must summon the full weight of our scientific prowess and economic power to save lives, significantly reduce severe disease, and keep our families and communities as safe as possible.We have come far since the pandemic’s early days. Thanks to Republican and Democrat administrations, more than 200 million Americans are fully vaccinated. We have distributed approximately 320 million vaccine doses globally. More than 99 percent of students in America are back in classrooms. The unemployment rate has fallen from 15 percent in April 2020 to 4.2 percent today. The U.S. poverty rate has declined following emergency economic relief.But complacency is as much an enemy as the virus itself. Everyone in America should have what they need to stay safe and healthy—no matter who they are, where they live, or how much money they make.Yet we are falling well short of that standard. More than 800,000 Americans have died from COVID-19, widening the existing life expectancy gap between the U.S. and other nations. Any declaration of victory now, particularly in light of Omicron, is wishful and dangerous thinking.Finishing the job requires prioritizing these strategies:Individual choices go a long way towards protecting our families, communities, and country. COVID-19 vaccines lower the risk of severe disease and death significantly; as physicians, we endorse vaccination without hesitation, and strongly encourage all those eligible to get their booster shots. But our choices are often influenced and affected by the actions of public officials. Surveys show that false, anti-science propaganda about vaccines is especially prominent in areas with low vaccination rates.A passer-by enters a pharmacy with a vaccination advisory attached to a door, right, Thursday, Dec. 2, 2021, in Worcester, Mass. As the U.S. recorded its first confirmed case of the omicron variant, doctors across the country are experiencing a more imminent crisis with a delta variant that is sending record numbers of people to the hospital in New England and the Midwest. (AP Photo/Steven Senne)Public officials who peddle such myths and conspiracy theories take a rather dim and disrespectful view of their constituents. A case built on lies only demonstrates a fear of the truth. We are confident that more Americans will continue to see through and tune out these deceptions and instead decide to roll up their sleeves.The Delta variant was first identified in India, and Omicron in South Africa. Oceans cannot protect America from invisible threats. Nearly half the world—including nearly 90 percent of Africa’s population—remains unvaccinated, with the vast majority of shots administered in wealthy and upper-middle income countries.The United States has the resources, moral authority and public support to increase its global vaccine contributions and galvanize other nations of means to do the same, but a chasm exists between what we have done and what we could do—the 320 million doses we have distributed globally to date is less than 30% of the 1.1 billion doses we’ve pledged. Every shot that goes into the arm of someone outside our borders not only saves lives abroad but also provides an additional layer of safety for all Americans.FILE PHOTO: Pfizer/BioNTech's new pediatric COVID-19 vaccine vials are seen in this undated handout photo.

MANDATORY CREDIT/File Photo(Pfizer/Handout via REUTERS ATTENTION EDITORS - THIS IMAGE HAS BEEN SUPPLIED BY A THIRD PARTY. MANDATORY CREDIT/File Photo)COVID-19 tests, like COVID-19 vaccines, should be free, widespread, and plentiful. Omicron makes rapid testing an even higher priority, especially during the holiday season. But at-home tests are still far too expensive and/or inaccessible for many Americans.The Biden administration’s plan to have health insurance companies reimburse the cost of COVID-19 tests forces the insured to pay initial costs upfront, adds unnecessary administrative burdens, and keeps the onus on the uninsured to track down limited numbers of free tests at a limited number of places.Given that the unvaccinated face a significantly higher risk of getting and subsequently spreading COVID-19, ensuring regular testing for those individuals is especially important. We must make testing ubiquitous and err on the side of too many tests rather than too few.Fully vaccinated individuals should seek guidance of a health care provider should they develop COVID-like symptoms, (iStock)Even with a low unemployment rate overall, the U.S. remains down millions of jobs compared with pre-pandemic levels, and the continued economic fallout is hitting families with low wages especially hard. We should double down on what works. Advance payments of the expanded Child Tax Credit, for instance, have put more than $77 billion into the pockets of 61 million American families, lifting millions of children out of poverty and sharply reducing food insecurity.But monthly payments ended on December 15 and to date have not been renewed by Congress. The expanded Child Tax Credit should be made permanent.U.S. President Joe Biden walks to Marine One on the South Lawn of the White House December 17, 2021 in Washington, DC. Biden is traveling to Orangeburg, South Carolina to deliver a commencement address at South Carolina State University.( Drew Angerer/Getty Images)As both pediatricians and parents, we are grateful that children are at lower risk of severe disease and that the number of children eligible for vaccines continues to expand. But the direct effects of COVID-19 on children have been significant—more than 7 million have been infected, thousands have developed a severe inflammatory condition as a result of infection, and several hundred have died.Continuing to protect children—including universal masking in public indoor settings in areas of substantial or high transmission, as well as in schools and child care facilities—is the responsibility of every adult. We also must not forget the estimated 167,000 children who have lost a parent or caregiver to COVID-19. Communities have stepped up to provide support, but there is a shortage of professional mental health services at a time when the need continues to grow. This must be a national priority well beyond this pandemic.FILE PHOTO: A child reacts while receiving a dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine at Smoketown Family Wellness Center in Louisville, Kentucky, U.S., November 8, 2021.

This is the brain’s hard-wiring that runs deep, and it causes us to over-personalize the risks we face.WHITE HOUSE RIPPED FOR DOOMSDAY WINTER MESSAGE OF ‘SEVERE ILLNESS AND DEATH’ FOR UNVACCINATED PEOPLEPfizer/BioNTech's pediatric COVID-19 vaccine vials are seen in this undated photo.(Pfizer/Handout via Reuters/File photo)The omicron variant ofCOVID-19captures the negative imagination, causing too many of us to jump to worst case scenarios. Highly contagious or easily transmissible means that the fear is easily transmissible, too.So phrases like "sweeping across the country" consume us, and by the time we hear the balancing phrase "most cases mild," we are already convinced that for us omicron won’t be mild, despite our booster. We understand that recovery from COVID, plus a shot or a recent booster should protect us against all but the mildest case, but still we worry.Etched in our memories are last year’s closures and shutdowns, and we wince at each murmur of lockdowns returning, our lives once again heavily restricted or altogether ruined. President Joe Biden doesn’t appear to be a leader who assuages our fears as he scolds and threatens us with more and more mandates—ancient public health policy that hasn’t appeared effective at containing this virus.What might help us more are real tools—in addition to the vaccine—but they don’t appear to be forthcoming. Everyone should be receiving a supply of medical-grade KN95 or N95 masks, courtesy of the government, along with a pile of rapid COVID tests. These tests can let us know whether we contracted the virus or not without having to go outside and risk spreading it to others.Leah Lefkove, 9, shows off her vaccination sticker in Decatur, Georgia, on the first day COVID-19 vaccinations were available for children from 5 to 12 on Nov. 3, 2021. (AP Photo/Ben Gray)Also on my holiday wish list are the monoclonal antibodies, sotrivimab, made by GSK, uniquely suited to battle omicron if you get sick with it. And how about Paxlovid? It's the brand new Pfizer drug (protease inhibitor) that you can take by mouth with a marked decreased risk of hospitalization as a result. This pill will markedly decrease our COVID worries, yet it waits at the FDA’s door for emergency approval.This undated image provided by Pfizer in November 2021 shows the company's COVID-19 pills.(Pfizer via AP, File)And how about those targeted boosters to the specific variants that we have long been promised? If the White House invokes the Defense Production Act and pre-orders boosters, it would go a long way toward calming fears."Wear a mask, distance, open a window, wash your hands" are as true as ever, but no longer seem to calm our fears. We need our latest biotechnology to do that, paid for by the government, accelerated to fit the omicron timetable. A test and a pill in every house in America will go a long way to calm our fears.CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTERWhen it comes to the vaccine, I have been spending many months talking to my reluctant patients and viewers—too many of whom are not looking at this from a purely cost/benefit position, where the risk of the vaccine’s rare side effects are far outweighed by the short- and long-term risks of this treacherous virus.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPBut now it turns out that fear, if channeled properly, can help with compliance. I like to say that you should be more afraid of the virus than the vaccine.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided byRefinitiv Lipper.Fox News medical contributor Dr. Janette Nesheiwat joined 'Fox News Live' to discuss the new variant and what it could mean for looming closures.As we approach Christmas, our spirits are again dashed bygrowing COVID casesand news of cancellations: holiday parties, Broadway shows and even the iconic Rockettes have called it quits on Christmas 2021.President Biden, persistently off-key, is spreading gloom by warning of "a winter of severe illness and death" for the unvaccinated, hammering home yet again the need to take the shot. That’s what he’s got.Unfortunately, it’s not enough. Breakthrough cases, hospitalizations and deaths are mounting, as it turns out thevaccines’ effectivenessis not what we hoped, and especially against omicron. It is hard to find national data, as the government appears reluctant to admit that while the shots help protect most people from serious illness and death, they are not foolproof.MANCHIN KILLS BUILD BACK BETTER AND GIVES NATION – AND REPUBLICANS – A BIG WINCertain states are filling in the gaps. Minnesota, for example, has reported 116,000 COVID cases among fully vaccinated people since Nov. 7; of those, 4,701 were hospitalized and 839 people have died.In Maine, which has one of the highest vaccination rates in the country (with 95% of the over-65 crowd fully vaxxed), 59% of deaths in October were among the fully vaccinated, prompting Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, to ask Anthony Fauci to explain the growing toll during a Senate hearing. He could not.Americans are discouraged by the surge in omicron; many are angry. After all, Joe Biden promised to beat the virus.That may be why in a recent Economist poll, only 24% of respondents "strongly approve" of Biden’s handling of the pandemic while 34% "strongly disapprove."Why have we not seen more progress in the battle against the virus?Biden opened his final debate against President Trump saying, "220,000 Americans dead. If you hear nothing else that I say tonight, hear this: anyone who’s responsible for not taking control, in fact not saying, ‘I take no responsibility initially,’ anyone responsible for that many deaths should not remain as president of the United States of America."The message is garbled, of course, but it is nonetheless clear: COVID is Trump’s fault, and I will do better. And yet, amazingly, he has not. As of November, COVID deaths under President Biden surpassed those recorded during 2020; so far this year, the tragic total is about 390,000.Why have we not seen more progress in the battle against the virus?Maybe because Joe Biden’s White House has been laser-focused on promoting a costly progressive welfare agenda and undoing President Trump’s legacy instead of addressing the nation’s most urgent concerns, like inflation or stamping out COVID.Maybe because the administration has politicized the virus or is simply incompetent. Possibly … all of the above.Consider this: the White House, incredibly, has failed to bring on board a new full-time commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, a position left vacant all year.In fact, the White House did nominate Robert Califf, former FDA commissioner under President Obama, to fill the critical post, but failed to submit the candidate’s paperwork on time, thus delaying his installation until next year.Why is that important? Because the FDA needs to quickly approve new COVID therapies and has dragged its feet in approving fast virus tests, making such products scarcer and more expensive than in Europe. Even the left-leaning Bloomberg editorial board described the paperwork miss amid a "national health crisis" as "incompetence."In addition to the FDA lapse, the Biden White House has frequently issued contradictory guidance on masks and shutdowns and boosters; even the New York Times described the messaging as "muddled."Last October, Candidate Biden blamed COVID deaths on the fact that Trump "still has no plan" and promised he had one. This was the pitch that – more than anything – got Biden elected. How has his plan panned out?First, he was wrong. Trump had a plan, which was to develop a vaccine. Operation Warp Speed delivered the shot in record time, allowing all Americans to reduce their chances of developing serious illness or even death. The Commonwealth Fund says the shot has saved one million lives.Biden’s plan, meanwhile, failed to materialize. Biden campaigned during 2020 on establishing a nationwide mask mandate, until it became clear that such regulations were likely illegal.He also promised to beef up testing, but it has only been in recent weeks, with the surge in omicron cases, that the White House has promised to make 50 million free tests available to uninsured Americans. Those with insurance lucky enough to find a test will have to pay for them.Instead of a mask mandate, Biden has pushed a controversial vaccine mandate, since millions remain unprotected. The reluctance of some to be vaccinated (and more recently boosted) is a failure of this president, who rails about the politicization of COVID but has been its single biggest author.CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTERPresident Trump accused Biden of spreading "anti-vaccine rhetoric"; he was right. Biden repeatedly questioned the safety of the shot, hinting that Trump might have pressured health authorities to green-light the drug for political purposes and saying he did not "trust" the president. That did not inspire confidence.Biden convinced Americans, helped by friendly media outposts, that our country’s tragic loss of life and horrific economic jolt was Trump’s fault, and an alarmed electorate bought the lie.As of Biden’s inauguration date, the U.S. had recorded 123.9 deaths per 100,000 citizens; that was fewer than the UK’s 136.4 deaths per hundred thousand, but ahead of the EU, where deaths stood at 96.5. Just last week, the U.S. had suffered 242 deaths per hundred thousand citizens, ahead of the UK (219) and the EU (197). In effect, our cumulative comparative totals have been worse under Biden than under Trump.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPIt was ridiculous to blame Trump for the pandemic; neither is Biden responsible for the terrible toll taken by COVID-19. But Biden foolishly promised he could do better, and he has failed.Americans are weary, and they feel cheated. They elected Joe Biden because they believed him.

When the wife and husband team began Brewed Downtown nine years ago and gradually built it up into a solid business, they could not have foreseen that they would one day be hit by apandemic, a supply chain crisis,inflationand the ever-expanding corporate machine.What kept Michelle and Eric going was not money, though they certainly needed to earn enough to maintain a lifestyle Michelle described as "not poor but not middle class either." Perhaps working Americans is the best way to describe them, and what kept them moving forward was community.I have to admit that I had become jaded with that word. I have lived inLos Angelesfor the past 25 years, and the hardest thing to find there or in other urban areas is a community, or even a sense of one. Most of thebusinesseslining the streets where I live are corporate-owned, and their windows are often covered in ads trying to entice the dollar out of my pocket and into theirs.However, when I walked into Brewed Downtown for the first time, there was a sense of Déjà vu as Michelle rolled up to me on her mobility scooter and greeted me with a mug of freshly brewed coffee that hit the spot. Customers stumbled in, sleep still in their eyes, and they were greeted by their names. As Eric made breakfast in the kitchen, conversations were picked up from where they were left off last time.FOX BUSINESS POLL: VOTERS THINK BIDEN IS MAKING INFLATION WORSEI felt like I was back at my old coffeehouse job in Monterey where I worked the night shift as a teenager. Most of my customers were Army personnel from nearby Fort Ord, and I had gotten to know them quite well. It reached the point where I looked forward to my shifts so I could continue my conversations or debates with them. That job had become my community and, sadly, that job, business and community disappeared overnight when President Clinton shuttered Fort Ord.Michelle confided to me that she feared the business could not survive both the supply chain crisis and inflation. When the pandemic hit, Brewed Downtown was one of the few businesses to remain open. Workers pumped food out through the drive-thru window to their thankful regulars.After many months, Michelle and Eric thought they had seen the worst. Then the supply chain crisis hit them hard. Still, Michelle managed, finding substitutions wherever possible. She was determined not to cut items from the menu since her regulars had their favorites, but, eventually, it was slimmed down.Then the prices began to rise on everything. She used to order 500 cups for about $50. Several weeks ago, that price rose to $148. The same thing went for lids, straws, napkins, flavored syrups, coffee beans and all the food items that filled the fridge and pantry.As the days went by and the prices continued to rise without respite, Michelle and Eric saw their bottom line dipping into the red. How could they reverse it? They inched up the prices several cents, but 85% of their customers areMarineswho make "next to nothing." Michelle knows the life of service well; she is a Navy veteran herself.Then the bottom dropped out. Last August, she received a phone call from her sales representative at US Foods, informing her that the company would no longer be able to service her business. The representative said that only the top 35% of all accounts would continue to receive shipments. In other words, corporate America got theirs while small businesses were left to fend for themselves.The sales representative told Michelle it was not personal. A fighter by nature, Michelle tried not to take it personally, but she couldn’t help it. She told me US Foods got its start with small businesses and grew on the back of small businesses to become the behemoth it is today. Michelle felt burned by the disloyalty after ordering from the company for 50 weeks every year for nine years straight.Michelle and Eric did not hang their heads for long, since the only thing they know how to do is work and be kind to other folks. They began grocery store runs, extending their work day by several hours and buying items for the same prices as the rest of us. Their bottom line dipped further into the red.BIDEN, DEMOCRATS AND CHINA ARE TO BLAME FOR AMERICA'S STAGFLATION MESSTo make matters even worse, when they turned on their television in the evenings, they heard leaders who were either tone deaf or far removed from the struggles ofsmall businessesacrossAmerica. PresidentBiden, who prides his Scranton working-class roots, announced that the Port of Los Angeles would be open an extra 60 hours a week to ease the supply chain crisis when it was already running 24 hours a day for seven days a week. Secretary of TransportationPete Buttigiegblamed the lack of workers on the lack of child care, ignoring the fact there was a child care issue before the pandemic and people still went to work. Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen repeatedly minimized the threat of inflation even as prices continued to rise before her very own eyes.When I asked Michelle how she was going to survive, her eyes welled up. She did not speak of herself or her husband or the business. She spoke of the community. She told me about the woman that came in with a disturbed look on her face. When Michelle asked what was wrong the woman revealed that she had been told that she had cancer, would need to have both breasts removed and only had a 17% chance of surviving. Michelle then told me of the teenage girl who was so shy that she rarely spoke to anyone. Yet, for some reason, she felt comfortable enough with Michelle to visit nearly every day for lunch and conversation. There were many more stories that Michelle told me, stories made possible because of the community that she and Eric created.The thing that I liked about Michelle and Eric is that they don’t live with their heads in the clouds. They know that many people would tell them to just quit the business and give up. But quitting is one thing they do not know how to do, and one only has to look into Michelle’s past to understand why.Before she graduated from high school in Reno, Nevada, she joined the Navy. Her brother had tragically died from cancer a few years before and her parents were in massive debt due to medical bills. Michelle told them to take the college money they saved for her and her brother and pay off the bills. She would go into the Navy and make her own way in the world.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPShe worked every day of her life except for maternity leave. Even a motorcycle accident that led to the eventual amputation of her leg could not stop her. She and Eric found themselves working for a corporation for years and, like many fellow small business owners, they decided to take a chance on themselves, their American Dream. They knew they wanted to be near the beach and a military base, and they made their home in Jacksonville. Michelle told me she loves her town without reservation and cannot imagine herself anywhere else.Before I left Brewed Downtown to fly home, Michelle gave me a long and emotional hug. Eric gave me a firm handshake that said it all. I was leaving two good friends and that is a testament to their character. When I returned to Los Angeles, I drove by my regular Starbucks and stopped at the small coffee shop that I had driven by countless times. The owner, an Argentinian woman, made me a cup of coffee nearly as good as Michelle’s. What struck me was the pride that she showed in her coffee and the interest that she showed in her customers. These people make communities possible. We have lost many of these folks over the years, especially the last few. The loss to the fabric of our society will be profound if we allow more of these working Americans to fall by the wayside.Eli Steele is a documentary filmmaker and writer.

This follows earlier deadlines for the Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps.It is also the day that may set into motion one of the most grievous injuries ever perpetrated upon our military by itscommander in chief.Why? Because President Biden is threatening to discharge every member of the military who expresses a religious exemption or nothing more than a cautionary reluctance to immediately obey hissweeping vaccine mandate. This would be as unnecessary as it is unjustified.HOW IS COVID GOING TO END?According to recent data from the Department of Defense, well more than 90% of every military branch has received a vaccination – with Navy and Air Force personnel surpassing a vaccination rate of 95%. That is a vaccination rate far greater than not only the nation at large (72%), but also any state in the nation. (Vermont has the nation’s highest vaccination rate at 75%.)But that’s not good enough for President Biden. He is declaring an unacceptable failure perhaps the most successful health utilization program in our nation’s history.That’s why my colleagues and I also wrote to President Biden and called on him not to be careless with the clear constitutional powers of his office and abuse his authority as the commander in chief. It is well past time for this administration – which has already profoundly let down our men and women in uniform with its disastrous and deadly withdrawal from Afghanistan – to turn back from this reckless campaign of brinksmanship it has undertaken against our best and brightest.Every day, another member of our military contacts my office seeking a way to ward off President Biden ending their career. They’re at a loss to understand the extent to which they’re being targeted by this White House.Only the military vaccine mandate remains unchanged, barreling toward its devastating toll.They’re not dissidents in our ranks. They’re war fighters and battle strategists, engineers and linguists, and soldiers and scholars. But they’re also fathers and mothers to children who need them and daughters and sons to parents who burst with pride at their service to our country.They are acting on the principles drilled into them throughout their career, and they don’t deserve to immediately lose their commissions or careers because of it.But that’s what is about to happen.As of today, however, as many as 50,000 soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines are on the brink of being dismissed from service for disagreeing with the Biden mandate or seeking a religious exemption. Some have informed me that instead of being thrown out, they will quit the duty they love, give up the mission they have trained for, and separate from their brothers in arms whose lives they swore to protect – and who swore to protect theirs.A final point about why this is so important.Think about the myriad Biden vaccine mandates on private sector employees, health care professionals, the federal workforce and its contractors.All were challenged successfully by a union, a lobby, a business interest, even attorneys general from more than a dozen states. All were stayed, delayed or halted.CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTEROnly the military vaccine mandate remains unchanged, barreling toward its devastating toll.Every one of those service members stepped forward in the prime of their lives and volunteered to defend this country and fight for all of us when we need it.

Turn your life upside down, send your kid to school in masks to eat lunch in chilly weather on the ground of the yard, and by all means get your two, or three, or however many vaccination jabs. If it can save just one life, and all that. But when it comes to crime, these same lefties have more risk tolerance than a drunk 22-year-old at a Vegas craps table. What gives?Think about this statement the progressive Milwaukee County District Attorney John Chisholm made when he was elected in 2007 regarding his lax approach tocrime, "Is there going to be an individual I divert, or I put into treatment program, who’s going to go out and kill somebody? You bet. Guaranteed. It’s guaranteed to happen. It does not invalidate the overall approach."AMERICANS WORRY ABOUT SOARING CRIME RATE -- DEMOCRATS RESPOND BY STANDING UP FOR CRIMINALSWe saw the fruits of this wrongheaded approach last month when Darrell Brooks Jr., exited the turnstile of Milwaukee County’s criminal justice system, despite a rap sheet longer than a CVS receipt, to allegedly murder 6 people at a Christmas parade.In New York, a grad student lost his life to a knife attack to another career criminal roaming Manhattan who should have been behind bars.It's happening all over the country. And it is making the law-abiding people of America second class citizens in their own cities. While Democrats moan and wail about the danger of the unvaccinated, even though we know that the vaccinated are perfectly capable of spreading COVID, our criminal class is coddled at every turn.CHICAGO FATHER VIOLENTLY ATTACKED, KILLED WHILE HANGING CHRISTMAS LIGHTS OUTSIDE HOME, FAMILY SAYSDemocrats and their media allies might argue that COVID and the hundreds of thousands of deaths it has wrought is on a different scale than our crime crisis. But that is little consolation to the families of those who died preventable deaths owing to woke prosecutors. And besides that, crime in our cities is a paralyzing force that rains negative outcomes down on millions of Americans.CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTERSo what explains this disparity in risk tolerance? Put simply, COVID has no claim to oppressed status, except maybe in regard to what we are allowed to call it. Sacrificing Americans to COVID serves no social justice purpose, but sacrificing Americans to crime does.Even regarding COVID we see this dynamic at work. Everyone, including American citizens who enter the country legally must run a gauntlet of COVID restrictions, but those who break into the country through our spaghetti strainer of a Southern border may traipse in free of any protocols at all. The migrants, you see, are oppressed, and exemptions must be made for them.Democrats lack the serenity to accept what they cannot change about COVID, they lack the courage to change what they can about crime and are severely lacking in the wisdom to see the difference.The irony here is that despite our best efforts for 2 years we have no idea how to effectively stop the spread of COVID, the Florida model, the New York Model, the Sweden model, the Australia model, all have pros and cons. But in regard to crime, we know exactly how to fight it. In cities across America, led by New York, the police tactics of the 1990s chopped crime at the knees, and yet we have abandoned those police and prosecutorial practices.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPDemocrats lack the serenity to accept what they cannot change about COVID, they lack the courage to change what they can about crime, and are severely lacking in the wisdom to see the difference.This is not a mystery that progressive prosecutors have to solve, we know how to fight crime in our major cities, it's time we get back to doing it.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM DAVID MARCUSDavid Marcus is a columnist living in New York City and the author of "Charade: The Covid Lies That Crushed A Nation."Get the recap of top opinion commentary and original content throughout the week.SubscribedYou've successfully subscribed to this newsletter!This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2022 FOX News Network, LLC.

In California, a new statewide mask mandate takes effect tomorrow. In Colorado, the Governor announced this week that the Covid emergency is over.Which decision is correct?DR. NICOLE SAPHIER: HOW IS COVID GOING TO END?Los Angeles, CA - November 10:Gov. Gavin Newsom takes questions during a press conference on COVID-19 vaccination and housing for homeless veterans at the West Los Angeles VA Medical Center in Los Angeles on Wednesday, November 10, 2021. (Photo by Sarah Reingewirtz/MediaNews Group/Los Angeles Daily News via Getty Images)(Photo by Sarah Reingewirtz/MediaNews Group/Los Angeles Daily News via Getty Images)California’s mandate comes not come from Governor Gavin Newsom. It comes from Dr. Tomás Aragón, the Director of the California Department of Public Health. This is an unelected position given power to issue such edicts due to the state of emergency declared by the governor almost two years ago. California has been in an ongoing state of emergency since, despite vaccines available to all and dramatic drops in infection rates.Before becoming director earlier this year, Dr. Aragon was the health officer for the City and County of San Francisco. Before that he was in charge of public health at University of California, Berkeley, where he is still an adjunct professor. He has degrees from Berkeley and Harvard.FILE - In this May 14, 2021, file photo, signs instruct visitors on the proper way to wear masks at the Universal City Walk in Universal City, Calif. California is keeping its rules for wearing facemasks in place until the state more broadly lifts its pandemic restrictions on June 15. State officials said Monday, May 17 that the delay will give people time to prepare, and for the state to make sure that virus cases stay low. (AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez, File)( (AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez, File))According to his biography, he became the state director earlier this year with a mission of "striving to embody and promote the universal values of dignity, equity, compassion and humility, he works through collaborative partnerships to mobilize communities and institutions to transform policies and systems towards a culture of equity, antiracism, healing and health for all people and our planet." Yes, he worked "equity" twice into the same sentence.The new edict begins by noting that the "vaccines remain effective in preventing serious disease, hospitalization, and death from the SARS-CoV-2 virus." Nonetheless, it goes on to state the Department "is requiring masks to be worn in all indoor public settings, irrespective of vaccine status, for the next four weeks (December 15, 2021, through January 15, 2022)."Los Angeles, CA - November 10:Gov.

(Photo by Sarah Reingewirtz/MediaNews Group/Los Angeles Daily News via Getty Images)( (Photo by Sarah Reingewirtz/MediaNews Group/Los Angeles Daily News via Getty Images))The Order states the mandate is necessary because, "Since Thanksgiving, the statewide seven-day average case rate has increased by 47 percent and hospitalizations have increased by 14 percent." But it ignores the fact that mask mandates have already long been in place in many counties in the State. The Order expands the rule to all counties.Yet, it provides zero analysis of the spread of Covid in counties with the mandate versus those without it! Should this not be the most basic due diligence to conduct before issuing an order infringing on individual liberty, and which overrides decisions of local governments and impacts people from Bakersfield to Barstow and Modesto to Tahoe?Ina Coolbrith Park, San Francisco, California, USA.(iStock)Compare this to Colorado -- same virus, same human species -- where Governor Jared Polis just announced: "The emergency is over… Frankly, people who want to be protected [have gotten vaccinated]. Those who get sick, it's almost entirely their own darn fault."No new mask mandate in response to another new variant. Rather, Polis said, "Our top goal is always to follow the science, and there was a time when there was no vaccine, and masks were all we had, and we needed to wear them. The truth is we now have highly effective vaccines that work far better than masks… You don’t tell people to wear a jacket when they go out in winter and force them to [wear it]. If they get frostbite, it’s their own darn fault."Colorado Gov. Jared Polis speaks during a news conference about Colorado offering coronavirus vaccinations to children, Thursday, Oct. 28, 2021, in Denver.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided byRefinitiv Lipper.Fox News medical contributor Dr. Nicole Saphier argues on 'Hannity' that there will likely be consequences if more coronavirus mandates are implemented.The concept of "Zero COVID," once perhaps a realistic ambition, is now a delusion as variants continue traveling the world circulating among humans and animals.Thankfully, theinitial waves of the pandemic, the devastating stages of intense transmission with a high rate of consequent severe illness, are over for most of the country. This doesn’t mean the virus is gone, or that transmission is low, rather the pandemic is moving into the next phase, becoming endemic.It is almost certain theCOVID-19 pandemicwill evolve similar to the 1918 influenza virus.FACE MASKS FOREVER? AMERICANS WON'T STAND FOR IT. TIME TO DROP THE MASKSA century ago, a novel strain of influenza killed more than 50 million people worldwide. With time, those who contracted the virus and survived developed immunity, with life returning to normal several years later. The virus did not disappear. The virus continued to mutate, with seasonal outbreaks from milder variants, further dampened by vaccines and treatments.Sound familiar?The original strain of influenza was killing people of all ages, but modern day "flu," caused by lineages of the original strain, mostly affects young children and the elderly.It is too early to be certain, but the newest variant of concern, omicron, may be the path to making this virus endemic, if health officials would only let it. Early data on omicron show that cases are rising among the vaccinated and unvaccinated, but milder symptoms are being reported in both groups.Nearly two years since the first case of COVID-19 was reported in Wuhan, the combination of lessened virulence, natural immunity, vaccinations and updated treatment protocols have reduced the harm of this virus. The current overall death rate (0.8%) is nearly half of what it was during last year’s winter surge (1.4%) and 10 times less than the initial wave during spring 2020 (8%).To end the hysteria, public health officials must communicate effectively accurate, metric-driven data with advice (not mandates) on risk reduction strategies, rather than media-hyped conjecture.Americans don’t need a White House press conference every time a new SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern is announced, especially as they become milder. New strains and variants of influenza enter our shoreline every year, yet the president doesn’t address the nation warning of impending doom, a term coined by CDC Director Rochelle Walensky during the pandemic.To end the hysteria, public health officials must communicate effectively accurate, metric-driven data with advice (not mandates) on risk reduction strategies, rather than media-hyped conjecture.This past week, headlines emphasized the Pfizer CEO suggesting a fourth dose of vaccine might be necessary, causing frustration and concern. This may be true for high-risk individuals, with an annual COVID booster eventually being recommended, similar to the flu shot. However, the current conversation surrounding boosters is myopic and premature. Also, Americans shouldn't be getting public health updates from Big Pharma.Boosting the younger, healthier populations now may be delaying the virus from becoming endemic. Allowing the virus to "run its course" has never been a public health strategy as it is risky and will lead to preventable death. However, the COVID vaccines are still protecting against severe disease and shortening the length of illness. Permitting milder infection to circulate will only increase population immunity. We have never required a vaccine to prevent the sniffles.The addition of natural immunity from prior COVID-19 infection in a vaccinated person provides robust, long-term protection, more so than vaccine-induced immunity alone, as suggested in the SIREN study looking at over 30,000 health care workers in the U.K.Data from the CDC show the risk of hospitalization from COVID after vaccination to be about 1 in 26,000. To put that in perspective, the lifetime odds of dying in a car crash on the way to work are 1 in 107, according to the National Safety Council (NSC). Of the fully vaccinated who are hospitalized from COVID, the average age is over 70 – which is why boosting those over 65 and other high-risk individuals has been unanimously supported. Now that the CDC has recommended boosters for everyone 16 and older, anyone who wants to further reduce their exceedingly low risk of severe illness, is able to.People are still dying from the novel coronavirus, approximately 1,000 people a day. While the number of deaths is high, it is far less than the country has seen. The majority of preventable deaths occurring now are in people who chose not to be vaccinated and those over 80 years, similar to flu.Health officials should allow this coronavirus to become seasonal, like the many other respiratory viruses Americans live with.CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTERIt is obvious that extending the state of emergency is driving our children crazy, destroying our economy, and dividing the country.The small group of people who make most policy decisions are perpetuating this pandemic and prolonging the panic with regular media interviews, press conferences, daily case counts and focusing on risk exclusion rather than risk reduction.The constant pursuit by the White House and other government officials to boost and restrict until there are zero cases may make for good optics during election cycles, but the scientific perspective is to maximize life while minimizing death.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPFuture actions should focus on reducing COVID hospitalizations while permitting mild illness to circulate. This can be done through vaccination and healthy lifestyle choices, while boosting anyone who wants it, but especially high-risk individuals and their close contacts.It is time to get back to living life without generalized mask-wearing and vaccine cards. Americans are ready to show their smiles and shake hands again, accepting there will always be risk in everyday life.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FROM DR.

Stan Baker found that President Joe Biden had exceeded his authority in mandating the vaccine for all federal contractors. In the meantime, outgoing New York Mayor Bill de Blasio has ordered all private workers to be vaccinated.OMICRON IN THE US: WHERE IS IT THIS WEEK?All of these mandates are on course for a showdown in the Supreme Court, where three justices have already expressed skepticism over the mandates.Biden issued an executive order on Sept. 9 that required contractors to ensure that their workers are vaccinated against COVID and enforcing mask and social distancing policies. Contractors were given until Dec. 8 to comply, but that was later extended to Jan. 4.The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Georgia granted a preliminary injunction in favor of the Associated Builders and Contractors, a national trade group that represents the construction industry. To do so, the court had to find that the challengers were likely to prevail on the merits in arguing that President Biden does not have this authority under the Procurement Act.Judge Baker wrote, "In its practical application, it operates as a regulation of public health. It will also have a major impact on the economy at large, as it limits contractors’ and members of the workforce’s ability to perform work on federal contracts. Accordingly, it appears to have vast economic and political significance."President Joe Biden delivers remarks on the debt ceiling at the White House on Oct. 4, 2021.(AP Photo/Evan Vucci)White House press secretary Jen Psaki insisted that the Biden administration is "confident in our ability legally to make these happen across the country." While the administration could certainly prevail on appeal, the confidence remains an exercise of hope over experience in such litigation.Other courts have enjoined mandates under OSHA and Medicare. In the OSHA case, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled based on its own "serious constitutional concerns."In theprior column, I noted that chief of staff Ron Klain acknowledged that the use of OSHA was a "work around" in light of the constitutional barriers preventing President Biden from ordering a national mandate directly. The Fifth Circuit quoted Klain in a footnote in granting its injunction.Biden and Klain often seem to be competing for the greatest admissions-against-interest, including a prior admission from President Biden that they would be pursuing a presumptively unconstitutional measure simply to buy more time to spend more money on the now defunct eviction moratorium.Ron Klain speaks during a House Homeland Security Subcommittee hearing in Washington on March 10, 2020.(Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images)Klain was celebrating a way to evade constitutional limitations—but for courts reviewing the OSHA rule, that is akin to a husband telling a spouse that he has found a "work-around" to his vows by redefining extramarital relations.The federal litigation raises separate issues from those likely to be raised against de Blasio’s mandate. New York will rely entirely on Jacobson v. Massachusetts (1905), in which the Supreme Court upheld a state smallpox vaccination mandate. The case has already been used successfully in other courts like the Seventh Circuit, including decisions from conservative jurists. See Klaassen v. Trustees of Indiana Univ. ("Given Jacobson v. Massachusetts…there can’t be a constitutional problem with vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 [aka COVID-19]"). They have applied the low "rational basis" standard to uphold such mandates in light of Jacobson.But Jacobson is not a lead pipe cinch of precedent. It involved smallpox, a disease with a much higher lethality of up to 30 percent of those infected. The disease also hit children to a far greater extent than COVID. It also involved a vaccine that was used for years and was universally accepted as safe. The case also involved only a $5 fine as opposed to bring barred from employment, dining, travel and other basic functions in life.CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTEROn Oct. 29, 2021, three Supreme Court justices dissented in a case where they felt review should have been granted. Justices Gorsuch, Thomas, and Alito raised questions over whether past deference on the pandemic is warranted and warned that the "compelling interest" recognized in such past cases "cannot qualify as such forever."Many of us support vaccinations. The question is whether there is the legal authority to require others to be vaccinated. Jacobson is likely to carry considerable weight in the review of state and city mandates.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPHowever, the question is whether courts will demand more from the government in addressing issues of religious exemptions and natural antibodies. Studies indicate that such natural antibodies confer greater protection than vaccines though most doctors still encourage vaccinations.Over the last year, courts have remained highly deferential. However, the three justices previously noted that "if human nature and history teach us anything, it is that civil liberties face grave risks when governments proclaim indefinite states of emergency."CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM JONATHAN TURLEYGet the recap of top opinion commentary and original content throughout the week.SubscribedYou've successfully subscribed to this newsletter!This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2022 FOX News Network, LLC.

It could have different mutations, different symptoms, and require different treatments. But rather than freaking out, we should take the next week or two to see what becomes of it.President Biden on the other hand, has already followed suit with Dr. Fauci in foolishly announcing public health policy that is not based on any science. Mandating a COVID test within 24 hours of international travel, ignores the fact that rapid tests for patients without symptoms give false readings about half the time.BIDEN JOKES THAT FAUCI IS PRESIDENT, SAYS HE SEES FAUCI MORE THAN FIRST LADYMeanwhile, medical officials in South Africa, where the variant originated, have been shocked at the knee-jerk reaction from countries across the world in imposing travel restrictions and renewing mandates.EvenDr. Angelique Coetzee, who discovered the new variant, has said countries, including the United States, are "panicking unnecessarily." Dr. Coetzee has also said, "the simple truth is: we don’t know yet anywhere near enough about omicron to make such judgments or to impose such policies."This is a prime example of big government thinking it must do something out of gut reaction, but in all likelihood, government will do the wrong thing. The ink on the travel ban has barely dried and reports are already coming in that the omicron variant is less deadly. In addition, the variant is now in nearly 40 countries, so a travel ban will have little effect.We need to pause, learn more about the omicron variant, and in the meantime not impose travel restrictions that will tank the U.S. and world economies, ensue chaos, and frankly do nothing to change the course of this new variant.FLORIDA REPORTS LOWEST DAILY CORONAVIRUS CASES PER CAPITA IN NATIONNot to mention the fact that while we implement travel restrictions on U.S. citizens and other countries, our southern border remains wide open with very little being done to test migrants who are being released by the thousands into our country. Apparently, President Biden’s newCOVID-19 "strategy"only applies to law-abiding citizens, and not illegal aliens.The default solution for big government types like President Biden and Dr. Fauci is always more rules, more regulation and less of your liberty.Our response shouldn’t be a blanket decision for the whole world, on locking the economy down, locking the country up, and banning travel before we know for sure whether this is a more or less deadly variant.Instead, if the government wants to do something productive for once, it could get out of the way of vaccine and drug development, and allow for new vaccines and drugs to come to market quicker.CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTERPresident Trump did it, and because of Operation Warp Speed, drug companies and researchers were able to develop the first COVID-19 vaccine in record time, saving countless lives.For months, I’ve urged the Biden administration to do the same thing, cut regulations and red tape to allow for the quick development of a new COVID vaccine that responds better to variants. While some companies are currently in trials, at no point has the Biden administration – including President Biden and Dr. Fauci – made efforts to speed up the process of getting a new vaccine or treatments to market.If anyone in that administration had any competence at all they would be taking steps to adapt the COVID vaccine like they adapt the flu vaccine each year, and let Americans make their own individual decision on whether or not to be vaccinated.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPInstead, they will continue to preach about booster shots, yell about masks, threaten you, the American people with vaccine mandates, and blame all of their problems and failures on the never-ending pandemic.It is by far time we fire Dr. Fauci, and for the Biden administration to come up with a reasonable, rational plan that follows actual science and acknowledges Americans’ individual rights and liberties.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FROM SEN.

Thousands ofseniors were dyingin New York nursing homes, where staff could not turn away or test incoming infected patients. We were all quarantined and couldn’t have wakes or funerals for my husband’s parents after theytragically diedin their long-term care facilities.JANICE DEAN: IT'S ANDREW CUOMO'S LAST DAY AS GOVERNOR. MY FIGHT WON'T STOP AFTER HE'S GONEYet, these two clowns – Gov. Andrew Cuomo and his brother, CNN anchor Chris Cuomo – were yucking it up on cable television.And I am so grateful it happened.It was the very next day that I decided to share my family’s story on Tucker Carlson’s show.Had the Cuomos both done the job they were hired to do – Chris reporting the news and Andrew governing the state of New York – this day when they are now both out of work would never have come.And now it seems, both brothers are cut from the same cloth: accused of abusing their power to smear others and sexually harass the women they worked with.The former governor resigned in disgrace in August after 11 women came forward with their stories of the luv guv’s unwanted comments and touching. Chris Cuomo was suspended and then fired this past week when CNN brass saw evidence of him using his position to gain information and try to discredit the women who were coming forward about Andrew’s creepy behavior.What has happened is starting to feel like justice. It’s not over yet.And now we find out that Chris has been accused of making the women around him feel uncomfortable and harassed.Many people have asked me if I feel any vindication seeing these two finally pushed off the stage. I will say that this time last year I never thought it would happen. I almost gave up trying to fight for the thousands of elderly that died thanks to Andrew Cuomo’s deadly leadership. These two men had the support of almost all in the media. It felt like our voices could never be as loud as theirs.But then, the truth began to come out in January: A bombshell report from the state Attorney General’s Office confirming what we all had predicted: The state Department of Health was under counting the nursing home deaths.Little by little, month by month, there was more information coming out about the corruption and lies by Andrew Cuomo and his administration. The $5.2 million book deal using state resources, the active lying and cover up of the nursing home deaths, the VIP COVID tests given to family and friends while care facilities were prohibited to test incoming patients, and the pervasive and perverted treatment of women.The mainstream media could no longer ignore the stories: They had to report on the overwhelming evidence. Once again, the attorney general released more information and evidence supporting everything we were screaming about.Over the last year I have been in touch with dozens of families who have lost loved ones. I’ve also become very close to some of the women who were abused, harassed and retaliated against by Andrew Cuomo and his evil empire.CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTERWhat has happened is starting to feel like justice. It’s not over yet. There are still several investigations that have yet to be completed by the FBI and the Justice Department. I believe there will be criminal charges.So, our fight isn’t over yet.But I am grateful that what made me speak out a year and a half ago – seeing those two brothers on television joking around while so many of us were deep with despair – will never ever happen again.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThe Cuomo Brothers Comedy Hour has finally been canceled.I am grateful for that.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FROM JANICE DEANJanice Dean joined FOX News Channel (FNC) in January 2004 where she currently serves as senior meteorologist for the network.

Instead, he focused on:1. Expanding the nationwide booster program with more outreach.2. Opening new family vaccination clinics.BIDEN SAYS THE US MUST 'VACCINATE THE REST OF THE WORLD' TO BEAT COVID-19 PANDEMIC3. Making free home tests more readily available, covered by insurance and with more central locations for the uninsured.4. Expanding the medical surge response team to respond to an increase in COVID cases.5. Expanding international support with a stated goal to "vaccinate the world."Are these ideas useful? Yes. Will they solve our COVID problem or the tremendous collateral damage it has and will cause? Answer: no.Will Biden’s new plan quash the new variant or diminish our rising hysteria over this unknown risk? Answer – not quite.BIDEN JOKES THAT FAUCI IS PRESIDENT, SAYS HE SEES FAUCI MORE THAN FIRST LADYWe have a viral problem here in the United States, and it isn’t the new COVID variant, omicron. The much larger problem goes beyond COVID to the fear it creates. (More about that in a moment.)Don’t get me wrong, we certainly need to learn more about the virus and the new variant. Early indications from South Africa reveal that it is fairly spreading easily, there is a heightened reinfection rate, it can sometimes cause severe illness (data on hospitalizations are still emerging), but almost all those hospitalized are unvaccinated.In other words, being fully vaccinated likely offers substantial protection against this variant, especially if you have recently been boosted or have had the vaccine on top of having had COVID (a combination which offers substantial immunity).Early indications from Pfizer and elsewhere indicate that the smattering of antibodies produced by the vaccine will offer a significant level of protection against omicron, especially when it comes to severe disease.WHITE HOUSE SAYS DOMESTIC TRAVEL VACCINE REQUIREMENTS ON THE TABLE DUE TO OMICRON VARIANTI believe this protection will likely be augmented by a recent vaccine dose or recovery from COVID. The president didn’t provide a tangible plan on Thursday of how his administration plans to reach out to the 60 million Americans who are still completely unvaccinated here in the U.S. without shaming them or coercing them into compliance.US COVID-19 Vaccine Progress Tracker | Vaccinations by State | USAFactsI believe the best method would still be to get the vaccine into doctors’ offices like mine where a vaccine conversation, with a discussion about the cost/benefit, generally takes place.Still to be determined is the omicron rate of reinfection, how rapidly this variant spreads, and how sick it makes particularly vulnerable groups such as the elderly and those with chronic health conditions. But early indications from South Africa show a trend similar to prior waves from the delta variant, etc.ADM. GIROIR: THERE IS NO REASON NEW YORK GOVERNOR SHOULD HALT ELECTIVE SURGERIESOne additional hopeful sign is that the prior South Africa variant, known as the beta variant, also contained mutations that could have rendered it more easily transmissible and capable of evading immunity, but in the end, this variant never established itself around the world the way alpha and delta (from India) did.This may be in part due to the extensive surveillance system that South Africa has, enabling it to identify a variant earlier, when its risks are more theoretical (based on genetic mutations) rather than actual.For many Americans the thought of potential infection with this new variant breeds fear. That’s a  terrain that’s been widely mined during this ferocious pandemic by politicians and the media alike. It doesn’t take much to get the fear juices flowing, and our leaders too often double down on this by introducing further restrictions. People over-personalize the risks from COVID when they are afraid, hence a single case in California, Minnesota or Colorado feels like there are many more and everyone worries they could be next.THIRD OMICRON CASE IN THE UNITED STATES DETECTED IN COLORADOMeanwhile, the real variant of concern remains delta, with averages over 100,000 new cases a day here in the U.S., with currently over 50,000 hospitalizations, and over 1,500 deaths.Covid in the U.S.: Latest Map and Case Count - The New York Times (nytimes.com)Improved vaccination rates among Americans hinge on more direct doctor/patient involvement rather than more superimposed mandates without a testing option or allowance for immunity due to disease recovery.We also need free rapid tests in every home in America provided by the Biden administration with a new public/private partnership patterned after Operation Warp Speed.We need to combat omicron hysteria because it takes away from attention to delta and to COVID in general.CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTERHysteria-driven pronouncements about omicron lead to distrust of the scientific process, which can then corrode into believability and compliance towards COVID and all SARS COV 2 variants.We certainly have no room for a variant that resembles "the boy who cried wolf." Though I am concerned about the number of mutations to the coronavirus, I am reassured by the likely immune protection along with the emergence of the new oral anti-viral treatments. There is no overall sense right now that this variant is more dangerous than delta, perhaps even lessFear is its own virus. We think we are rational creatures until we encounter the unknown, the unknowable, the potentially deadly.Our psyches have been badly damaged by this pandemic and we are afraid of being locked down or otherwise restricted all over again.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPI am glad that the president didn’t suggest this on Thursday, but still, the fear runs high.Omicron may end up being milder than delta, which would be a great public health development, but it is unlikely we would ever see a press conference to announce this.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM DR.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided byRefinitiv Lipper.Kentucky Senator Rand Paul says it's 'foolish' for the government to issue public health policy until more is know about the omicron variant.As President Biden announces a slew of new COVID restrictions on Thursday it's worth taking a look back at the failures of the cast of bunglers and bumblers he has put in charge of what we can and cannot do. It is a shameful record that strongly suggests none of these people should be in charge of an Arby’s drive-thru, much less our pandemic response.Dr.Anthony Fauci, the self-appointed Emperor God of Science, is taking a lot of heat these days, and for good reason. It's not just his cavalcade of mistakes over the past two years but also his refusal to accept any criticism of himself as even vaguely legitimate.Dr. Anthony Fauci speaks during the daily briefing at the White House in Washington, Wednesday, Dec. 1, 2021.(AP Photo/Susan Walsh)But, honestly, the problem is far bigger than Fauci. In fact, the entirety of President Joe Biden’s White HouseCOVIDTask Force has been an abysmal disaster, and it is time for a change.FAUCI DODGES QUESTION ON ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS FOLLOWING SAME TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS AS AMERICANS: ‘DIFFERENT ISSUE’The task force is led by Jeff Zientz, and features CDC Director Rochelle Walensky and Fauci as the scientific faces of the operation. Let’s take a look at the havoc they have wrought.In early May, the CDC quietly announced they would stop tracking breakthrough cases that did not lead to hospitalization or death. At the time experts warned this was a terrible decision. Why? They feared it would leave scientists blind if a new variant emerged. That is, of course, exactly what happened.The entrance of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia. (iStock)By August, as the delta variant was surging, Fauci would reverse course, telling "Meet the Press" that "we need to do more testing" of the vaccinated. In fact, at that point, nobody in the task force or at the White House could answer just how susceptible vaccinated people were to the new strain of the virus, or how much they could spread it, because they hadn’t bothered to track it.As a result of this throughout the summer, confusion reigned as anecdotal breakthrough cases emerged from every corner of the country. When 10 out of 60 vaccinated Texas Democrats arrived in Washington, D.C., testing positive, it was clear to anyone with eyes that vaccinated people were getting and spreading COVID.Dr. Anthony Fauci during the daily briefing at the White House in Washington, Wednesday, Dec. 1, 2021.(AP Photo/Susan Walsh)But answers for the American people were not forthcoming from the Biden administration. In late July, when a breakthrough case was reported at the White House, press secretary Jen Psaki was asked how many there were and declined to answer, saying, "Why do you need to have that information?" A week later the CDC reversed course on masking, urging vaccinated Americans to once again don the mouth muzzles.Now, as the micron variant looms on the horizon another abject failure of the Biden Task Force has become clear. Once again it involves a lack of testing. As Dr. Marc Siegel put it, "It is inexcusable that almost two years in the worst pandemic in a hundred years, we still don’t have free testing in every home, provided by the federal government through public-private partnership like Operation Warp Speed."Perhaps the greatest failure of this iteration of the task force is its utter inability to communicate effectively with the American people. Whatever one may say about the excessive nature of the marathon task force press conferences of the Trump era, every question was answered.This task force instead holds Zoom pressers, often as short as 25 minutes, with few questions and fewer follow-ups. The result is that the citizenry, through its news media, has been utterly unable to effectively interrogate the ivory tower, elite scientists apparently making huge decisions about our lives.The mismanagement listed above is far more egregious than any mistake made by Trump’s task force, despite the fact that when Biden took office we had been studying COVID for a year and had three working vaccines. Had the task force allowed its feet to be held to the fire by the press, many of the mistakes listed above could have been avoided.Instead, a steady lack of trust has taken hold. Americans are needlessly confused and have been almost since the moment Biden took the oath of office. Transparency has been replaced by "shut up and do as you’re told."From the border to Afghanistan to the economy, it is clear that Biden has no desire to punish incompetence. It is hard to imagine what, if any, kind of disastrous mismanagement could get anybody in the administration fired. But as regards the task force, change is needed and it is needed today.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPWe need transparency, we need competence, we need real press conferences. Put simply, we need wholesale change in the scientific leadership of our pandemic response.More than anything, we need a task force that does the research and tells us the unvarnished truth, not whatever they think will bend our behavior to their will. Until that happens, this national nightmare will never end.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM DAVID MARCUSDavid Marcus is a columnist living in New York City and the author of "Charade: The Covid Lies That Crushed A Nation."Get the recap of top opinion commentary and original content throughout the week.SubscribedYou've successfully subscribed to this newsletter!This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2022 FOX News Network, LLC.

The Biden administration informed the people ofMozambiquein a presidential proclamation supposedly signed by Biden himself that they are no longer allowed in the United States. It's nothing personal. It's omicron, the new COVID variant that has been used to justify lockdowns around the world. The problem is the confusion came from the fact that there was no omicron at the time in Mozambique. There wasn’t a single reported case of it in the country when the proclamation was signed.So it's possible that one of the equity hires at the White House confused Mozambique with Botswana, where the other day two people may possibly have died of omicron. Either way, Mozambique and Botswana don't even share a border, so people in Mozambique were highly confused and probably a little hurt. Today, Tony Fauci, who is the person, of course, who signed off on this travel ban, was asked about this by an African reporter. You know, Fauci replied, That's a good question. An important question. And then Fauci didn't answer it or even hint at an answer.BIDEN SAYS OMICRON VARIANT IS ‘CAUSE FOR CONCERN, NOT CAUSE FOR PANIC’So as of right now, we still don't know why there is aWhite Housetravel ban on Mozambique. Presumably, the answer is because it's in Africa and Africa is where all of this started. Just a few days ago, when the head of the South African Medical Association, a physician called Angelique Coetzee, noted that she had seen patients with a new variant of the coronavirus. Within hours of her, saying that politicians in the United States and many other countries began planning elaborate and highly punitive new measures against their own populations.From her office in Pretoria, Dr. Coetzee watched all of this happen with her jaw open. She was horrified. "I have been stunned at the response," Coetzee wrote this week in a piece for the Daily Mail. "No one here in South Africa is known to have been hospitalized with the Omicron variant, nor has anyone here believed to have fallen seriously ill with it." In other words, omicron, whatever it is, is far less dangerous than pretty much everything else that's currently going on in South Africa at the moment. But it didn't matter.By this point. The Biden administration had stopped listening to Dr. Angelique Coetzee. They'd gotten what they needed from her, and they moved on.So here'sTony Faucitoday announcing that the terrifying scourge of omicron has reached our shores:DR. FAUCI: The recent case of COVID 19 among an individual in California was caused by the omicron variant. The individual was fully vaccinated and experienced mild symptoms, which are improving at this point.OK, so let's just parse this just for a moment. A fully vaccinated person inCaliforniahas omicron and is doing fine. So what can we conclude rationally from this?Well, obviously the most stringent COVID restrictions in the country are not stopping the spread. Masking, social distancing, nonstop anxiety, talking aboutCOVIDfrom dawn to dusk. None of it worked, and the vaccines didn't work, either. The patient in California had two injections and still got omicron. So maybe the lesson here is viruses are very hard to stop. Sometimes they're virtually impossible to stop because they spread with remarkable efficiency. In the case of coronaviruses, they live in animals, so they're never going away, ever. No matter what. They don't tell you that, but it's true.DOCTOR EXPLAINS HOW OMICRON VARIANT COULD SPEE3D UP END OF COVID PANDEMICSo given all of those facts, it's possible we'll be better off working on medicines to keep those viruses from killing vulnerable people. That seems like a rational approach to the problem, and yet is the one thing the Biden administration is completely uninterested in doing. No interest whatsoever in doing that.Instead, Biden announced today that the lesson he is drawing from the harmless infection of a fully vaccinated person in the state of California is that this is a pandemic of the unvaccinated. They're the ones to blame for it, not theChinesegovernment which likely created this virus and has definitely profited from it immensely. No, no, no. Omicron andCOVIDmore broadly said the president, are the direct responsibility of the 20% of the adult American population, many of whom have natural immunity, who have resisted submitting to his injections, and they must be crushed for that.Now, this one is hardly worth explaining how far from legitimate science this is. It's nonsense. It's actually demented. But more than that, it is dangerous. On the basis of no demonstrated threat to public health whatsoever, the Biden administration is once again locking down the country and persecuting its perceived political opponents, otherwise known as the unvaccinated.So you have to ask yourself, when will this end? Viruses mutate constantly. That's their nature. Will every new omicron variant mean massive, new and unconstitutional powers for our political class? That's what is meant so far.OMICRON DETECTED IN CALIFORNIA, FIRST CASE IN THE US, OFFICIALS SAYThis is a cycle, and it's not a cycle that any democracy can survive. You'd think some of the media might point this out. What are the limits here? No. Instead, they're making certain you're as terrified as Joe Biden wants you to be.ALI VELSHI, MSNBC: The new covid 19 variant is causing global alarm as countries scramble to enact travel restrictions to contain the coronavirus threat…YASMIN VOSSOUGHIAN, MSNBC: The new omicron variant could already be in the U.S. but many Americans may not be ready to hear it. Reaction to this latest threat…BARBIE NADEAU: This new threat of the omicron variant…BRIANNA KEILAR, CNN:  …on the economic threat posed by the omicron variant…ABC NEWS REPORTER: The potential threat of omicron…PAULA REID, CNN: The emerging threat of omicron…KATE BOULDAN, CNN: The omicron variant poses a new threat…CNN ANCHOR: The potential threat posed by this omicron variant…MIKA, MSNBC: What Americans need to know about the evolving threat…It's a threat they repeat over and over. It's almost like it's a script they're reading. Meanwhile, the Biden administration says it may force everyone entering the country, even American citizens, even people who are vaccinated, to enter some kind of mandatory quarantine when they get here. In their own country quarantine.Now that's, of course, assuming they arrive legally. Biden voters who sneak through over the Mexican border, as always, are exempt from all rules novaccination, no quarantine, just endless benefits and broad smiles.Leana Wen, the former Planned Parenthood ghoul you so often see on CNN talking about health, recently explained that thanks to omicron "there should be mandatory quarantine and post-arrival testing for all international travelers, as well as additional impetus for vaccination and boosters."Huh? Quarantine, mandatory quarantine for American citizens in their own country. Additional impetus for more vaccines.What does that mean, exactly? Well, we're not sure we can guess. We do know, among other things, it means a lot more spying on you. The CDC director explained the CDC is now a kind of intelligence agency.ROCHELLE WALENSKY: Currently, CDC is expanding a surveillance program with an express check to JFK, San Francisco, Newark and Atlanta airports, four of the busiest international airports in the country. This program allows for increased COVID testing for specific international arrivals, increasing our capacity to identify those with COVID-19 on arrival to the United States, and enhancing our surveillance for the omicron variant. Thanks to our updated travel policies earlier this month, we are also actively working with the airlines to collect passenger information that can be used by CDC and local public health jurisdictions to enhance contact tracing and post-arrival follow-up should a case be identified in the traveler.Now keep in mind, she has no demonstrated record of success in anything. This is a former college professor who, since taking over the CDC, has seen more Americans die of COVID than died under the last CDC director. That looks like failure.But in Washington, it's rewarded, because success and failure are not actually the measurements that matter in Washington, political loyalty is and Rochelle Walensky is a loyal Democrat.COVID-19 OMICRON VARIANT KEEPS THE WORLD JITTERYSo she's being rewarded with the powers of an intelligence agency. She’ll now be "collecting passenger information" as part of a domestic surveillance operation at major airports. There was never a vote on this. Nobody asked you whether you were for it.This is again the CDC director, who's somehow nationalized America's rental properties, she's going to be spying on you.The question really is how much longer will this country continue to tolerate this? You've got to wonder. And what happens if we keep tolerating it? We don't need to wonder about that because we've gotAustraliaas an example. Consider this from an Australian newscast this morning.

As you can see in these pictures, they've been conducting thorough searches in car boots, checking vehicle registrations, cars and busses alike.So that's not a third-world country, that's Australia, which until 20 minutes ago seemed very much like America, maybe slightly more exotic and charming, but not so different, really same culture, same language, same basis of its legal system.OMICRON: WHAT ARE THE VARIANT'S SYMPTOMS?In case you're wondering, doesn't seem like any of these escapees actually have COVID. There's no other evidence they were infecting anybody. But it didn't matter. They're supposed to be behind bars now they're not, so police set up roadblocks, checkpoints brought in the dogs. It’s a democracy. Doesn’t seem very healthy.It's not just Australia, by the way. In Austria, authorities have stopped people on the street and are demanding to see their COVID papers. InCanada, unvaccinated citizens who have been banned from planes or trains in their own country, not because they've tested positive for COVID and are infecting people, but simply because they haven't taken the injection that the prime minister demands they take. Whether or not they have natural immunity, that's irrelevant. It's about obedience. That's Canada.This is where we're heading, and we're heading there very, very fast. As theDemocratic Partycomes closer to certain defeat a year from now in the midterms, all of this will intensify. That's the whole point of it. It's how they won last time. And so they're doing it again.Omicron, not a single person is in the hospital in South Africa because of omicron. And yet that's the pretext upon which the CDC has just assumed surveillance powers.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided byRefinitiv Lipper.'Tucker Carlson Tonight' host weighs in on the latest COVID mutation.By now, you've probably heard of the terrifying newcoronavirusvariant that has left the continent ofAfricasmoldering husk of human misery. Experts are calling it the omicron variant, omicron being a Greek term that apparently means history-ending apocalypse. Even in Africa, a part of the world sadly familiar with suffering, omicron is like nothing the authorities have ever seen.Consider the nation of Botswana, a landlocked country in southern Africa about the size of France. Yesterday, officials there reported that two people may possibly have died from the omicron variant. Now it's true that many more people in Botswana died yesterday from malaria, AIDS, diarrhea, drowning car crashes, choking on peanuts, domestic disputes, agricultural accidents and also just because in the end, human beings tend to get old and die.BIDEN SAYS OMICRON VARIANT IS ‘CAUSE FOR CONCERN, NOT A CAUSE FOR PANIC’Statistically, that is a valid observation, but it does not lessen the existential terror of the rest of us feel knowing that omicron exists. No, it certainly doesn't. As the chairman of the Federal Reserve announced yesterday, thanks to Omicron and not at all due to the criminally reckless decisions that he has made personally, thanks to omicron, our economy is going to be terrible for a long time, and we're definitely going to need a lot of mail-in ballots in the coming mid-term elections for your safety, of course. And vaccines, yes, we're going to need a lot morevaccines. In addition to the two you probably already had, you're going to need a third vaccine at least. Pfizer's orders.JIM CRAMER: With the new omicron variant sweeping the globe, how do we finally put an end to this pandemic? How do we save lives and get business back to normal so everybody can put dinner on the table? Simple. The federal government needs to require vaccines, including booster shots for everyone in America by, say, January 1st. … So it’s time to admit that we have to go to war against COVID. Require vaccination universally, have the military run it. If you don’t want to get vaccinated you better be ready to prove your conscientious objector status in court. And even then you need to help in the war effort by staying home until we finally beat this thing.Yeah, have the military run it, the U.S. Army is going to force you to get your third injection. That's how serious omicron is - this from the guy who demanded you keep your money in Bear Stearns five days before it disappeared completely. So you can definitely trust what he's saying. This stuff is scary. The national media are highly upset about omicron. This is their deep concern:CNN, DR.  LEANA WEN: I believe that states and local jurisdictions and businesses that have let go of indoor mask mandates, they should bring it back as well as an additional step to protect against omicron.MSNBC REPORTER: They are preparing and preparing for the worst potentially. We heard the president urging people to go get their booster shot.CNN, RICHARD QUEST: I do see targeted lockdowns for omicron, those for the unvaccinated. I see many more restrictions being introduced for the unvaccinated, where they can go and how they can go.CNN, DR. WILLIAM SCHAFFNER: I think we may indeed be in for a phase of many more masks, much more social distancing. And more restrictions and obligations for vaccination going forward.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPWell, yeah. Look what's happening in Botswana tonight. So we're going to get more vaccines and "lockdowns" for anyone who resists getting the injection. And we're not joking this time. Omicron is here. It's a whole new pandemic.This article is adapted from Tucker Carlson's opening commentary on the November 30, 2021 edition of "Tucker Carlson Tonight."Get the recap of top opinion commentary and original content throughout the week.SubscribedYou've successfully subscribed to this newsletter!This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2022 FOX News Network, LLC.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided byRefinitiv Lipper.'Tucker Carlson Tonight' host surveys the consequences of following the White House's lead on COVID-19 management.Hope you had a great Thanksgiving. Seems like a good time to reassess the holiday season, so let's think about COVID and where we are. The first confirmed case of the coronavirus in the U.S. appeared in a blood test on January 18th, 2020. It was in the state of Washington. That was almost two years ago. How have we done since?Well, look at the numbers compared to 2019. Americans now are poorer, more isolated, more physically unhealthy, more fearful, and sadder than they have been in generations, maybe ever. Depression has skyrocketed. Church attendance has dropped in half. Cancer deaths are up dramatically; so is obesity, hypertension, diabetes, strokes among young people, suicide, drug ODs. You name it, it's up – these, in addition to countless other serious social pathologies.People are not having children, for example. Maybe most depressingly, a new study from researchers at Brown finds that children, kids born during the pandemic have, "significantly reduced verbal motor and overall cognitive performance" – en entire generation slower.So that's a legitimate public health crisis. All of these are legitimate public health crises, but you never hear about them because the attention of our leaders is focused on COVID and particularly on the COVID vaccines. More vaccines, Joe Biden has told us repeatedly, are the answer, really the only answer. By and large, Americans have followed Biden's lead. They believe the president. As of tonight, about 82% of the entire adult population of the United States has received a COVID shot. In total, more than 232 million Americans have been vaccinated as the largest inoculation campaign in our history.You hear a lot about people who've resisted the shot, but most people haven’t. In fact, more Americans have received the COVID vaccine than have a job or own a car or speak English as a first language. Effectively, pretty much everybody has had the shot. The country did what Joe Biden asked. We achieved universal vaccination.TUCKER CARLSON: HOW CAN AMERICA SURVIVE THREE MORE YEARS OF JOE BIDEN?So what are the results of this? Let's see: More Americans have died from COVID in 2021 than died in 2020, before there was a shot. There were 362,000 deaths from COVID last year. So far this year, there have been 414,000 deaths. Overall, the United States has the highest number of COVID deaths of any country on the planet by far. So we gave up everything to fight COVID – we gave up our economy, our culture, our health. We literally stopped educating our own children. We did all of this in order to lower COVID deaths. And yet COVID deaths went up anyway, and they went up dramatically.So the obvious question is, how is this working? On the basis of the most simple numbers, it's not. In fact, it looks like the greatest public policy failure of all time. How does Joe Biden explain that? What does Tony Fauci say about it or Rochelle Walensky?Well, nothing. Not a word. No one in charge has even acknowledged the magnitude of the failure. They haven't had to acknowledge it because they've created a scapegoat to take the blame for it. The scapegoat is called the unvaccinated phrase that everyone understands is essentially political. It means working-class Whites who probably voted for Trump. This is all their fault. Everything bad they did.Over the weekend, various White House officials blamed this group not simply for COVID, but for virtually everything that has gone wrong since Joe Biden has become president. And there's a lot. The collapse of the U.S. dollar, supply chain implosions, empty shelves in stores, labor shortages, even rising gas prices.Watch the White House press secretary suggest that the unvaccinated are somehow responsible for inflation:Psaki: I would note, though, that the way most Americans understand and feel and experience inflation is by cost increases, right? And they experience that as it relates, and we see what the largest impacts on cost increases are across the country, whether it's gas prices, or in some cases food prices, or a variety of issues. We know what the root causes of those are, right? Global supply chain issues. The best thing we can do as a government is to get the pandemic under control.RAND PAUL: FAUCI ACTING LIKE THE MEDIEVAL CHURCH WITH ‘I REPRESENT SCIENCE’ DECLARATIONAnd we can't get the pandemic under control until you get the shot, despite the fact that more than 80% of the entire adult population has already gotten the shot. So we printed too much money because you haven't been vaccinated, that's why the dollar is not worth as much. You wonder how long it'll be before they blame the unvaccinated for climate change. Can't be long now.So Joe Biden's campaign to lower COVID deaths has been unequivocally a failure. The numbers show that very clearly. But his campaign to demonize a group of powerless Americans to transform them into cool acts -- objects of state-sponsored hate in their own country -- that has worked amazingly well.These people are now so despised it is considered acceptable for politicians to try and kill them. In Buffalo, a state assemblyman called Pat Burke is pushing insurance companies to deny coverage to people who refuse the injection. Disobey Joe Biden, have fun dying of some preventable disease, Kulak, you deserve it!This is not just an American phenomenon, by the way, and that tells you the most. Governments around the world have decided to transfer their failures onto the tiny percentage of their populations, who, for whatever reason, don't want the injection. In Germany, they won't even help you die if you don't get the shot. Euthanasia clinics are turning away the unvaccinated. You've got to get the COVID vaccine before you commit suicide for moral reasons.Someday when the fog lifts and art returns, somebody is going to write a hilarious novel about this moment, and of course, one of the stars of it will be a nearly 81-year-old bureaucrat who really shouldn't be driving a car at this point but who somehow took control of the most powerful country on Earth and then promptly went insane.If you haven't checked in on Tony Fauci lately, you may be a little surprised to discover what he's become. If you tuned in a couple of years ago, you may recall Fauci as a conventional public health official. He wore button-down shirts. He gave careful, precise answers that suggested deep medical knowledge. No more. After two years of nonstop media adulation, Tony Fauci has morphed into an even shorter version of Benito Mussolini. Watch Fauci on television the other day refer to himself without even flinching in the third person.Margaret Brennan, host of CBS News' "Face the Nation": Well, there are a lot of Republican senators taking aim at this.Fauci: That’s ok. I'm just going to do my job and I'm going to be saving lives and they're going to be lying. There's a distinct anti-science flavor to this. So if they get up and criticize science, nobody's going to know what they're talking about. But if they get up and really aim their bullets at Tony Fauci, well, people could recognize there's a person there. So it's easy to criticize. But they're really criticizing science because I represent science.CHRIS CHRISTIE SLAMS WHITE HOUSE FOR ‘MIXED SIGNALS,’ LACK OF LEADERSHIP AMID OMICRON VARIANTWhen they criticize me, they're criticizing science. I am science, declares Tony Fauci; cience is me. So clearly something deep inside Tony Fauci has changed. The man now believes he's a deity accountable to no one. Watch Fauci blithely swat aside criticism from a sitting U.S. senator – a man who, unlike him, has been democratically elected by millions of people – by invoking Jan. 6. Watch this:Brennan: Senator Cruz told the attorney general You should be prosecuted.Fauci: Yeah, I have to laugh at that. I should be prosecuted. What happened on Jan. 6, senator?Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, takes his seat for a Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee hearing on Capitol Hill, Thursday, Nov. 4, 2021, in Washington. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)Wait a second. This is the man in charge of our COVID response. What does January 6 have to do with COVID, you ask? Well, simple: Anyone who questions Tony Fauci is, by definition, a dangerous insurrectionist.And Fauci’s not the only one who believes that. A few weeks ago, departing NIH head Francis Collins suggested that any American who doubts government COVID policy is a criminal. Collins announced that he'd like to "identify those who are purposefully spreading false information online about COVID and bring them to justice."Public health officials didn't used to talk like this. They once concerned themselves with public health. This is how they talk now, and it all might be easier to take if they were doing their core jobs effectively – if, for example, COVID deaths under Joe Biden had dropped.But again, and you can't say it loudly or often enough – deaths have not dropped. COVID deaths have risen. So you've got to wonder how long the population is going to put up with this -- unelected lunatics haranguing the rest of us as they fail at their core job. Well, the White House must be wondering very much the same thing because all of a sudden we have a brand new COVID variant to be terrified of. This new variant was discovered by the chair of the South African Medical Association, a woman called Angelique Coetzee. Here's how she describes the threat.Coetzee: Looking at the mildness of the symptoms that we are seeing, currently, there's no reason for panicking as we don't see severely ill patients.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThere's no reason to panic, it's very mild, she tells us. Very mild. We don't see very ill patients. Now, normally that would be good news for everyone. But in this country, it is cause for even deeper and more profound alarm.In the state of New York, the unelected governor has just banned all elective surgeries at hospitals because of this new variant. Now, keep in mind, there are precisely zero confirmed cases of this variant in the state of New York. But that doesn't mean you shouldn't be afraid. Oh, you should definitely be afraid. Thanks to this mild yet terrifying new variant, Joe Biden told us today you must get your third vaccine.Biden: You have to get your vaccine. You have to get the shot; you have to get the booster. Sooner or later, we're going to see cases of this new variant here in the United States. We'll have to face this new threat just as we face those that come before it.Message? Don't listen to the doctors. It's mild, it's not a problem, but that doesn't mean you can even think about relaxing. There is plenty of fear ahead, and you're going to need to listen very, very carefully to Anthony Fauci.Get all the stories you need-to-know from the most powerful name in news delivered first thing every morning to your inboxSubscribedYou've successfully subscribed to this newsletter!This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2022 FOX News Network, LLC.

The administration also instituted a vaccine mandate for essential travelers legally crossing the border – including truck drivers, emergency response workers and government officials.These new measures, allegedly designed to protect Americans from the spread of the emergingCOVID-19 omicron variant, are little more than political theater. Under current Biden administration policies, migrants detained at the southern border are only being tested for COVID if they exhibit symptoms. There is no vaccine requirement for them.That means hundreds of thousands of people are flooding into the country illegally while truck drivers are prohibited from doing their jobs unless they arevaccinated. At a time when a shortage of drivers is hobbling already crippled supply chains, Biden's new regulations have a huge down side with very little up side.BIDEN'S BORDER CRISIS – PREVENTABLE, PREDICTABLE AND DEADLYAccording to unpublished U.S. Customs and Border Protection numbers obtained by the Washington Post, border apprehensions in 2021 reached the highest levels ever recorded. And the 1.3 million people taken into custody just since President Biden took office is likely only a fraction of the total number of illegal border crossers.Among those are untold thousands of African migrants, some inevitably originating from the very countries affected by the travel ban. In 2019, when illegal migration levels were much lower, an estimated 5,000 people from 35 African nations were taken into custody trying to cross into the country illegally. Those are just the ones who were caught.CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTERSince then, the numbers of migrants have exploded. Between 2012 and 2020 the Border Patrol detained an average of 540,000 people per year. That is one-third the number apprehended this year. The most recent data show the number detained just in the month of October was 192,000 (again, a fraction of the total).How many of them were tested for COVID? How many are expected to be vaccinated?CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPBiden's policies have real economic consequences for the broader economy. Shutting down travel from other nations, checking vaccination status at the border, and mandating people inject an experimental vaccine come with a price – paid in freedom, opportunity and prosperity. People were willing to pay that price when they thought it would protect them from a deadly virus.No one can say whether travel bans and vaccine mandates would be enough to protect Americans from a new unknown variant. But we know for certain those policies won't work if they can be easily circumvented by millions of illegal border crossers putting us all at risk.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM JASON CHAFFETZJason Chaffetz is a FOX News (FNC) contributor and the host of theJason In The Housepodcast on FOX News Radio.

How afraid should I be about the new COVID-19 variant? Will I be locked down again? Will everything close down that’s being reopened? Will I catch the virus despite beingvaccinated? How sick will I get if I do?The answers are still unknown, which makes everyone even more worried, more afraid, and when we are afraid, as I wrote in my latest book, "COVID; the Politics of Fear and the Power of Science," we jump to theworst-case scenario, we over-personalize the risk, we lose the ability to reason.Politicians and the media don’t help us. Our leaders want to be perceived as acting ahead of the risk, which is why the travel advisories are being put in place even though this variant has alreadyspread into Europeand likely on into the United States, so travel restrictions now will do little.BIDEN'S BORDER CRISIS – PREVENTABLE, PREDICTABLE AND DEADLYThe WHO, which has an office in South Africa, was, as usual, late in sounding the alarm, finally calling omicron a variant of concern on Friday, when the viral horses were already out of the barn.How concerned should we be? The answer is to be found by addressing three basic scientific concerns.First, how severe is the disease that this variant causes? The answer is somewhat reassuring so far. The numbers are small, but there is as of yet no evidence that it causes more severe disease than the original virus or the delta variant. In fact, historically, as pandemic viruses evolve, they tend to become less deadly, as mutations that allow them to transmit more easily but not kill or severely sicken the host are favored.In fact, the second basic scientific concern with omicron is whether it spreads more easily than previous iterations of the virus, including delta. Time will tell whether the multitude of mutations it carries gives omicron this survival advantage. But so far, the case numbers are small, and it is too early to conclude anything on this one way or the other. Delta has predominated for months, precisely because it is far more transmissible than any of the other variants out there. Is omicron more transmissible than delta? We don’t know and we should not assume it is.Federal support to Pfizer and Moderna could speed the development of new boosters to target the omicron variant specifically.The third scientific concern concerns immune evasion. Are there so many mutations to the spike protein of this variant (more than 30) that the vaccines which target the spike protein won’t work? The answer is likely no, since the vaccine has multiple targets, but it is conceivable that the vaccine won’t protect as well against omicron as it did against the original virus and to a somewhat lesser extent, against the delta variant.This knowledge should be a big motivation for getting vaccinated if you haven’t done so and getting the booster if you have been vaccinated more than six months ago (MRNA vaccine), or more than two months ago (Johnson and Johnson). The weaker the protection turns out to be against the new variant, the more you must dial up whatever protection you can get to maximum. We should be reassured by this important tool, and we should use it.CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTERWhat should the government be doing beyond making pronouncements and pounding the drum of danger? For one thing, there is every reason to believe that cheap rapid testing helps people screen for contact with any variant including this one.It is inexcusable that almost two years into the worst pandemic in a hundred years, we still don’t have free testing in every home, provided by the federal government through a public-private partnership like Operation Warp Speed. Having a free and ready test to assure you don’t have COVID when you develop a cough, congestion or fatigue, goes a long way toward preventing panic.At the same time, federal support to Pfizer and Moderna could speed the development of new boosters to target the omicron variant specifically, a process that will take several weeks. There are also oral and nasal second-generation COVID vaccines in development that are not only easier to take but may be more successful no matter the variant.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPAnd while the monoclonal antibodies may not be as effective against omicron, there is no reason for the emerging anti-viral treatments not to be. In fact, the FDA should speed approval of the oral treatments, especially Pfizer’s Paxlovid, and the government should order much more than the 10 million courses it has already purchased and help speed delivery.Media hyperbole inflames our fears and political posturing is transparently self-serving and fails to calm us. Only science can reassure, providing context and diagnostic, preventive and treatment tools against the new variant. Our leaders must provide constant timely support for these efforts, not pound the political drum to control us.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM DR.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided byRefinitiv Lipper.Fox News contributor Karl Rove, Fox News political analyst Juan Williams and The Washington Post's Jacqueline Alemany discuss Biden's poll numbers amid new COVID and economic concerns.Americans don’t hate Joe Biden;they just think he’s incompetent. With omicron, the highly contagiousnew COVID mutationbarreling down on us, that’s not reassuring.It is also not speculation; it’s the reading from the most recent Economist/YouGov poll, which found only 17% of the nation approves strongly of Biden’s performance even as 39% like him as a person.Unhappily, nearly everything Joe Biden says and does only confirms growing doubts about his ability to intelligently lead this nation. His recent interaction with reporters during hisholiday in Nantucketwas not encouraging.BIDEN'S BORDER CRISIS – PREVENTABLE PREDICTABLE AND DEADLYAsked about the ban on flights from eight African nations, Biden explained: "And we’re -- I spent about a half hour this morning with my COVID team, led by Dr. Fauci. And so that was the decision we made."Not to nitpick, but a decision to halt flights from several nations seems consequential both diplomatically and in regards to health policy. Was half an hour sufficient to review all the options, the information we have about the new COVID strain, the logistical challenges involved and other issues? Has Biden simply handed off decision-making about national policy to Anthony Fauci?He was asked, for instance, why he didn’t impose the restrictions to take effect immediately, as EU nations have done, rather than wait a few extra days. His answer? "Well, because that was the recommendation coming from my medical team." Leaving us to wonder, what was the president’s view? Does he take any responsibility?Asked if he was worried about the "significant" sell-off in stocks that greeted news of the new COVID outbreak, Biden said he wasn’t concerned at all. When a reporter asked, "Why not?"  Biden answered, "Because why would it?"Well, maybe because, Mr. President, American investors and savers just lost hundreds of billions of dollars. And, if the stock market takes a serious hit in coming days or weeks, your approval ratings will sink even deeper into the basement, along with consumer sentiment. That would not be good for the economy, or the country, or for you.Biden cannot get out of his own way, especially on inflation, currently the nation’s top concern.Biden cannot get out of his own way, especially on inflation, currently the nation’s top concern.The day after Thanksgiving, with the nation up in arms over sky-high gasoline prices, Biden’s Interior Department released a report calling for oil and gas companies to pay more to drill on federal lands. To be clear -- hiking fees on exploration companies would lead to less drilling and ultimately less oil and gas production. What a crazy thing to propose at this particular moment.For a variety of reasons, including measures already taken by this White House, the U.S. is pumping only 11.5 million barrels of oil per day, down from nearly 13 million in 2019. That reduced output has helped give OPEC the upper hand, allowing them to push prices higher. We needmoreproduction, not less.A new YahooNews/YouGov poll shows a large majority of Americans blame Biden for higher prices at the pump, and for inflation. They are not impressed that Biden’s solution to a 50% increase in the cost of gasoline has been to beg OPEC to increase output and to release 50 million barrels of oil from our strategic petroleum reserve.They are surely not impressed that Jennifer Granholm, the secretary of Energy, seems to know little about our oil and gas industry. Asked by reporters how many barrels of oil is consumed each day in the United States – the obvious question to gauge the significance of the president tapping the SPR – she said she "didn’t have that number" in front of her.It was a defining moment for the Biden Cabinet. Americans dismayed at this display of utter ignorance can console themselves that we have the firstfemalesecretary of energy. That makes everything better.Biden has arguably flunked inflation. The White House has been totally wrong on the dimension and durability of the ongoing rise in prices. They continue to pursue massive federal spending, even though more stimulus will only add to the problem of too much money chasing too few goods. They were late to address the supply chain challenges and ineffective in their approach.COVID is our second biggest worry but could soon dominate if omicron swarms our country just as vaccines lose their potency. Americans will look to Biden for guidance on the pandemic; what will they find?CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTERThey will find a president who has needlessly politicized the pandemic, falsely accusing GOP governors of "undermining" our progress even as their states perform as well or better than blue states. A president who blamed Donald Trump for the COVID deaths on his watch, but who has now presided over more fatalities, even with effective vaccines available, than did his predecessor.They will find a White House in disarray, issuing contradictory messages about booster shots and breakthrough infections and unable to explain why, with so many Americans vaccinated or recovered from the virus, we are still at risk.A White House, in addition, that issues possibly illegal vaccine mandates while allowing hundreds of thousands of unvaccinated people to enter our country illegally, many of whom bring the virus with them.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPIf omicron brings another surge in serious COVID infections, and we surely hope it does not, Joe Biden may soon face one of the biggest challenges of his career.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided byRefinitiv Lipper.Johns Hopkins Dr. Marty Makary joins 'Fox News Primetime' with analysisThe Food and Drug Administration has just simplified things by issuing a blanket recommendation for every adult in America to get aCOVID-19vaccine booster shot.But this comes just eight weeks after the FDA’s external advisory panel voted down boosters for all adults by a 16-2 vote, due to concerns of insufficient data on younger people. So what’s the bottom line?ASTRAZENECA TRIALS SHOW ANTIBODY DRUG MORE THAN 80% EFFECTIVE AT PREVENTING COVID-19For older Americans or those who have a risk factor for COVID illness, the medical case for boosters is now compelling. A recent studyfoundthe effectiveness of the mRNA vaccine’s in protecting you from getting COVID went down dramatically from 88 percent to 48 percent at six months, and J&J’s one-dose vaccine’s effectiveness declined to 13 percent.Far more concerning, the vaccine’s effectiveness in protecting against death declined in people over 65, dropping to 76% with Moderna, 70% with Pfizer, and 52% with J&J.FILE PHOTO: Walmart pharmacist holds a vial of the Moderna coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine inside a Walmart department store in West Haven, Connecticut, U.S., February 17, 2021.(REUTERS/Mike Segar/File Photo)But everyone has a different risk tolerance level. It can be helpful to quantify the risks of a breakthrough infection using the most recent data available.According to the CDC, the risk of being hospitalized for a breakthrough infection among a person fully vaccinated is approximately 1 in 22,000 adults per week during the Delta variant. (This may or may not correspond to future risk in a post-pandemic era).The one state thatreportscharacteristics of breakthrough hospitalizations found that the average age of a fully-vaccinated person being hospitalized was 73 and the average age of a fully-vaccinated person dying was 80. That says a lot about just how skewed the risk may be in the population.FILE PHOTO: Pfizer/BioNTech's new pediatric COVID-19 vaccine vials are seen in this undated handout photo.(Pfizer/Handout via REUTERS)The decline of vaccine effectiveness against testing positive for COVID has been observed to a lesser extent in young people, but the case that young people are at increased risk of severe illness has not been established. Moreover, the reason both the FDA and CDC external experts voted down ‘boosters for all adults’ just eight weeks ago was that the side effects of a booster in younger people has not been elucidated.It is thought that the side effect profile of a third dose is similar to that of the second dose, which for young men and boys includes a 1/7,000 risk of myocarditis, including thereportedcase of at least one vaccine-related myocarditis death, a 22-year old in a Israel, a country one-38th the population size of the United States.A sign informs potential patients that "Pfizer COVID-19 Boosters Available, No Moderna" at a coronavirus disease vaccine clinic at La Colaborativa, in Chelsea, Massachusetts, U.S., November 9, 2021.    REUTERS/Brian Snyder(REUTERS/Brian Snyder)One important factor that plays into the need for a booster is natural immunity, a topic that has received little attention by public health officials despite overwhelming data. For those who have recovered from COVID, the calculus on needing a booster changes.The largest study conducted worldwide on natural immunity found that vaccinated people were 27-times more likely to get COVID than those who had previously tested positive for COVID. But it’s clear that having had COVID illness, either before or after vaccination, adds to your body’s immunity to COVID. To date, there is not scientific support for COVID boosters among people who are vaccinated and also recovered from COVID.One appeal of "boosters for all" is the simple messaging.Maine Gov. Janet Mills recently told the Washington Post that simplified requirements for booster shots would help clear up confusion with the federal recommendations.New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy said "With the holidays coming up, we need as many people boosted as possible. It’s that simple."The simple message of boosters for all may be easier to understand but it’s not supported by data.Another factor in calculating COVID mortality risk is the advent of Merck's and Pfizer’s new pills that cut COVID deaths to zero in each of their phase three clinical trials. That is, no one who received the drug in the phase three trials died.The first of these therapies, will likely be available the second week of December. These medications may mark the official end of the pandemic phase of COVID in the U.S. and a transition to the endemic phase.One looming question is will everyone need a booster each year? It’s unlikely.There is a magic number of doses at which the immune system builds up strong long-term immunity through memory B and T cells. It’s very rare for a vaccine to result in durable immunity after just one dose. It’s usually two or three. We are now recognizing that the first two mRNA doses given so close together may have resulted in them functioning as one primer dose.CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTERWith any vaccine in medicine, the longer the interval between doses, the more durable the immunity. Research now shows that spacing out the first and second vaccine doses by three months (as I did for myself) confers much stronger immunity.In fact, there is 3.5-times stronger immunity whenstudiedwith older people receiving the Pfizer vaccine. So it may be that your third dose may be the final boost needed to give you durable immunity against severe disease (the key outcome that is important).CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPFinally, the vast majority of Americans dying from COVID today (approximately 1,000 people each day) are adults with a risk factor, such as being overweight, who are unvaccinated and who did not have COVID in the past.As a reminder, anyone in that group should to go to local pharmacy today and get vaccinated in order to have protective immunity to downgrade any future COVID illness from a life-threatening infection to a non-threatening infection.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM DR.

Roger Marshall slams the Biden administration’s vaccine mandate messaging.No otherwise honorable member of the United States military should worry about losing their freedom while protecting ours.When an American service member breaks the law or military code of conduct in such an egregious way, they get slapped with a dishonorable discharge. They lose access to medical benefits from the VA, they lose access to home loans from the VA, they lose access to the GI bill for further education, they lose their Second Amendment rights and access to ammunition, they lose military funeral honors, they lose the ability to re-enlist in another branch of the military, and they have an extremely difficult time finding employment.OVER 160 HOUSE REPUBLICANS MOVE TO BLOCK BIDEN VACCINE MANDATEIn the civilian world, a dishonorable discharge is equivalent to being convicted of a felony. In fact, it may be the worst checkmark you can get in your life. Unfortunately, thousands of our servicemen and women are about to lose those very freedoms that they have fought so hard to defend asPresident Joe Biden’sCOVIDvaccine mandate is threatening them with a dishonorable discharge should they chose to not get the shot.A full honors procession honoring the centennial anniversary of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier takes place at Arlington National Cemetery on Veterans Day, in Arlington, Virginia on November 11, 2021.(Kenny Holston/Pool via REUTERS)Let me be clear, as a physician and veteran who is confident the vaccine has saved countless lives, I believe vaccinating our servicemembers against COVID-19 is an important effort. However, deep down inside I'm still a rural doctor from Great Bend, Kansas and I believe in the sanctity of the patient-physician relationship, and that every one of our situations is unique.A soldier’s clinical history is unique. There are pros and cons and there are risks and benefits of this vaccine. No doubt, each of our soldiers are using common sense, and we must respect their decisions – that includes President Biden.President Joe Biden waves as he walks to Marine One, to depart for Detroit, Michigan, from the White House on  November 17, 2021.(REUTERS/Joshua Roberts)Right now, thousands of our servicemembers are not vaccinated. In fact, in Kansas, only 58 percent of our guardsmen and women are fully or partially vaccinated. Unfortunately, the policy out of the White House says that one size has to fit all and there are no exceptions to its mandate. It refuse to consider natural immunity even though we know natural immunity to COVID is the same as, if not more powerful than the vaccine.The bottom line is, American heroes should not be treated as felons because of their personal medical choices. President Biden’s vaccine mandate is a slap in the face to so many American heroes who put their lives on the line each day to defend our freedoms and our American way of life.To protect those that are serving our country, I introduced the COVID-19 Vaccine Dishonorable Discharge Prevention Act, to prohibit the Department of Defense from dishonorably discharging American heroes who choose to not receive a COVID vaccine.Senator Marshall's Hosts Press Conference on COVID-19 Vaccine Dishonorable Discharge Prevention Act.(Official U.S. Senate photo by Renee Bouchard)I also am fighting for this as an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA).CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTERThe vaccine mandate is one of a number of highly important issues for our national security that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., has put on hold while the Democrats go back and forth on how to spend taxpayers’ money on their radical agenda instead of finalizing the National Defense Authorization Act.The annual defense bill is the only authorizing legislation that the Congress passes every year – 60 years in a row.

Nearly two years later, a cache of treatments, vaccines, and natural immunity have created an environment where the small benefit of mask-wearing no longer outweigh the risks.Yet, we continue to be told to do so.PENNSYLVANIA COURT TOSSES SCHOOL MASK MANDATE, HEALTH SECRETARY APPEALSMysophobia, also known as "germaphobia," is a type of anxiety based on the irrational fear of germs, like viruses. It is normal to be cognizant of the overall concept of good health and hygiene. When someone has mysophobia, these ordinary concerns are inflated and become disruptive to everyday life.White House Chief Medical Adviser Anthony Fauci adjusts his mask during the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions hearing on "Next Steps: The Road Ahead for the COVID-19 Response" on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., November 4, 2021. REUTERS/Elizabeth Frantz(REUTERS/Elizabeth Frantz)Just look at two of the most famous germaphobes, Howie Mandell and Howard Hughes. Howard Hughes turned to addiction to battle his severe obsessive-compulsive mysophobia and died alone in a hotel room after spending the preceding two decades in isolation avoiding germs. Howie Mandell, when asked about Howard Hughes's life of seclusion and addiction said, "I can’t tell you how many times and how close I am to that."Last year, at the height of the Covid crisis, he said he was taking medication and "moving my therapist into a whole new tax bracket" while coping with the mental health disorder in the midst of a global pandemic.Comedian Howie Mandel from the NBC series "America's Got Talent" poses for photographers at the NBCUniversal UpFront presentation in New York City, New York, U.S., May 14, 2018.  REUTERS/Mike Segar(REUTERS/Mike Segar)Howie Mandell is not alone in his struggle. One in four Americans over 18 were also suffering from a mental illness prior to the pandemic. During the pandemic, mental health services for adolescents accounted for a much larger part of all their medical claims than in the past,accordingto FAIR Health. Also, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry have together declared a national emergency regarding the dire mental health crisis amongst children as a result of isolation and remote learning during Covid-19.While the mental health consequences of prolonged avoidance of germs may be more obvious, being exposed to everyday pathogens also strengthen the immune system and may even protect kids from developing certain allergies, autoimmune disease, and asthma.HOW IS COVID GOING TO END?It’s a concept called the "hygiene hypothesis." This theory stems from observations that developing countries where kids are exposed to more pathogens tend to have lower rates of certain diseases compared to more developed nations. The problem with growing up in germ-free environments is that they fail to provide the needed exposure to germs required to stimulate the immune system.For the body to know how to fight pathogens, the immune system must be challenged so it can learn how to launch its defense when necessary. Instead, when it doesn’t undergo early exposure, the defense responses are so inadequate that they contribute to the development of disease. Perhaps this why some moms insist kids sharing bathrooms and the "5-second rule" are good things.A child reacts while receiving a dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine at Smoketown Family Wellness Center in Louisville, Kentucky, U.S., November 8, 2021. REUTERS/Jon Cherry/File Photo(REUTERS/Jon Cherry/File Photo)Yet, despitenearly 80 percentof Americans older than 12 years who have received at least one dose of a vaccine and a national testing positivity rate around 5 percent, we are still living in a self-created environment where isolation, sterilization, and mysophobia are not only normal, but encouraged. From people wearing face masks while driving alone to wiping down packages before bringing them into the home; none of this is saving lives.Children are wearing face masks in schools yet able to take them down during naps and eating as though the virus respects these boundaries. It doesn’t. The same occurs in theaters, airplanes, and restaurants. Continued unnecessary behaviors add to the mental health epidemic our nation already endures and affects our physical health. Consider as well that disposed masks have become the latest form of pollution.CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky recently tweeted that in addition to lessening the spread of Covid, "Masks also help protect from other illnesses like common cold and flu. Wearing a mask- along w/ getting vaccinated- are important steps to stay healthy."When considering the mental and physical health ramifications, that is not entirely true. We have never sought isolation or face masks to avoid the sniffles.Los Angeles County’s Director of Public Health Barbara Ferrer announced last week that mask mandates in the county are likely to remain in place into 2023. This comment comes at a time when LA county has pandemic lows in new cases, hospitalizations, and deaths with a one percent positivity rate and more than 73 percent of the population older than 12 years are vaccinated.CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTERPublic health officials are insisting face masks may be here to stay without providing science supporting their continued use or delineating metrics for removal. While the barriers continue to make sense in certain healthcare settings, as they pertain to the public, their role in the pandemic is ending. Other countries have adopted masking into everyday life as a repercussion of the first SARS outbreak.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPAmericans won’t stand for it. And they shouldn’t, given the different outcomes and potential consequences of such superfluous unremitting actions.

Instead, over the past ten months, he’s sent a damaging message to the American people: nothing is more important than the Democrat-socialist agenda. Apparently, that includes the security of our nation.In less than one month, President Biden plans on firing a significant number of intelligence officers who will not comply with hisvaccine mandate. This decision-making is beyond partisan – it’s outright dangerous.DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR TURNS ON BIDEN VACCINE MANDATE, NOT 'CORRECT' OR 'EFFECTIVE' SOLUTIONFor months, President Biden’s excessive mandates have plagued the U.S.economyand individual liberty. As a near record-high number of jobs go unfilled and workers are paid to stay home, thousands of heroic health care workers, police officers, and firefighters are being fired due to the vaccine mandates. For those who don’t find these consequences reason enough to abandon the mandates – although we can’t imagine that’s many people – there’s even worse news: this is now a national security concern.The Intelligence Community (IC) plans to enforce thevaccine mandateon its employees and contractors. And as is the case with many businesses across the country, those who refuse to get vaccinated will be fired.The specific details are classified, but the vaccination rate for some agencies is as low as 60 percent. This means that across the IC, a significant number of employees will be dismissed on the same day – December 8.As members of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, we have a unique understanding of the growing threats we face as a nation. China is increasingly aggressive toward Taiwan, testing hypersonic missiles, and conducting a brazen campaign of intellectual property theft against the United States; al Qaeda and the Taliban are greatly empowered in the wake of our disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan; Russia continues its aggression toward its neighbors; and North Korea is advancing its nuclear weapons programs.BIDEN ADMINISTRATION ASKS FEDERAL APPEALS COURT TO LIFT ORDER BLOCKING COVID-19 VACCINE MANDATEWe could go on, but our point is clear: we cannot afford a mass purging of experienced IC personnel, let alone all at once. Replacing these professionals would take between 12 and 18 months – far too long to be defending the nation with one arm tied behind our back.By weeding out those who oppose the mandates, the administration is rejecting any personnel who has legitimate concerns. This includes those who are pregnant, have natural immunities, pre-existing medical conditions that leave them vulnerable, or genuine religious apprehensions.One can also reasonably ask whether the Biden administration believes that a benefit of this policy will be to shrink a demographic within the realm of government service that the administration perceives to lean conservative.CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTERNone of this is even to mention how these employees might react to being fired over a personal medical decision. It is a legitimate concern to create significant numbers of unemployed intelligence professionals with Top Secret clearances. These officers very well may feel betrayed, angry, and underappreciated by a country they chose to protect.Last month, Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee wrote a letter to the Director of National Intelligence and Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence and Security. We expressed these concerns and asked how they might be prepared to address them. Unsurprisingly, we haven’t heard back.So, all of this begs the question: which is a bigger national security threat? Retaining those IC employees who are unvaccinated, or firing a significant number of full-performance intelligence officers amid growing threats from every single one of our foreign adversaries?CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThis question needs to be answered before December 8.The solution is clear: for the sake of personal freedom as well as our national security, President Biden should rescind the vaccine mandate.Republican Chris Stewart represents Utah’s 2nd Congressional District in the United States House of Representatives.

Rand Paul, R-Ky., on Dr. Rochelle Walensky and Dr. Anthony Fauci testifying before the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee.Dr. Anthony Faucisays that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) did not fund"gain-of-function" research in Wuhanand even if they did, the newly created superviruses are genetically too dissimilar to COVID to have caused the pandemic. The left-wing media allows this blather to accumulate without any critical analysis.First, no one, not myself or anyone I’m aware of, argues that a recombinant supervirus that has been published in scientific journals isCOVID-19or a close relative. If COVID-19 leaked from the Wuhan lab, it would be a laboratory-created virus that the Wuhan scientists have not yet, and are unlikely ever, to reveal.RAND PAUL BLASTS ANTHONY FAUCI AFTER NIH ADMITS GAIN-OF-FUNCTION FUNDINGWhat we are arguing is that the techniques that the NIH funded in Wuhan to create enhanced pathogens may also have been used to create COVID-19.Fauci’s sophistry is a straw man argument to avoid a fact that even the NIH now admits: that a recombinant virus created in the Wuhan lab and funded by the NIH did display increased lethality.One way of denying that the NIH funded gain-of-function research in Wuhan is toscrub the NIH websiteof its "gain-of-function" definition.On Oct. 20,the NIH admitted in a letterto two members of Congress that research supported by the NIH in Wuhan did create viruses that gained function or gained in lethality.On the same day, the NIH removed its previous definition of gain-of-function research from its website and replaced it with another term: "enhanced potential pandemic pathogen" research. As described on the NIH website, ePPP research refers to research "that may be reasonably anticipated to create, transfer, or use potential pandemic pathogens resulting from the enhancement of a pathogen’s transmissibility and/or virulence in humans."NIH ACKNOWLEDGES U.S. FUNDED GAIN-OF-FUNCTION RESEARCH AT WUHAN LAB DESPITE FAUCI DENIALSAnd wouldn’t you know it, the NIH letter admitting the agency-funded research that strengthened bat viruses in Wuhan makes no mention of gain-of-function research either. Rather, the letter argues that the experiments do not count as ePPP research "because these bat viruses had not been shown to infect humans."So what explains the change in terms? To avoid contradicting Dr. Fauci’s testimony that NIH does not fund gain-of-function research, the NIH is compelled to change the topic. The NIH is effectively moving the goalposts and arguing that any experiment that combines an unknown virus with a known pathogen such as theSARS coronavirus (15% mortality)is not gain of function because the experimenters do not know yet whether the recombinant virus will be enhanced.FAUCI RESISTED TRUMP DIRECTIVE TO CANCEL VIRUS RESEARCH GRANT LINKED TO WUHAN LAB: BOOKThat’s crazy! Defining away gain-of-function research by saying it doesn’t exist unless you know in advance it will occur is the very essence of hubris.So, according to the altered NIH standard, recombing any unknown bat virus with a deadly virus likeMERS (a coronavirus with mortality as high as 50%)is NOT gain-of-function research because the result is not yet known.Why so many machinations and word manipulations? Because ultimately, we’re talking about culpability here. NIH, under Dr. Fauci’s tutelage, funded research in Wuhan that used recombinant genetics to merge unknown bat coronaviruses with a known pandemic pathogen, the SARS virus.CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTERAnd Dr. Fauci still claims it isn’t "gain-of-function" research because the scientists didn’t know in advance that the newly created virus would be enhanced or more deadly.But isn’t that the very purpose of the experiment, to see if the newly created virus has gained function?Under Dr. Fauci’s convoluted definition, no experiment, no matter how deadly the combination, would be considered "gain-of-function" unless the scientists knew in advance that the combination would lead to enhanced lethality.Under Dr. Fauci’s word salad guidance no experiment combining viruses would ever be denied funding.The NIH’s old and newly altered website admits that the NIH funds "gain-of-function" research but that it needs to be "conducted in very high biosecurity laboratories." But we can’t even get to the question of whether the Wuhan lab was secure because Dr. Fauci won’t admit that "gain-of-function" research even occurred.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPFurthermore, Dr. Fauci continues to support funding for EcoHealth. Despite the possibility of a lab leak in Wuhan, in 2020 the NIH rewarded EcoHealth with a new grant, this time in the amount of$1.5 million per year for five years. Giving more taxpayer money to EcoHeath, an organization that has been less than forthcoming about what happened in Wuhan, is malpractice.The American people deserve to know how this pandemic started, to know if the NIH funded research that may have caused this pandemic, and to remove from office anyone, such as Dr. Fauci, who let this happen.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM SEN.

They are allowed more time to complete their examinations.This is an untold story of the pandemic;short and long termcognitive difficulties affecting many of all ages.STRESS FROM COVID-19 PANDEMIC CAUSING MILLENNIALS TO STRUGGLE WITH DECISION-MAKING: SURVEYAn over-told story is the rare risk of myocarditis (especially in male teens) who perhaps received too high a dose of an MRNA vaccine or received it too close together. Either way, the incidence is stillless than five per 100,000and almost all recover. Compare that to the risk of long COVID (more than 10 percent) in young people, plusmore than 150 deathsages 5 to 11 according to the CDC.These are the kind of risk/benefit analyses that take place every day in pediatricians' offices—conversations between doctor and patient and parent, where the risk of the disease is compared to the potential side effects of the treatment or vaccine.FILE PHOTO: A vial labelled with the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine is seen in this illustration picture taken March 19, 2021. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/File Photo/File Photo(REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/File Photo/)The same kind of discussion appears headed for pediatricians’ offices where young children will likely be offered the option of the Pfizer vaccine as early as next week. The doctor’s office—with a smaller needle and the familiar pediatrician as a guide—is where this conversation belongs, not at a political podium or in the news media.Dr. David Kessler, pediatrician, former FDA commissioner, current Chief Science Advisor for President Joe Biden’s COVID response team, told me in an interview last week on SiriusXM that he helped steer the process towards this important outcome.Another crucial hurdle was cleared on Tuesday when the FDA Advisory Committee, including several top Pediatric Infectious Disease experts, decided unanimously 17 (with one abstention) to recommend approval of the vaccine (at one third the adult dose) for ages 5 to 11 under an emergency use authorization.They examined the data for effectiveness (more than 90%) and safety, and determined that it passed muster. As Dr. Paul Offit, a member of the advisory committee as well as head of vaccinology and a top pediatric infectious disease specialist at the University of Pennsylvania recently told me, the committee members make their recommendation based on whether they would be willing to give the vaccine to their own child.FILE PHOTO: Pfizer/BioNTech's new pediatric COVID-19 vaccine vials are seen in this undated handout photo. Pfizer/Handout via REUTERS/File Photo(Pfizer/Handout via REUTERS/File Photo)In this case, the answer was a resounding yes, and the full FDA and the CDC, are sure to soon follow and rubber stamp the approval.Then comes the doctor’s office, sometime in early November. In the meantime, young children are spreading the virus, and though most do quite well, some don’t. In fact,thousandshave been hospitalized.The committee members make their recommendation based on whether they would be willing to give the vaccine to their own child.One of my close relatives is fully vaccinated, but he is obese and has a chronic health condition. His young child brought coronavirus home from school and he was infected. Despite being vaccinated against COVID-19, he had a few rough days of fever, fatigue, and shortness of breath.He recovered, but it occurred to me that the decision on whether to vaccinate a 5-year-old with a safe and effective vaccine in the middle of a pandemic is not just one based on assessing the risk of a bad case of COVID or a prolonged sequelae versus the much lower risk of a vaccine side effect. It's also an assessment of the risk that an infected child presents to the community at large—a risk to parents who may be at much higher risk than children are.CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTERNo child is too young to learn this central public health lesson: the only way out of this or any pandemic is to decrease the amount of circulating virus or susceptible hosts to the point where the virus has few options.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThough COVID recovery provides immunity too, the safest and most predictive way to get where we need to go is via widespread vaccination of adults and children not via widespread infection.

Ron DeSantis says his state is trying to recruit law enforcement who are 'not being treated well' from other states amid vaccine mandates.One of my kids’ favoriteseries is "Divergent."Set in a dystopian society where people are divided into "factions" based on particular virtues, the protagonist is "divergent" and does not fit neatly into one of the government’s groups. Viewed as a threat, the government is trying to rid society of the divergents by removing them from their jobs and even hunting them.Watching the film with my children, I was struck by similarities between the treatment of the divergents in the fictional series, and the treatment of divergents inPresident Biden’s America, specifically as it relates to the unconstitutional vaccine mandate. Through the mandate, President Biden is expelling independent thinkers from the ranks of the military and federal government.Those who are least likely to comply with thistyrannical mandateare those who are most likely to question decisions and offer a different perspective.WILL SWAIM: GARLAND'S ATTEMPTS TO SILENCE PARENTS NOTHING NEW FOR CALIFORNIANSThink about the whistleblowers who exposed the Internal Revenue Service’s (IRS) and Department of Justice’s (DOJ) targeting of conservative nonprofits, or the mid-level State Department employees who sent a dissent cable warning of the fall of Afghanistan.If they are removed from their positions, the only people left to advance into leadership of our agencies will be the members of the Good Ole Boys Club who all share the same liberal ideology.CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTERThe employees who turn the wheels of government aren’t elected; they don’t have to consider that their power is derived from the consent of the governed. They advance through the bowels of bureaucracy, making rules and promoting those who will make rules in the future.With this mandate, those divergent thought leaders – predominantly conservative and skeptical of big government – will self-identify via their vaccination status. That will make it easier for them to be fired or intentionally bypassed for promotions, meaning that their liberal peers will disproportionately become the rule makers in the future.Or, consider our nation’s service academies: each year, over 20,000 of the brightest students study at West Point, and the Naval, Air Force, Coast Guard and Merchant Marine Academies. They advance from lieutenants to colonels, generals and admirals. If they refuse the vaccine, though, they will never graduate, commission or go on to be the leader that they’ve trained to be. For at least four years, our military will be void of officers who are willing to think critically and stand up for the freedoms of all Americans.The problems don’t stop there.  Many who are already marching through their military career will be purged, leaving a huge imbalance in the fight against "wokeism" within the Department of Defense.President Biden, however, is not content to just rid the military of these individuals, he is seeking a dishonorable discharge that would render it impossible for officers to obtain a security clearance or serve in another government agency, such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) or local law enforcement. Make no mistake, this is by design.America won’t be safe if independent will is wiped away.On top of that, using the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) – a division of the Department of Labor – President Biden is also planning to punish private businesses and attempting to rid those companies of any divergent thinkers they employ. If the company doesn’t comply, it will be excluded from receiving any government contracts, a major financial penalty. His grasp for control knows no bounds.I won’t stand by while fellow patriots are fired over this order. If you’re an employee concerned that your vaccination status will impact your employment, head to my website,mast.house.gov/vaccinemandate.At your request, I will write to your employing agency or military branch and demand that, at the very least, it acknowledges in writing all liability for potential adverse side effects.Ultimately, the Biden administration should accept liability, not just regarding the vaccine, but for the lasting impact that purging independent thinkers will have on our nation’s leadership.We need dissenting opinions, and we need people who aren’t afraid to share them. The Biden administration doesn’t want this. As "Divergent"concluded, the tyrannical leader offered a monologue that, sadly, could’ve been included in one of President Biden’s teleprompted speeches:"We are safer when everything that makes up a person – thoughts, emotion and history – are wiped away by chemistry. The brilliance of the faction system is that conformity to the faction removes the threat of anyone exercising their independent will, and Divergents threaten that system."CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPAmerica won’t be safe if independent will is wiped away. If someone wants the vaccine, they should be able to receive it without involvement from a military branch or government agency, and those who refuse it deserve the same treatment.But this isn’t about what Americans deserve, this is about how the liberal faction is crushing the will of public servants and grabbing power in order to control government agencies for generations to come.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM REP.

This is especially true for parents of kids with pre-existing medical conditions, including obesity.As highlighted in a recent study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a real-world analysis ofCOVID-19hospitalizations among adolescents aged 12–18 years showed 72 percent of those hospitalized had at least one underlying pre-existing medical condition. Of the hospitalized, 97 percent were unvaccinated, highlighting the importance of vaccinating high-risk adolescents.PFIZER SAYS ITS COVID-19 VACCINE MORE THAN 90% EFFECTIVE IN KIDSLate Friday evening, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) published the clinical trial data on Pfizer/ BioNTech’s low dose, two-part vaccine for children ages 5-11 years, which their independent advisory committee is scheduled to meet soon to review. The CDC's own independent advisory committee will convene the following week and, if approved, the vaccine for this age group may be available at pediatricians' offices byThanksgiving, according to theWhite Houseplan unveiled earlier this week.Undoubtedly, the FDA will authorize the vaccine in this age group under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA); there is little question of that, since even early data demonstrate an ability to mount an immune response to SARS-CoV-2. However, whether the CDC will recommend a universal vaccine should be thoroughly scrutinized as this age group has the lowest severity risk for COVID-19.Worldwide data show the fatality rate in young kids (5-11 years) from COVID-19 is less than 0.008 percent. Of the over 650,000 Americans who have lost their lives from Covid, fewer than 160 have been in this age group. However, death is not the only metric when it comes to determining whether this population should be vaccinated under the EUA.Hospitalization, persistence of symptoms for less than 6 months and post-infectious Multisystem Inflammatory Disorder in Children (MIS-C) should also be considered. Each having an estimated prevalence in this age group of less than 0.5 percent, two to five percent, and 0.2 percent respectively.The fatality rate in young kids (5-11 years) from Covid-19 is less than 0.008 percent.If Pfizer produces data demonstrating the vaccine further decreases the risk of severe and chronic outcomes without subjecting them to moderate to severe adverse effects, there is little reason not to recommend vaccination in this age group. Most common adverse reactions following the vaccine were reportedly mild local reactions with 12.5 percent having high fever (101 to less than 104 degrees) and nearly 69 percent of kids reporting fatigue following the second dose -- both which may keep the children out of school.Such systemic reactions are often expected for vaccines so how much they interfere with daily activities, ability to attend school and hospital visits should be assessed compared to Covid-19 symptoms.In the recently released figures, Pfizer reports no cases of severe adverse effects of anaphylaxis, appendicitis, Bell’s palsy, myopericarditis, or MIS-C following vaccination. The data did report a single case of bilateral lower leg paresthesia (numbness/tingling) having resolved within a few days.However, as we saw with adolescents and young adults, infrequent adverse events are not always captured in trials.Because of the increased prevalence of post-vaccine myopericarditis in young adult and adolescent males as more of the population received the vaccine, albeit uncommon, places across the globe began offering alternative vaccine regimens. Such alternatives like, risk-based for those with chronic medical conditions, single doses, and even not recommending it in certain age groups.Alternatively, the United States has been inflexible with its recommendations resulting in many states even mandating the vaccine for adolescents attending school. As we move forward with evaluating data for an even lower risk group, the U.S. ought to step outside its rigid all-or-none mentality when it comes to recommending the vaccine in kids 5 to 11. Their recommendations lead to mandates and this must be taken into consideration.CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTERPfizer itself said, "The number of participants in the current clinical development program is too small to detect any potential risks of myocarditis associated with vaccination."The CDC should consider the nominal risk to healthy young children from Covid-19 and the low sample size of patients in the clinical trial when determining who should be recommended for the vaccine. It is also prudent for the CDC acknowledge the upward of 8 to 10 million children who may have natural immunity from prior infection with nominal data proving clinical benefit in this age group of vaccination post infection.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThe data from Pfizer showed no cases of COVID-19 observed in either the vaccine or the placebo group in kids with evidence of prior infection. This should have been expanded upon to determine if there was a clinical benefit to vaccination post infection. Especially given the increasing data on natural immunity, including aDuke studyshowing even kids who had asymptomatic Covid-19 had robust antibody protection at least 4 months after infection.Children have been burdened enough by top-down decisions not aligned with evidence-based research through the course of the pandemic. Any mandate that comes under the EUA for young kids will be in haste and have consequences.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FROM DR.

Just and well-established principles of international law require China fully compensate states it has wronged.For over 40 years, the U.N.’s International Law Commission studied international cases on just these principles.In 2001, the Commission captured its holdings in its "Articles on State Responsibility for Internationally Wrongful Acts."  The U.N. General Assembly,with China’s support, promptly commended this effort.  American and foreign courts have approvingly cited these standards and the Articles hundreds of times.These established international principles hold a state liable, for example, even if local officials perpetrated the wrongs.The loss of American credibility following the Afghanistan debacle heightens the urgency for an American response to foreign bad actors, and Americans should demand one.Beijing’s failure to fulfill its agreed international obligations to report promptly and honestly on Covid-19’s dangers alone justifies holding it responsible, as noted by Harvard Law School Visiting Professor James Kraska.CCP responsibility only increases for its continuing efforts to deceive the world.  If, as we believe, it recklessly engineered the virus and allowed its escape, International law provides an enforceable remedy for their evil.WHITE HOUSE MUM ON REPORTS OF CHINA TESTING NUCLEAR MISSILE, SAYS ADMIN WELCOMES ‘STIFF COMPETITION’The need to hold Beijing accountable for its misdeeds has been building for years; the CCP’s defiance of its SARS-CoV-2 responsibilities magnifies the stakes and immediacy.  As the CCP ’s economic and military might gains on the US, Beijing grows more brazen.  In recent months, a CCP-guided publication threatened Japan with nuclear annihilation and dismemberment. In violation of international obligations, Beijing accelerates efforts to extinguish Hong Kong’s freedom, militarize illegal South China Sea bases, and weaponize unfair practices to dominate trade and supply chains.The pandemic has fueled Beijing’s drive for a world suiting autocratic repression by distracting America and increasing China’s relative economic rise.  Beijing now openly prioritizes gaining the capability to cripple other states’ economies while remaining invulnerable itself.REP. GALLAGHER: THIS SHOULD BE BIDEN'S 'SPUTNIK MOMENT' ON CHINA AGGRESSIONExtensive PRC investments – for example, in its dual circulation model, Belt and Road Initiative, and sanction-proof digital Yuan – further that worrisome aim. CCP General Secretary XI has defiantly proclaimed that a wall of steel faces those in Beijing’s way.So far the democracies have not imposed costs for CCP wrongs greater than the benefits Beijing derives. Such forbearance has not slowed and may have paved Xi’s aggressive ways.Recognizing the PRC as an ill-intentioned state, the democracies should not be tolerant of wrongs that fuel its rising aggressions.  The PRC claws for such advantages.  The CCP’s SARS-CoV-2 malfeasance cannot be airily -- and foolishly -- dismissed as affecting only far-off people, isolated rocks in a distant sea, or multi-national corporations that should protect themselves.NBC FACT-CHECKS FAUCI'S FEAR THAT COLLEGE FOOTBALL GAMES WOULD BE COVID SUPER-SPREADERS: 'NEVER HAPPENED'The virus stalks our streets and cripples our economy. To this day, the CCP defies without consequence even international inquiries into Wuhan’s practices. We do not wish to see another virus wing its way from Wuhan.Diplomatic and lawful measures jointly taken with our allies hold the best prospects for achieving a measure of justice and for tempering Xi’s aggressive path.  Under the Articles and accepted international principles noted above, injured states are allowed to impose countermeasures and selectively suspend obligations to the wrongdoer until fully compensated.Such efforts should hold Beijing and, as appropriate, its state-controlled entities liable for Covid-19 wrongs and other widely recognized misdeeds, including IP theft.  Many support the U.S. and allies sanctioning CCP officials directly involved, or higher officials more generally, and curtailing visas, scientific exchanges and grants.  These are worthwhile measures, rightly pursued.Sadly, these measures alone are not proportionate to the harm the CCP has caused and do not compensate victims.  Broader diplomatic demands, international countermeasures, and legal actions are needed, as well.CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTERU.S. and international preferences granted China when it was less developed and better behaved should also be curtailed. For example, the U.S. should end its practice of granting PRC companies preferred treatment in our capital markets.  These fuel CCP plans and risk Chinese defaults endangering our economy.  PRC entities should meet the same audit and reporting standards that govern U.S. companies.Immunities granted to foreign sovereigns were not adopted to protect grossly illegal activities, such as sending deadly agents into America.  Obtaining just results could be facilitated by the Biden Administration and, as needed, by amendments that still protect legitimate sovereign discretion.Crucially, targeted investments in US and allies’ military capabilities, technological advances, export controls, strategic communications, and counters to Beijing’s anti-competitive market practices are overdue.  Beijing wants Asia and then the world to sleep-walk into Xi’s authoritarian hegemony. We should not oblige.Xi’s CCP will retaliate harshly to any corrective measures, especially substantial ones.  It will hurl unjust charges, sanction companies, and seize Americans.  Artful diplomacy can mitigate but not eliminate these costs. Beijing needs the world economy; its retaliation will be lessened if other democracies rally to this cause.Perhaps fear of trumped-up PRC retaliation will deter President Biden. The CCP may then fairly ask, if hundreds of thousands of dead fail to move America and the world, what would?  We will bear the consequences of today’s neglect.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPNo democratic state would have acted as irresponsibly as Beijing.What does Beijing’s brazen, on-going malfeasance regarding SARS-CoV-2 say about that regime’s future course? And, if we fail to act, what does that say about us?Lewis Libby is senior vice president of Hudson Institute.

Think about the stories of people quitting their jobs in protest. AnNBA star, sportscasters,airline pilots,cops, and teachers. These are all workers who are more likely to have some savings to live on as they look for new work, and marketable high level skills.But what about the low wage employee livingpaycheck to paycheck? The guy who can’t just draw down some savings to avoid taking a vaccine they don’t want?What about the woman who cleans hotel rooms and can’t afford the few weeks to look for a new job, even in a goodjob market?Take theshotor you're fired means something very different to them, it is a far more crushing mandate.STATE TROOPER EXPLAINS WHY HE TOLD LIBERAL GOVERNOR TO 'KISS MY A--' AND QUIT OVER VACCINE MANDATEAnd it isn’t just the folks above the working poor in wages who get a better shake on vaccine choice. It’s those who don’t work at all.Those living on government assistance aren’t being forced to take a vaccine they don’t want. Neither are illegal migrants flooding the Southern border.The people getting compelled to get vaccinated here are the ones who decide to wake up and go to low paying, but much needed jobs every day instead of living off of the state.Didn’t we used to encourage that?ALLISON WILLIAMS LEAVING ESPN OVER COVID VACCINE MANDATEThe only group that has suffered more and been given less than the working poor during the pandemic have been our kids. And that’s not surprising since so many in our government and media treat the working poor as if they are children.Who has to wear a mask at work all day? The lawyer? The journalist or accountant? Not on your sweet life. All-day masking is for waiters and grocery clerks, delivery men and those obnoxiously known as "the help."We’ve always had fashion and uniforms in our society that denote class. But this is the first time that the "wrong sort" aren’t even allowed to show their faces. And not all of the poor, just the ones who have jobs.It’s madness. The working poor have little to no choice about jabs and masks, and they have little to no voice in our institutions of power.This is all a symptom of the broader and growing disrespect our culture has for those with low paying jobs. We tend to think it’s all well and good if such jobs are a pathway to the middle class and homeownership, or something, but right there in the moment, that woman behind the counter gets very little respect today. And by the way, this has not always been true, I’m old enough to remember a time when one was expected to treat these workers with dignity, not use them as props for viral videos as they often are now.CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTERAt a time when we have very real labor shortages adding a vaccine and mask requirement for a person considering whether they want to go to a job for 40 hours a week to make not a whole lot more than they can get by staying home makes no sense.People need to see advantages to working, such as the chance to move up or to build a resume, they don’t need medical discouragements.The stories about professional workers with greater means sacrificing a job to defend their medical freedom are inspiring to some and infuriating to others. But at least they really do have a choice.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThe story that isn’t being told is that of the worker without the means to have much of a choice at all.

supply chain disruptions are causing enormous economic concern; the prices of oil, gasoline and groceries are all on the rise; and the Virginia governor’s race is on the verge of getting away from the Democrats. Joe Biden needs to make an abrupt change double quick.Biden’s border crisis, Biden’s crime crisis, Biden’s inflation crisis andBiden’s Afghanistan crisis– while still ongoing disasters – are getting pushed out of the headlines because the mainstream media fully supports the Biden administration and frankly, it’s getting impossible to cover it all. And, set aside for a moment the slow-moving train wreck that is the Hunter Biden conflict of interest saga.DAVID BOSSIE: MANCHIN AND SINEMA ARE NOT MODERATESThe White House must be a very difficult place to work in these days because the arrogant Biden brain trust is running out of options. Questions like "how did it get so bad so quickly" and "what can we do to stop the bleeding" are getting hard to answer.The president’s popularity is falling like a lead balloon, because, well, no one ever actually really liked Joe Biden or his policies very much – including his radical progressive base. According to a recent Quinnipiac poll, Biden’s job approval rating right now stands at 38% approve and 53% disapprove. Juxtapose these numbers with data from just two months ago, when the president’s average approval rating was 50% approve and 46% disapprove, according to Real Clear Politics.CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTERThis sudden fall from grace has been nothing short of precipitous and experts are now wondering where the bottom is for Biden. New polling indicates that on specific issues, the president’s not fairing any better. On his handling of the economy, Biden’s approval stands at 39%; on foreign policy, a paltry 34%; and on the border crisis, just 23% approve of the atrocious job Biden’s done.But all is not lost. Because this is Joe Biden’s America – where everything is political – and desperate times call for desperate measures.With the mainstream media, deep state and social media all fully Trump deranged and in Biden’s hip pocket ready to help at a moment’s notice, amazing things can happen. So, get ready for Joe Biden and Anthony Fauci to shock America. In order to stop the economic hemorrhaging and sagging poll numbers, Biden could announce we have achieved herd immunity in the fight against COVID-19 – whether it’s true or not.According to the CDC, they "are still learning how many peopleneed to be vaccinated against COVID-19 before the population can be considered protected."  In Washington-speak, this is known as giving yourself just enough wiggle room to come up with a number that suits your political needs when the time comes. And that time is coming fast.Rest assured that "Saint" Fauci will be more than ready to take to the airwaves to sell it. Forget the mandates, forget the closings, forget the masks, forget all that, Fauci will tell us with a straight face, because there’s a Democrat presidency, Democrat majority in Congress, and a fast-approaching Virginia governor’s race to save.Biden and the Democrats are finding out the hard way that the American people love freedom and individual liberty.Like Kamala Harris telling us not to trust Trump’s vaccine, like Pfizer waiting to announce its vaccine until after the 2020 election, like schools magically allowed to open when Biden became president, and like the White House’s "summer of freedom" announcement – oops – this is all politics.Biden and the Democrats are finding out the hard way that the American people love freedom and individual liberty. The left’s attempt to sell socialism and heavy-handed government mandates in the United States of America has been like trying to jam a square peg into a round hole – it just doesn’t fit.Biden’s unconstitutional mandates have created some strange political bedfellows that spell mortal danger for the Democrat’s electoral success. When ideological conservatives, hospital workers, police, pilots, the military and Black Lives Matter are all united on an issue, you are in some deep kimchi.So, one answer for team Biden is to manufacture a win over COVID-19 in order to overcome their litany of mistakes on mask-wearing confusion, collusion with teacher unions on school closing rules, and divisive vaccine mandates. The White House needs to do an about face on their COVID-19 mitigation policy failures without delay.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPWith radicals in Congress and Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., making it impossible to come to an agreement on the infrastructure and irresponsible multi-trillion-dollar socialist wish list spending bills, President Biden needs a lifeline just nine months into his presidency. Biden must find a way to undo his vaccine mandate because it’s causing a dangerous economic slowdown.Sound far-fetched? Maybe, maybe not. With Election Day in Virginia is just three weeks away, look for the White House to start their 180 degree turn soon.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM DAVID BOSSIEGet the recap of top opinion commentary and original content throughout the week.SubscribedYou've successfully subscribed to this newsletter!This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2022 FOX News Network, LLC.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided byRefinitiv Lipper.'Tucker Carlson Tonight' host sounds off on Biden's attacks on the unvaccinatedJoe Biden showed up at a construction site inIllinoislast Thursday to explain what a terrific job he's been doing. Biden's poll numbers, you may have noticed, have declined recently, not just by a little bit, but by such a dramatic margin that some prominentDemocratsare openly worried about it. The midterms are in a year.So the point of last week's appearance outsideChicagowas to remind all of us in the country that our perceptions of Biden's performance are silly and baseless. Actually, Joe Biden is a great president. He's totally aware of what's happening. He's completely on top of things. He knows exactly what he's doing and he's got your well-being at heart. Not the narrow economic interests of some soulless multinational corporation that hates America and your family. No, you! Because Joe Biden is awesome.TEXAS GOV. GREG ABBOTT BANS ‘ANY ENTITY’ FROM ENFORCING A COVID-19 MANDATEAnd to prove it. Biden talked at length about theCOVIDvaccine. His greatest achievement, he said. Now, strangely, Biden didn't say a lot about the vaccine itself. He did note that if you get the shot, you could not spread COVID to other people. And if there were doctors in the audience, they might have been confused because that is ridiculously and provably untrue. Of course, the vaccinated can spread COVID, and they do.But Biden didn't pause and dwell on the science such as it is. Instead, Biden spent virtually his entire speech attacking any American who hasn't yet gotten the shot. Now you've heard him say that a lot, but it's worth taking a closer look at what Joe Biden said last week outside Chicago. Go, look it up for yourself. It's on the C-SPAN website.As you watch it, ask yourself, has any president in our history ever talked about millions of American citizens like this? This is the way presidents talk about foreign enemies or dictators talk about enemies in their midst. It's not the way American presidents talk, or ever have. Ever, for any reason, under any circumstances. We can't think of a single example, even during the Civil War.And yet, according toJoe Biden, unvaccinated Americans are the root of this country's problems. They're destroying our economy. They are killing our people. The unvaccinated, Biden said, are solely responsible for the outbreak of the Delta variant of COVID, the outbreak that has left tens of thousands of Americans dead.AIRLINES BOWING TO A ‘PRESS RELEASE’; VAX MANDATE A ‘MIRAGE’ NOT YET ON BOOKS: WATTERSBiden noted this to the morbidly obese governor of Illinois,J.B. Pritzker, who nodded from behind his mask as if all of this was settled science. And then Joe Biden kept going. The unvaccinated are dangerous, he announced. They are diseased. They're dirty. They are unpatriotic. They are selfish. They are pathogens in human form. They have caused this deadly virus to "spread to our children, to spread throughout society."They suffer because of their absurdity and their self-inflicted suffering burdens the rest of us. They "overcrowd our hospitals" like a plague of swarming, gasping insects, they "overrun our emergency rooms and intensive care units." Americans. And as they lie, they're ventilated, dying, reaping the rewards of their own sin, these miscreants "leave no room for someone with a heart attack or in need of a cancer operation."These people get no sympathy because they're barely people. TheunvaccinatedBiden told us. Die their much-deserved deaths, but even as they die, they burdened the rest of us. That's how horrible they are. They're subhuman they’re wreckers of a nation.We're not overstating any of this, by the way. Go watch Biden's speech, it's online. The question is: once you've identified a diseased fifth column like this within the country that you run, What do you do with them? Biden got to that toward the end of his speech.JOE BIDEN:These requirements work, and as the Business Roundtable, others told me when I announced the first requirement that encourage businesses to feel they could come in and demand the same thing of their employees. More people are getting vaccinated, more lives are being saved. Let's be clear: when you see headlines and reports of mass firings and hundreds of people losing their jobs, look at the bigger story. … Over the past week we've seen American, Southwest, Alaska, JetBlue Airlines all announce requirements.Yeah, there have been mass firings, the president said. But when you see reports of mass firings of law-abiding American citizens, Joe Biden told us, what you're really seeing is progress. You should celebrate.SEATTLE RESIDENTS WILL ‘PAY THE PRICE’ AS UNVACCINATED COPS FACE TERMINATION, SAYS UNION OFFICIALThink about that. No American president has ever made a statement like that, cheering the firing of law-abiding Americans in the multitudes. But Joe Biden did. He didn't even pause. He says things like that regularly. Now that's fine if you're on Joe Biden's side, apparently.But what if Joe Biden was talking about you? What if he was talking about your livelihood, your career, the future of your family? How would you feel? We should consider that, because these are Americans he's talking about, and as we do consider that, think about what happened toair travelin America over the weekend.Southwest Airlines, you may have read this, one of our biggest carriers all but shut down on Saturday and Sunday, the airline canceled thousands of flights. It threw the nation's famously efficient system of air travel into total chaos. It's stranded countless travelers in airports. Again, you saw it on the news.The question is how did this happen? Well the official explanation came right away. It was bad weather on the eastern seaboard. There were thunderstorms. There were also unspecified issues with air traffic control and all of that together forced Southwest Airlines, alone among airlines, to cancel its flights.That's what the company Southwest Airlines claimed. They claim that in a statement to us today, a long statement. It's what many media outlets have repeated uncritically for the past two days.MSNBC'S CHRIS HAYES HIT FOR SPREADING ‘MISINFORMATION’ ABOUT MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY TREATMENTSAnd yet we can tell you it is untrue. All of that is a lie. It's not what happened. We've spoken to several people with direct knowledge of what actually did happen. We can tell you that the shutdown of Southwest Airlines over the weekend was a direct consequence - it was a reaction to - Joe Biden's vaccine mandates.It began last week when Gary Kelly who is a CEO of Southwest, sent an internal memo to his employees declaring that, per Joe Biden's directive, any Southwest employee who was not fully vaccinated by the 8th of December will be fired. Canned. Done, right before Christmas.Now, this would include not simply pilots on Southwest and flight attendants, of course, but ramp workers, mechanics, dispatchers, schedulers, ticket agents, people from the top to the very bottom. Many thousands of people.Now, some unknown but apparently large number of these people have still not been vaccinated. Why is that? Well, many of them have already recovered from COVID. They have antibodies that offer them greater protection than any vaccine ever could. That's the science. So they don't want the vaccine.Others have sincere religious objections. They object to the use of aborted fetal tissue in the development of pharmaceuticals. So they don't want it. They believe it violates their faith. Still, others have friends or co-workers or relatives who have suffered severe side effects from the vaccine, and therefore they are afraid to take it. That makes sense. Don't make fun of them. That's real.INTERNET REACTS TO FAUCI GIVING BLESSING TO CELEBRATE HALLOWEEN: ‘NO ONE ASKED HIM’And yet others are taking a stand purely on principle. They believe that in a free country, politicians should never be allowed to force citizens to submit to medical treatment they don't want. These are Americans who grew up in a country where that fact was taken for granted, everybody assumed it, and they want to preserve that country for their children. That's their motive.But whatever their various reasons, the unvaccinated employees of Southwest Airlines, the many of them, are decent, high functioning Americans, and they have watched as their own government has dismissed them out of hand as criminals for reasons that don't even make sense.Consider the argument they're hearing from Joe Biden: You must get the shot for the sake of people who've already gotten the shot because the shots don't work well enough to protect the people who've already gotten them. That's what Joe Biden and the entire American health establishment is telling them. So imagine making that argument to an airline pilot, someone whose entire job is based on logic. It is utterly bewildering to them, because it doesn't make sense. It's just too unreasonable."I've flown military jets in three different war zones," one pilot told us this weekend. "I have never lost sleep like this. The stress is beyond belief. It's dangerous." People are melting.So this weekend in protest, a large number of southwest pilots called out sick and they effectively shut down their airline. And many of them, you should know, admire the company they work for. They love Southwest Airlines, but they felt they had no choice but to do this. Nobody was standing up for them, not the United States Congress, which, by the way, has exempted itself from vaccine mandates, not even their labor union, which exists and is paid to defend them. But they're not.TAMMY BRUCE: BIDEN DIDN'T EXPECT THIS KIND OF BACKLASH TO VACCINE MANDATESSo in desperation, the pilots committed the most basic act of nonviolent civil disobedience, something we used to celebrate in this country. They stayed home. Now, at the same moment, they decided to do this, a large group of air traffic controllers apparently reached the very same conclusion. An estimated 6,000 federal air traffic controllers have not yet received the Biden mandated shot. That's nearly half of all air traffic controllers in this country. And they all, as federal employees, have until next month to submit or they will be fired. And when they are fired, our air traffic control system, which is already dangerously short-staffed, ask anyone who works in it, will stop. It will cease completely just in time for the holidays.Now, once again, the controllers union has been no help to them. And once again, the media have aligned with the BidenWhite Houseto vilify them, not as people who are being persecuted as a matter of conscience, but as criminals. So on Friday, apparently, they took action. The air traffic control headquarters in Jacksonville, Florida, known to all pilots as Jacksonville Center, shut down. This never happens. It didn't even happen when there was a fire in a Chicago air traffic control center. They managed to keep air traffic control going.But this weekend, Jacksonville Center shut down because there was simply no one to man it. There was no one there. The effects of this were profound, and they were immediate. Jacksonville Center controls the airspace in this country from Orlando to Raleigh, North Carolina, as well as far out over the Atlantic Ocean. That's some of the most crowded air routes in the world.Air traffic controllers in Atlanta watched as planes headed for South Florida, rerouted west, and wound up over the Mississippi River. That would be the world's longest detour. And for a moment, in the chaos, it became clear that Joe Biden is not the only person in this country who has power. It turns out there is a limit to how far you can push some Americans.So in that way, it might have been cast as an inspiring story - man against the machine. But the media had no interest in telling that story. In fact, some on the corporate left suggested the Southwest pilots had somehow committed what is known as an illegal job action. Illegally not showing up for work, as if politicians have a right to force Americans to labor against their will.Now, some of us had assumed that was a condition we would recognize as the textbook definition of slavery. But no, it's illegal not to work, they told us. And then at least one outlet describe what the pilots had done as "domestic terrorism." Get to work immediately wage earner or you're al Qaeda.There were more cancellations at Southwest Airlines today, no doubt there will be more to come and not just of airline flights. At least two Amtrak train routes in the Northeast were canceled over the weekend and, so was a regularly scheduled car ferry in Washington state out to the San Juan Islands. In all cases, the employees in question, who have been told to get the shot, did not show up.Were these also protests against the Biden shot mandates? We can't say for certain. It certainly wouldn't surprise us, because that's our future. Thousands and thousands of Americans, the best among us in many cases, will be stripped of their livelihoods, of their lives by the Biden White House's mandates.This is not a small thing. As of tonight, more than 50,000U.S. Marinesstill have not received the shot, as well as a large percentage of theNavy SEALteams. What will happen when these people are gone from the force? Who's going to protect this country? Who's going to protect our cities?In Seattle, to name just one example, the city is moving forward toward firing fully 40 percent of the entire police force over the Biden shot mandates. Good luck getting your emergency calls answered after that, and so on.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPOur hospitals, our schools, our national labs, scientists and researchers at Oak Ridge and Los Alamos, among others.

For the first time since August, the U.S. is now averaging under 100,000 new daily cases.No longer are the days of hopelessness and no tools in our arsenal to fight COVID. I recall the days early in thepandemicwhen all I had was oxygen, inhalers, supportive care.But now we are blessed. We have a variety of treatments andtherapeuticsthat can truly save lives even if we do see another surge of cases during the winter holidays as we fast approach Thanksgiving and Christmas.US SURGEON GENERAL: FDA LIKELY TO OK COVID-19 VACCINES IN YOUNGER KIDS AMID SCHOOL YEARThe FDA is to meet October 26 to discusspediatric vaccinationsafety and efficacy profile. In the meantime, Merck recently released data that its new antiviral pill Molnupiravir cut the risk of death and hospitalizations by 50 percent inthose with mild to moderate COVID.This is incredible. The findings were so significant Merck halted its study to submit to the FDA because they know it can save lives. This is a major advance in the fight against this illness as it can help slow the spread of disease if started early and save lives plus it can be easily prescribed by a doctor.But let's use it now. The FDA should swiftly grant EUA authorization as we still have more than 1,700 deaths across the country every day.The beauty of Merck's new drug, Molnupiravir, is that it's a pill, not an IV drug. If prescribed you would take 1 capsule twice a day for 5 days. Similar to our flu treatment, called Tamiflu, that should be started within 48 hours of symptoms for most effectiveness.There is one problem: the big price tag. It only costs Merck $17 to make a 5 day course yet charges $700. It's extremely expensive. Big Pharma knows we are desperate to save lives and end this pandemic.I hope the price is negotiated down to avoid further health inequality and racial disparity. The beauty of this drug is that it can help in managing this disease and never allowing Covid or any disease result in lockdowns, school closures, loss of jobs, and loss of life.And let's not forget the highly effective life saving monoclonal antibodies which reduce viral load and the severity of symptoms in addition to reducing the death and hospitalization rate by nearly 70 percent. If administered to high risk patients immediately after a Covid diagnosis it can reduce the risk of severe disease and death by nearly 80 percent. Remdesivir, Actemra, Decadron are all extremely useful medications to treat Covid.To keep this trend of decreasing Covid cases and deaths moving in the right direction, it's important to understand risk and know how to protect yourself. Be aware of the prevalence of Covid in your community and protect yourself with vaccination if you haven't had recent infection which provides natural immunity for an uncertain length of time.CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTERSo, let's focus on the 65 million Americans eligible to be vaccinated. Only 55 percent of Americans are fully vaccinated. Let's increase testing, continue vaccinations efforts and boosters for those eligible with Pfizer but don't worry if you've had Moderna or Johnson & Johnson like I have. Data will probably come out soon allowing a mix and match of vaccines resulting in hybrid immunity. For example, if you've had J&J and you're a female under 50, it will probably be recommended you get a Moderna or Pfizer shot as your second dose. Don't forget for most, two doses of an mRNA vaccine is extremely effective in preventing severe disease and death.Now last but not least, we can't forget about flu shots. Last year we had fewer than 1,000 deaths from the flu. Usually it's about 40k-60k deaths per year Why? because of the flu vaccine, mask use, and hand washing. The same precautionary measures used to prevent Covid apply to other diseases as well such as influenza, rhinovirus, RSV, strep, and more.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPFlu season is here. be sure to get your flu shot by the end of October. I am already diagnosing  cases of flu among my patients. You can have both Covid and flu together and that is dangerous and doubles your risk of death. But fortunately, that can easily be prevented.We are on our way to ending this pandemic. We have "flattened the curve." The surge has peaked and is now on the decline. Let's keep it that way. We certainly don't want another spike in cases over the holidays and we now have the power to prevent that through vaccination, mask use, and routine testing.Know your risk.

Fox News medical contributor Dr. Marc Siegel with insight on 'Fox & Friends.'Dr. David Oshinsky, a top medical historian at NYU Langone Health (where I am a physician), told me recently that he expects thispandemicto be most remembered not in terms of the ferocious politics that have divided us, but instead in terms of the incredible advances in biotechnology that have saved us.It is starting to look like he may beright.The actualsciencehas been astounding. Consider what we have discovered in just 18 months.First, rapid tests have been produced that can detect thecoronvirusearly on even before symptoms develop.DR. MARC SIEGEL: WHY COVID IS STILL DEFEATING USWe still need these to be made much more widely available.Second, masks have been studied in large populations and have been found to have at least a modest effect at decreasing spread, but we need them to be surgical grade or better rather than the floppy cloth masks.Third, vaccines, though overly politicized, have been found to be very effective and safe, working by messaging cells to produce the spike proteins of the virus which then provokes our immune system to respond with an array of protective cells. The genetic signaler (Messenger RNA) is generally removed from the bodyquicklyin just a few short days.TheMRNA vaccineshave been used in over a billion people already and have a huge potential upside for further viruses and pandemics.Fourth, therapeutics have evolved greatly during the pandemic. Aspirin and vitamin D have both been studied and found to be effective at decreasing risk of severe outcomes from COVID.  As Sen. Rand Paul, M.D., wrote on these pages this week, the inhaled steroid budesonide has beenstudiedand found to decrease the risk of needed acute medical care for COVID while also improving recovery time when given early in the disease.Other repurposed treatments with anti-viral properties including zinc, hydroxychloroquine, and ivermectin have been tried with some positive results, but these results have not been confirmed.Other early treatments which have received a lot of attention include convalescent plasma, which includes the antibodies strained from recovered COVID patients, and monoclonal antibodies, a synthesized version which targets the virus’s spike protein.Both of these treatments have the same goal, to neutralize as much of the virus as possible early in the course of the disease.The monoclonal antibodies appear to have a much better result, and the results of convalescent plasma unconvincing, but there is still a big shortage of the Lilly and Regeneron antibodies.CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTERThe goal of vaccines and treatments alike is to prevent the virus from getting a foothold, prevent it from ever replicating to the point where it kicks off an inflammation that effects almost every organ in the body.In this later stage we have steroids (dexamethasone) to help calm the raging process and improve the chances of survival. We also have tocilizumab, atargeted antibodywhich can help block the inflammation and decreases death from COVID when given early, and Baricitinib, an anti-inflammatory drug for Rheumatoid Arthritis that decreases therisk of dyingfrom COVID by almost 50 percent for patients on the ventilator.But in order to really block the virus from doing damage we need targeted anti-virals given very early in the course or even when someone at risk is exposed but not yet sick. There’s promising news here, too.CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTERFifth, the first drug out of the starting gates was Gilead’s remdesivir, which was developed not to fight SARS COV 2 per se, but RNA viruses in general, by interfering with viral replication.It was developed in co-ordination with the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases and was initially found to have some effect againstEbolain 2015. It is given intravenously, and multiple studies have shown that it has an effect atdecreasing severityof COVID infections, most recently demonstrating an87% reductionin hospitalization and death.But it is not a pill, so its use is limited.Sixth, the first oral drug to target SARS COV 2 directly will be Merck’s molnupiravir. In atrialof 775 patients, it decreased hospitalization by 50 percent. The results are expected to be even more dramatic if the drug is combined with rapid testing so that it may be given very early or even as a post-exposure prophylaxis in higher risk patients.This may well be thepillwe have been waiting for, though some scientists are nervous about its mechanism of causing the virus to mutate and destruct.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPCould this spread to normal cells? We need to make sure that the answer is no.The path out of the pandemic is clear; a vaccine in every arm, a free rapid test in every home, a pill to take if you are at risk of getting sick, and evolving solutions for rarer severe disease.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM DR.

The findings were announced in a scientific journal today.Therobots of the cartoonsand movies from the 1970s will be the reality of the 2020s. None of us know what the lasting effects of COVID will be, but there is one area where we can draw some conclusions:This pandemic has massively accelerated investment and developments in artificial intelligence and this will have far-reaching implications on theAmerican workforce.I saw this firsthand when I visited a factory where a company was packaging pharmaceuticals. Because of asurge in COVID infections, the factory closed to workers for a period of weeks at a time during the winter when its medicines were most needed. Remarkably, the factory kept on working without human beings on the factory floor.US ECONOMY ADDS 194K JOBS IN SEPTEMBER, MISSING ESTIMATESArtificial intelligence-enabled robots using laser 3-D printers continued to produce, store and manage the packaging process. Humans working from home could observe the factory floor by video and remote control the robots whenever they needed to get involved, which was not often. People were able to direct another set of robots to pick up the packages, label them and move them to the dock for delivery without a single human setting foot in the factory.What I saw wasn’t a scene from a science fiction movie. It is growing more and more common in factories around the world and it’s happening at a speed that has been accelerated by the onset of COVID.In the months after COVID hit, CEOs ramped up their investments in technology. This meant more than just holding meetings over video, it meant moving the ability to manage a company out of the office and into the cloud. It means huge investments in the type of artificial intelligence I saw in that pharmaceutical packaging factory.Corporate investment in AI has grown to more than $70 billion a year, up from less than $50 billion before the pandemic.Vocational education needs to move into the digital age and focus increasingly on technology skills.There are a couple big take-aways from this. First, more and more often, when you go to work either you are telling a machine what to do or a machine is telling you what to do. We need to make sure that Americans are the masters of the technology and not its slaves.Author Alec RossThis means that computer science education should not be exclusive to engineers and elites. The workers on the factory floors today tend not to be moving boxes, but operating technologies that control robots that move the boxes. In the same way that everybody studies math regardless of whether you’re going to grow up to be an accountant, and everybody studies reading and writing even if you aren’t going to grow up to be a journalist, so, too, do we need universal computer science education for our students. It also means that vocational education needs to move into the digital age and focus increasingly on technology skills.It also means that communities without super fast and affordable internet connections are getting left further behind. All these digital factories work off of cloud computing that is enabled by lightning-fast internet connections. In the same way that towns died off in the 19th century if they didn’t have a train station, towns are dying off today because they are not on the broadband highway. Businesses just won’t locate in a place with slow, expensive internet connections.CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTERThese tens of billions of dollars in artificial intelligence are not just changing work on the factory floor. It’s changing how we farm. It’s changing mining, shipping and construction.And what we thought was going to happen in five to 10 years we now see happening in two or three years because of how COVID sped up technology investment and adoption.

Finally, they promise, this will supposedly address homelessness.It’s already failing -- badly. Andpoliticiansare ignoring the results.Shelter, housing, and services already exist in Seattle, yet the city’shomelessness just keeps getting worse.City leadersrarely see their lax policies or ideological agenda as the problem. They keep throwing money at housing and refuse to take a harder line approach to the homeless people who need it. And when the subsequent (and inevitable) failure hits, they just rinse, wash and repeat. It’s happening again.FROM HOMELESS TENTS TO PENTHOUSES WITH VIEWSFox News’ Dan Springer reports Seattle city leaders spent $50 million for three expensive apartment buildings with a penthouse view in the trendy Capitol Hill neighborhood. With only 165 units, each studio costs over $300,000. That’s far higher than what typical studio apartments in the Emerald City would cost to develop. Concurrently, the city is leasing hotels to house the homeless as a way to get them off the streets immediately.Whereas Seattle leases, officials in King County, Wash. -- where Seattle is located -- are purchasing hotels shuttered by the very COVID mandates they imposed. The properties are becoming 24/7 shelters.Under Executive Dow Constantine, King County spent over $230,000,000 to purchase nine hotels, which can house just over 1,000 homeless people. That’s just under $230,000 per room and doesn’t account for the services and staffing at these shelters.Driven by an ideological belief that "affordable housing" is a human right, local leaders have largely eschewed encampment sweeps. With COVID relief dollars pouring in, they have taken advantage to pursue a housing-first approach. It has come with unintended consequences.LA TO CLOSE ANOTHER PUBLIC PARK AS HOMELESS ENCAMPMENTS, GANG VIOLENCE FORCE OUT RESIDENTS IN MAJOR CITIESThe mere possibility of a hotel room keeps many homeless on the streets, refusing services. They’re waiting for a room to become available. Anecdotally, it also appears that this policy is  attracting more homeless to the area.If this housing strategy yielded positive results, one could justify the cost instead of growing the budgets for robust addiction and mental health programs. But we’re not.The Seattle Times recently published a follow-up on an encampment sweep a year earlier. The city of Seattle removed a dangerous and growing encampment that earned the ire of neighbors. Of the 78 homeless people offered hotel rooms through a city-backed program called JustCare, 57 agreed.Part of a homeless camp in Seattle (Photo by Jason Rantz)But ten months later, the homelessweren’tin permanent housing. Twenty ended up back on the streets, unwilling to follow the hotel rules or do the work necessary to address why they’re homeless. And the program couldn’t produce results on over a dozen of their participants. Many of the homeless participantsincorrectlyassumed the hotel space was permanent. Only six of the 57 ended up in permanent housing.SEATTLE CITY COUNCIL UNANIMOUSLY SUPPORTS DECRIMINALIZING PSYCHEDELIC MUSHROOMSThe results were even worse for the homeless hotel operated by the city-backed Chief Seattle Club. Of the 111 who entered the program, only two graduated into permanent housing.Putting a homeless person into a home or hotel, merely because it fits a talking point that "housing is a human right," doesn’t address why they’re homeless. After all, they weren’t born that way.The homeless in Seattle need intense wraparound services that hold them accountable, otherwise subsidized housing will fail. It must include case management, addiction or mental health care, and job training. These programs must strictly hold the homeless accountable. Instead, programs frequently allow for drug and alcohol use; some sheltersliterally hand out the materials to get high.Generally speaking, a carrot and stick approach has been the most successful in tackling the toughest cases. But the city is disinterested.CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTERNot far from the city center things are a different story. Good luck finding a dirty tent city or any homeless and high campers at parks or playgrounds in nearby Bellevue, Wash. The city certainly has a homeless population, but unlike Seattle, leaders have empowered police to tackle the issue.When police encounter illegal homeless encampments, they’re actuallyforcedto move. Bellevue Police offer a ride to a nearby shelter, and they won’t allow public spaces to be taken over by the homeless. This strategy doesn’t just clean up the city, but it connects the homeless with much-needed resources. The ones who don’t want rules come to Seattle.Some homeless people need to be prodded to get on the right path. Seattle leaders claim "tough love" policies lack compassion.But Seattle compassion leaves the homeless living in filth, surrounded by human waste and used needles. To keep warm, the homeless start campfires that routinely rage out of control, leading to property damage, injury, anddeath. Seattle has seen over950 encampment firesbreak out this year. As our weather turns bitterly cold, this problem will get worse.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPDo local leaders change their ways when the crisis worsens and the homeless die? No. They throw even money at the issue and see no results. And when much of it comes from the federal government – bankrolled by the taxpayer in San Antonio, Texas or Tampa, Florida -- it’s tempting to try yet another progressive scheme.One might think being 16 yearsintothe city’s ‘Ten Year Plan to End Homelessness’ would be a wake-up call, but we’re still living in this Seattle nightmare.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM JASON RANTZGet the recap of top opinion commentary and original content throughout the week.SubscribedYou've successfully subscribed to this newsletter!This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2022 FOX News Network, LLC.

As a doctor, it’s disturbing to see that under this administration, the opposite has happened.New infections were four times higher this past Labor Day than they were on Labor Day 2020. More than 200,000 Americans have died of coronavirus since Joe Biden took office. This is despite the United States administering 389 million shots ofcoronavirus vaccine, with 55% of our population fully vaccinated.Faced with these facts,President Bidenhas angrily defended his record. His attitude toward Americans is aggressive and overbearing.TUCKER CARLSON: PATRON SAINT ANTHONY FAUCI HAS MADE A VERDICT ON CHRISTMASWe share the goal of wanting Americans to get vaccinated. Yet the president has explicitly blamed the unvaccinated for the enduring pandemic. His divisive approach is based on coercion, not persuasion.I practiced medicine for more than two decades. Doctors get better outcomes educating patients, not barking orders. President Biden’s own administration shares in the blame for the faltering vaccination effort.CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTERThe administration’s messaging has veered between muddled and malpractice. The start-stop guidance on vaccine approval, mask wearing, and mandates have all harmed the push to get more Americans vaccinated.I practiced medicine for more than two decades. Doctors get better outcomes educating patients, not barking orders.Vaccine hesitancy isn’t new. Coronavirus vaccines got their turn when then-Sen. Kamala Harris publicly poured doubt on a shot approved under the former administration. Presidential candidate Biden expressed the same skepticism.Yet when the administration took office, they had a winning hand. Safe and effective vaccines were being administered at a rate of a million shots every day.Mistakes by this administration began early. In April, the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention paused the Johnson & Johnson vaccine for 10 days to investigate an incredibly rare side effect of blood clots. There were 15 cases identified out of eight million shots given.The president’s message ought to be simple: vaccines work.This vaccine was important since it required just one shot and could be stored in normal refrigerators. It was the best way to provide protection for people less likely to get two shots, three weeks apart.Very little information was shared with the public, and confidence in that vaccine never recovered after the pause was lifted. Just 8% of vaccinated Americans took the single shot solution, and an untold number were put off vaccination altogether.Flip-flops by the Biden administration have led to a great sense of confusion.The mixed messaging reemerged in August, when the White House began touting a plan to give booster shots to the vaccinated. Yet before the plan could be put into action, the FDA recommended that boosters only be given to senior citizens and those in high-risk groups.CDC Director Rochelle Walensky has now endorsed booster shots for workers at high risk of exposure. The data support booster shots. The bumpy rollout of the plan means the message to the public is far from clear.Many view the CDC skeptically due to their mask guidance. On May 13, CDC said fully vaccinated people were safe to go without a mask.  In July, they backtracked and said vaccinated people need to wear masks indoors, even if only 0.05% of their county’s population tested positive for coronavirus in the previous week. Currently this covers almost the entire country.Flip-flops by the Biden administration have led to a great sense of confusion. As a result, many now simply ignore public health guidance.The new vaccine mandate on federal employees and large companies has compounded the problem. It’s entirely the wrong approach to vaccine hesitancy.For months, President Biden told Americans he wouldn’t do this. Yet when case numbers spiked to an average of 150,000 a week, the administration suddenly imposed a strict national mandate.This muddied the waters even further. The mandate created the impression that vaccinated people remain at grave risk from coronavirus. Many people now see no benefit in getting the vaccine.The president’s message ought to be simple: vaccines work.The message should also be that these vaccines are safe, effective against severe illness and death, and lead to freedom from coronavirus restrictions.If we want to see the remaining 70 million eligible Americans vaccinated against this disease, the president needs to change minds, not issue mandates.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPAbove all, the administration needs to stick to the science, even and especially when it’s not politically convenient.The Biden administration has the tools they need to fight the pandemic. The White House lacks a message beyond angry finger-pointing. We can get past this deadly pandemic if we send a clear message to the American people: vaccines work.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FROM SEN.

It is time to add a new weapon in this war and grant a similar EUA for this effective, inexpensive and widely available, therapy that has been FDA-approved for other purposes for over four decades.What is budesonide?Budesonide has been utilized for over 40 years to help treat and prevent the symptoms of asthma in even our most vulnerable members of society – premature infants. The Mayo Clinic states that budesonide "is used to help prevent the symptoms of asthma." According to WebMD, budesonide "is used to control and prevent symptoms (wheezing and shortness of breath) caused by asthma. This medication belongs to a class of drugs known as corticosteroids. It works directly in the lungs to make breathing easier by reducing the irritation and swelling of the airways."CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTERThat is exactly what we need to fight COVID-19 – a drug that works directly in the lungs. Nebulized budesonide is a steroid that targets the impacted lung tissue. This is not rocket science. Just maybe there is a simple solution to a devastating and complex virus.How has Budesonide been used to treat COVID-19?Hospital systems and clinics are generally refusing to prescribe nebulized Budesonide in the United States, even when patients’ families request it after being told their loved ones will not recover. Yet the few studies that have been conducted all concur that nebulized Budesonide is a definite treatment option and should be considered.In a July 2021 article, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) stated, "Early administration of inhaled budesonide reduced the likelihood of needing urgent medical care and reduced time to recovery after early COVID-19." In another July 2021 article titled "Antiviral Effect of Budesonide against SARS-CoV-2," the NIH stated, "In conclusion, we hereby provide evidence that budesonide can significantly reduce SARS-CoV-2 titers in vitro."Budesonide was approved in April of 2021 by the United Kingdom’s NHS to treat COVID-19 on a case-by-case basis. Joint Chief Investigator Chris Butler, a South Wales general practitioner and professor of primary care from the University of Oxford’s Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, said, "A relatively cheap, widely available drug with very few side effects helps people at higher risk of worse outcomes from COVID-19 recover quicker, stay better once they feel recovered, and improves their well-being. We therefore anticipate that medical practitioners around the world caring for people with COVID-19 in the community may wish to consider this evidence when making treatment decisions, as it should help people with COVID-19 recover quicker."Americans should not be living in fear and anxiety. This deadly virus can be treated, and treated effectively.Just because a drug has been around for four decades and no longer contributes to the bottom line does not mean it should be written off when doctors prescribe it off-label with great success.What is the FDA’s job?According to the FDA’s own mission statement, it is "responsible for advancing the public health by helping to speed innovations that make medical products more effective, safer and more affordable and by helping the public get the accurate, science-based information they need to use medical products and foods to maintain and improve their health."What exactly does it mean to "advance the public health"? With a budget of $5.9 billion, the taxpayers should be getting a lot in a pandemic! Eighteen months into this COVID-19 crisis, certainly the FDA should be providing up-to-date information to Americans that includes effective outpatient therapies as well as a proven plan of attack for hospitalized patients.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPAmericans should not be living in fear and anxiety. This deadly virus can be treated, and treated effectively.We demand that the FDA do its job and grant an EUA for nebulized budesonide (1 mg every four hours) for the treatment of COVID-19.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM SEN.

In 2020, they chose Joe Biden over Donald Trump 56-43, and in 2016 they picked Hillary Clinton 56-41.So it’s surprising that Palm Beach County is involved in such a passionate fight regarding themasking of childrenin schools.In most blue areas, where masking has long become a virtue signal instead of a safety measure, kids are masked as a matter of course. InNew York City, children must mask in school even while outdoors and even while socially distanced. There are no protests about this, no contentious public meetings. The masked side has clearly won and those who don’t want to needlessly mask their children have few options.JASON CHAFFETZ: IF BIDEN, DEMS' $3.5T CRADLE-TO-GRAVE WELFARE STATE HAPPENS HERE'S WHAT AMERICA WILL BE LIKENew York State has a blanket mask mandate for schools, no school districts can opt out, no private schools can make a different choice. But in Palm Beach, the parents are fighting and they are fighting hard.The school board meetings have become legendary affairs where emotional but very well-spoken parents bring evidence, show examples of other countries which have dropped child masking, and try to engage with a school board that is openly ignoring the will of the people.One of the more outspoken pro-mask members of the school board, ​​Alexandria Ayala, was photographed recently partying maskless in a large crowd at the swanky Breakers Palm Beach. Outrage ensued. Ayala took to Twitter to argue she still believes in masking children at school. "Vaccinated adults around other vaccinated people can go maskless. But until students are vaxxed, they need to stay masked."Of course, all data shows unvaccinated kids have an even lower risk of a poor COVID-19 outcome than vaccinated adults. It’s this exact rejection of the data that has led people like Ayala to turn masking into a political statement even though they themselves can’t maintain it.There are no off-ramps for these masking rules. No end date, no metric. It’s an ideology and no facts alter the rules.Two weeks ago, a group called The Florida Civil Rights Coalition "filed a lawsuit against the School Board of Palm Beach County, its Superintendent Michael Burke, and Board Chair Frank Barbieri Jr., on behalf of multiple parents and students in the Palm Beach County School District seeking declaratory and permanent injunctive relief against the school board’s unlawful mask mandate."Parents have had enough. There are no off-ramps for these masking rules. No end date, no metric. It’s an ideology and no facts alter the rules.It’s not just Palm Beach County either. These lawsuits are happening all over the country. With names like "Let Them Breathe" in California and "Unmask our kids" in Connecticut, parents are organizing.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided byRefinitiv Lipper.'Tucker Carlson Tonight' host discusses how the left has weaponized public healthOn Saturday, some unnamed actors in theHouse of Representativesinserted a remarkable provision into the so-called "budget reconciliation bill." Almost nobody outside Washington noticed it was there, and that’s not surprising. The bill is one of the largest in human history. It’s nearly twenty-five hundred pages long. It spends $3.5 trillion dollars. Where does that money come from? Well, it was just newly printed by the federal reserve for the occasion. The provision in question was hidden on page 168. Here’s what it says: going forward the federal government will bankrupt any company that refuses to comply withJoe Biden'svaccine mandate.Have an unvaccinated worker in your office? The fine for that will be $700,000, payable to the U.S. treasury, for each and every one of those workers. Even by Washington’s standards, that’s a lot of money. Here’s a comparison: In June, by comparison, the federal government penalized a chemical company in West Virginia, after its plant exploded, killing one employee and sending two others to the hospital. The fine, in that case, was $12,288 dollars.So there you have it, written out in black and white, the moral priorities of the Democratic Party. Killing people in a chemical plant explosion is bad. Twelve thousand dollars bad. But failing to get a Biden-mandatedCOVIDvaccine — even if you’ve already recovered from COVID and have natural immunity that is more powerful than any shot — that’s much, much worse. How much worse? It is 58 times worse than killing people in a chemical plant explosion. Democrats did the math on that and they wrote it down.COVID-19 VACCINE THIRD SHOT SIDE EFFECTS ON PAR WITH SECOND DOSE: CDC STUDYThis whole approach is a little weird if you think about it. If you really wanted to protect the public, the American people, from COVID, you’d encourage them to be healthy. Get off your phone, get outside and spend some time in nature, lose some weight. That all works. We know for a fact. It’s science. And then people with higher risk factors like older people and preexisting health probably would probably want to get the vaccine. Definitely worth it for them, they should. Everyone else could look at the numbers and assess, they can choose for themselves, as they do with every other medical decision. The federal government is not requiring you to get surgery for prostate cancer if you get it. No, you get to decide.That would be a reasonable response to COVID. It might actually improve the country, rather than destroy it. But that’s very far from what they’re doing, and the reason is politics. From the beginning of the outbreak, politicians have turned what they told us was a public health response into something that very much looks like a political campaign. And in a political campaign, the other side is your enemy. So, all of a sudden, the public has become an opponent that politicians must subdue and defeat. How do you feel about opponents you are working to subdue and defeat? You feel loathing and contempt. And that’s how they do feel. They’re not hiding it anymore. YesterdayDemocraticRep. Cindy Axne from Iowa explained her party’s response to COVID. She doesn't say anything that remarkable, it's how she says it. Listen to how she talks about her constituents. She hates them:CINDY AXNE: So now all the schools are back wanting to put mask mandates in and all of the anti-vaxxer crazies are out there with their – it’s a hot mess. … I’ll be honest, Christian right, everything under the guise while they hold a cross for God or whatever. They use it like a weapon and it’s painful to watch because they’ve weaponized religion, they’ve weaponized politics.TheChristiansare weaponizing it…notice all the abortion clinics they closed? Oh no, it was Democratic politicians who closed all the churches, actually, speaking of weaponizing public health. But you read what the congresswoman said, "the anti-vaxxer crazies… the Christians, holding a cross for God or whatever." It’s hard to remember those are human beings she’s talking about, some of the weakest human beings in our country. You’d never know they are real people because she clearly loathes them. She hates them. You hear this tone a lot from politicians, all of a sudden. A lot. It’s not sympathy, it’s certainly not empathy, it’s not even a sincere attempt to make people better or healthier. It’s hate. Here's the mayor ofNew Yorkthreatening to hurt anyone who doesn’t get the shot, whether they need it or not:DE BLASIO: Most people, the vast majority of people, even those who say I didn't want to get vaccinated make a different decision when it becomes very, very practical. So, now someone is literally looking at the possibility they won't have a paycheck for a prolonged period of time. They may even lose their job, ultimately. A lot of people are going to look at that and say, "hold up, okay, I'll get vaccinated."Oh, we’ll take your paycheck away. Punch you in the face, starve you to death, we’ll beat up your kids. Turns out if you hurt people enough, they will do exactly what you say. So that clearly works. BillDe Blasiois clearly a moron, but even he understands that. And it does work. United Airlines just announced they're firing nearly 600 people. Why are they doing that? They don't want to pay tens of millions of dollars in fines, so 600 people who had jobs last week are now unemployed with no health insurance. That’s how we’re making America healthier. Got it?NYC MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO BOOED AT GLOBAL CITIZEN LIVE CONCERTIt's not just happening at the airlines. In hospitals across the country, mass firings are now underway. Where’s theCongresson this? Good question. Meanwhile, one hospital system inNorth Carolinajust canned 175 people. Remember, this is a public health crisis we’re living through. So maybe we shouldn’t empty the hospitals of their seasoned employees. There was already nationwide a severe shortage of nurses. Hospitals are closing wings because there’s no one to staff them. Now there are fewer people. None of the people who’ve been fired will be able to collect unemployment by the way. They’re done. They're destroyed. They aren’t just punished, they’re crushed.These aren’t the CEOs of big companies. These aren’t the people who live in affluent neighborhoods. These are hourly workers. These are people the Democratic Party used to care about. These are people with absolutely no power whatsoever, who worked around sick people for the duration of a deadly pandemic. And rather than thanking them, we’re firing them, with no unemployment benefits and no health insurance. And a lot of them.In the state ofNew York, for example, the deadline for healthcare workers to get vaccinated has now passed. According to the most recent figures, 16% of the state's hospital workers -- that's 83,000 people – remain unvaccinated. Eight percent of those workers haven't gotten a single dose of the vaccine, meaning they're likely going to be fired. The question is, once again: who’s going to run the hospitals in the middle of this public health crisis? According to the new governor of New York, the state is going to use the military, then hire temp workers from the Philippines.GOP SENATORS INTRODUCE BILL TO BLOCK FEDERAL AGENCIES FROM REQUIRING COVID-19 VACCINATIONIt’s lunacy. By the way, once again, why exactly are these healthcare workers, thousands of them nationwide, refusing the COVID vaccine? That is an entirely fair question, and no one is asking it. It might be worth finding out. You can’t say they don’t understand the science. They may know about COVID and healthcare even than your average Democratic governor, considering that’s what they do for a living. They treat people with COVID every single day. It’s not like they’re uninformed. What is this exactly? It’s not a few people. It’s thousands of people. Why? No one cares. Punish them, the weakest. The weakest, now crushed.Meanwhile, as we're firing nurses and doctors, we'readmitting thousands of illegal immigrants into this country, many of them are infected with disease, including COVID. You’re not supposed to say that, because it’s some sort of slur, but it’s factually true. In fact, not only is it true, the secretary of homeland security admitted it. Here's the secretary of homeland security explaining that 20 percent of these illegal migrants have an unidentified illness.MAYORKAS: We are confronted with a population of people that, as a general matter, have a rate of illness of approximately 20%.Ok, so we’re firing healthcare workers because they won’t get the vaccine, then letting in thousands of people whose identities we can't verify, who are sick with diseases we can't always identify – including COVID – none of them are required to get the vaccine, in contrast with the nurses we just fired. That leaves our hospitals short-staffed, many more sick people coming in who will need treatment at public expense. Who’s doing this, and why? What is the point? They’re telling us healthcare workers need to be fired immediately because they’re a threat to the country? This is all happening very very quickly, and it’s happening without any medical basis whatsoever.Remember that it was just last year that Joe Biden was telling us that healthcare workers are heroes, and he was right:BIDEN: To all the doctors and nurses working in the ICU units, I hope you all know that you’re truly some of the greatest heroes this nation has seen. Take Tracy, in Massachusetts. She’s a nurse who’s been treating veterans with COVID-19. Every day she’s had to put on a hazmat suit and go to work for 12 hours, days on end.  … If it wasn’t for folks like Tracy, our own families wouldn’t have a chance to be reunited. IF you want to find a hero in America, they’re all around us. And Tracy’s one of them.I don’t often endorse things Joe Biden says, but that’s 100% right. Anyone who has ever been sick or spent any time in the hospital knows that one good nurse makes all the difference. They really are some of the best people in the country. So why are we firing thousands of them? Why is Joe Biden doing this?LIBERAL JOURNALISTS CELEBRATE YOUTUBE CENSORSHIP OF ANTI-VACCINE CONTENTAs a scientific matter, it doesn’t make any sense. Unvaccinated healthcare workers do not pose a threat to their vaccinated patients or coworkers. If you're vaccinated, you'll likely be fine. That's what the data show. That’s what they tell us day after day. Vaccinated people have a greater chance of dying from a lightning strike than they do of dying from COVID. They're also more likely to die of a bee sting, or a dog attack, or from choking to death on their food. Those are the numbers, we hear them very often.So why are unvaccinated people a threat to them? Not one person has answered that question. No one is even asking it. Why are we firing them? Why are we blaming them? Why are we in their face, attacking them, demonizing them? But no one’s pushing back, so it’s accelerating. This is coming to theBorder Patrol, as well as the entire federal government. Mass firings are likely to occur in the Border Patrol’s ranks when the federal government’s vaccine mandate is enforced later this year.It’s crazy. But if there is one sad lesson, it’s that authoritarianism is very popular with certain parts of the population. If you need evidence of that, take a look at the scene last night at the New Jersey gubernatorial debate. Read to the crowd's reaction as Phil Murphy equates not getting the COVID shot to driving drunk:MURPHY:   Saying it’s your call and governments can’t mandate a vaccine or no masking is akin to supporting drunk driving. It impacts both the person that’s driving drunk and all the rest of us. (APPLAUSE) That’s not the way we beat this.How is it like drunk driving? How do unvaccinated people hurt anybody? Hey Phil Murphy, got a second? We’ve got some time. Why don’t you explain that to us?CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPIt was just a year ago that a politician who got on stage and said that would be laughed off the stage. A politician who endorsed Firing thousands of healthcare workers, during a pandemic, calling them criminals, dehumanizing them, would be reviled. Now it gets applause. Not because "the science" changed. Science is the same. It's because our leaders realized how to leverage fear to crush their political opponents. And if that means fining dissidents $700,000 for employing someone, throwing the weakest people in our society out on the street with no unemployment and no health insurance, they'll do it.This article is adapted from Tucker Carlson's opening commentary on the Sept. 29, 2021 edition of "Tucker Carlson Tonight."Get the recap of top opinion commentary and original content throughout the week.SubscribedYou've successfully subscribed to this newsletter!This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2022 FOX News Network, LLC.

Andrew Cuomohad just won an Emmy Award and was only days away from releasing his book (which he wrote while thousands of New Yorkers were dying) "American Crisis: Leadership Lessons from the COVID-19 Pandemic."Celebrities and news personalities could not stop gushing about the self-proclaimed "Luv Guv" in print and on television.Entertainment Weekly called him "Theherothat America never realized it needed until he was on our television screens every night."He and his brother Chris spent many nights onCNNon "Cuomo Prime Time" joking about who was their mom’s favorite son, how big brother Andrew was "single and ready to mingle," and – the thing that still makes me furious to this day – joking about getting COVID tests while nursing homes were not allowed to use them to test incoming patients.JANICE DEAN: IT'S ANDREW CUOMO'S LAST DAY AS GOVERNOR. MY FIGHT WON'T STOP AFTER HE'S GONEGov. Cuomo was being celebrated on all of the major liberal news channels and there were rumors he could even replace Joe Biden on the November ticket in 2020 as the Democratic nominee for president.My, how things have changed in 365 days.Gov. Cuomo resigned in August after multiple investigations into his reckless leadership, including admitting COVID positive patients into nursing homes and covering up the number of deaths.There are reports that he enlisted his staff to help him write "American Crisis," a book that netted him a $5.1 million advance, and spent hours and taxpayer dollars using state resources to get COVID tests to close family and friends. His abuse of power also brought on accusations of sexual harassment from almost a dozen women.And although we are grateful not to see Cuomo on our televisions, the radio or the endless puff pieces in print, he still hasn’t been punished for his deadly decisions, unethical mismanagement of staff or his mistreatment of women.JANICE DEAN: CUOMO, THE MONSTER, IS FINALLY LEAVING. I THANK GOD FOR THE ANGELS WHO GAVE US STRENGTHFor myself, and thousands of families, it’s personal. A resignation is not accountability for what happened to our loved ones in New York nursing homes last spring.Andrew Cuomo’s replacement is Kathy Hochul, but New York’s new governor isn’t inspiring confidence either.New York Gov. Kathy Hochul speaks to reporters after a ceremonial swearing-in ceremony at the state Capitol, Tuesday, Aug. 24, 2021, in Albany, N.Y.(AP Photo)She has yet to reach out to any of the victims’ families or comment about the over 15,000 family members we lost after the pandemic began.Her administration has never given us answers or reasons as to why it decided to admit infected patients into long-term-care facilities for 46 days without considering the other places they could’ve brought them like the USS Comfort or Manhattan’s Javits Center.JANICE DEAN: GOOD RIDDANCE TO CUOMO'S ‘DR. KNOWS BEST’And even though the New York State Health Commissioner Dr. Howard Zucker, the man who helped write the executive order that brought the sick into places that housed our most vulnerable, has handed in his resignation, he remains on the job until further notice.We still deserve answers.One of the only people who has never forgotten us or our fight is my friend New York State Assemblyman Ron Kim. Since the Hochul administration has done nothing to help us, even acknowledged us, Kim and several other leaders and advocacy groups are trying to get things done without her.CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTEROn Wednesday, we are demanding reform and a compensation fund for victims. There need to be amendments to the state’s definition of "wrongful death" and "statute of limitations" when it comes to justice for those who were not prioritized at the beginning of the pandemic.Dee and Mickey Newman and one of their grandsons.(Courtesy Janice Dean)The "Justice for Nursing Home Victims Act" will be announced by Kim on Wednesday. It will hold the state and for-profit nursing home industries accountable for depriving our family of the protection and quality of care they deserve.The act won’t bring back our loved ones but it will make sure that what we have all experienced never happens again to another family.The members of the Cuomo administration would like us to forget the thousands of loved ones we have lost. They want us to forget how Gov. Cuomo blamed everyone else except the administration that enforced the rules.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThe actions of Gov. Cuomo’s replacement also show she too would like us to move on and ignore their death sentence that was signed last spring.But we haven’t. Not by a long shot.  And right now our voices on behalf of those we lost have never been louder. And, hopefully, what we do on Wednesday will be a big step toward justice.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FROM JANICE DEANJanice Dean joined FOX News Channel (FNC) in January 2004 where she currently serves as senior meteorologist for the network.

That's the question that Time Magazine famously asked way back in 1966 when Time Magazine mattered. The answer then and now is no, God is not dead, but a lot of the people who believed in him are dead. Turns out not so long ago this was an enthusiastically Christian country. As recently as 2009, 77% of Americans told pollsters they consider themselves to be believing Christians. Then in just 10 years, over the course of the Obama administration, that number dropped by 12 points. Over the same period, the number of atheists and self-identified non-religious people in America jumped dramatically. And that was beforeCOVID. Politicians used the pandemic across the country to close thousands of churches and throw Christians in prison for practicing their faith. There was the scene, for example, last fall inIdaho. Police arresting a congregation for singing hymns outdoors.Socially distanced hymn singing outside. So what exactly was these people's crimes? The tape of that will be studied by future generations of historians to try and figure out what was going on. What did these people do wrong? Well, they publicly affirmed their belief in a power higher than government. That’s not allowed. Fewer and fewer Americans do that – or even think to. But that does not mean, and this is the critical point, that does not mean this has become a secular country. There are no secular countries, just as there are no secular people. Everybody believes in something. All of us are born with the need to worship. The question is what?So, no, America has not lost its religion. It's just replaced its religion. What's dying is the faith that created Western civilization –Christianity. In its place is a new creed, and like all religions, it has its own sacraments, its own sacred texts. It's the cult of coronavirus.Kathy Hochul is one of the high priestesses of this new faith. She's the governor ofNew York. No, no one voted for her as governor. And that seems odd for a politician, but it's typical for a faith leader. No one voted for Jim Jones either. Yesterday, Kathy Hochul held her first service as the leader of the New York Diocese of the Corona cult. Around her neck. She wore not a cross – that's yesterday's symbol – but instead a vaccination necklace. That necklace signified to the faithful gathered that Hochul isascended to the select priesthoodof those who have taken full intravenous communion. Listen to Bishop Hochul preach.And I wear my vaccinated necklace all the time to say I'm vaccinated. All of you. Yes, I know you're vaccinated. You're the smart ones. But, you know, there's people out there who aren't listening to God, what God wants. You know this. You know who they are. I need you to be my apostles. I need you to go out and talk about it and say we owe this to each other. We love each other. Jesus taught us to love one another. And how do you show that love but to care about each other enough to say, please get vaccinated because I love you. I want you to live.ARIZONA AG: ‘THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOESN’T GET TO BE OUR NANNY' OR YOUR DOCTORHow do you show your love to one another the old way is to visit people, say, in the hospital as they died, that's no longer allowed. The new way to show your love is to get the vax. God himself wants you to take the vaccine. I need you to be my apostles, Hochul thundered. No one comes to the Father except through the shot. Sinners in the hands of an angry health care worker. At the pulpit. Kathy Hochul, not super bright as you may have noticed, seems suddenly transformed – a transfiguration if you will. Standing there, she wasn't merely a mediocre, unelected governor of a dying state with bad weather. No, Hochul was the vaccine messiah preaching the undying word of St.Anthony Fauci. Can I get an amen, ladies and gentlemen.Now, it may sound unlikely to those of you used to the older faiths, but many are joining this new church. And for $39 right now on Amazon, you, too, can buy a sterling silver necklace that declares that you have been vaccinated – literally declares it just spells out in cursive "vaccinated." There's no mistaking what an incredibly good person you are. Everyone will see it.You can also buyvaccinationbracelets and vaccination pins and vaccination earrings, vaccination shirts, vaccination socks. It's all right on Kathy Hochul’s church gift shop. Go there today. And while you're shopping, be certain to pick up a Tony Fauci prayer candle. In fact, get two. All good, decent people have more than one.For just $15 on Etsy, you can buy a patron saint of staying home prayer candle, that's a real thing. We read the reviews today. Here's one of them: "Love it! I think it may have to set up a little altar to place it on! There's a new convert. Here's another review from a woman called Kelly Hannan: "I put this in my office. I work in public health and this makes me smile every time I look at it." Of course it makes you smile, Kathy Hannan, virtue is its own reward.ANTI-VACCINE-MANDATE PROTESTORS MARCH NTC STREETS ON EVE OF ENFORCEMENT FOR HEALTH CARE WORKERSNow, for those still making the tough transition from a traditional Western religion or religion about God to this new religion, which is not about God, it's really about you and only you and more of you. And you, you, you, you, you. You can pick up a masked nativity scene online, it looks conventional, but look closely, it features Mary, Joseph and the baby Jesus, all with their faces covered as they should be, even in a manger. They're masked just like you are. In this religion of narcissism, the holiest figures look exactly like you do. That's the point. We'll reach back 2,000 years and change the appearance of historical figures to look exactly like the people in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. That's what this religion is about.And speaking of babies, you’ll want to celebrate your children's baptism by vax by purchasing a sacred text to memorialize this moment. We recommend this age-appropriate Tony Fauci coloring book. This book promises, quote, hand-illustrated coloring pages starring your quarantine dreamboat. Not surprisingly, the reviews online are glowing. Everyone loves it. With one exception, of course, there's always an apostate. The kind of person burning stakes were created for. Here’s what that nasty, nonbeliever said in the snarkiest possible way: "There's a section at the back of the book where kids color numerous pages solid black to help Dr. Fauci cover up his involvement in the pandemic." Guess we know who to report to the religious police.BIDEN ACCUSED OF ‘MOVING GOALPOSTS’ ON PERCENTAGE OF AMERICANS WHO NEED TO GET JAB TO RETURN TO NORMALFor the rest of us, though, there are Tony Fauci pins, Tony Fauci mugs, Tony Fauci Christmas ornaments. There's a cornucopia of Fauciana. It's all part of the practice of this young but growing faith. Soon the especially devout will set out on pilgrimages to Wuhan,China, where the very first miracle of pangolin to human transmission occurred. Some believe a visit to the wet market will heal them. And who are we to say that it won't? You're not going to hear Joe Biden doubting this new religion – Joe Biden is its chief apostle. He knows that the kingdom of Corona can exist right here on Earth and that it will endure forever. But first, everyone must convert. Every last person. This is an evangelical faith, it will be spread by the sword if necessary. Here's Joe Biden today:REPORTER: How many Americans need to be vaccinated before getting back to normal? Like what is the percentage, total vaccinations that have to be deployed?BIDEN: Well I think, look, I think we get the vast majority like what is going on in some industries and some schools. 97, 98%, I think we're god awful close. But I'm not the scientist, I think one thing's for certain, a quarter of the country can't go unvaccinated and us continue to not have a problem.There he is getting another shot, another. Why not? It's not just once a year, no, not for the devout. Some people take communion every day.Joe Bidenwould like to see everybody on board with this program. Everyone believing wholeheartedly in this new faith. He has called for 98% of the United States of America to convert – to get those shots. One, two, three, maybe every Sunday. That's a lot. That's a big percentage of people. For context, according to the CDC – and we looked it up today – just 92% of American 2-year-olds are vaccinated against polio. And some say polio is almost as bad as Corona.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPBut here's the difference. Fighting polio was never a religion. It was just science. The whole project was overseen by a logical little man called Jonas Salk. Jonas Salk did not wear a vaccine necklace. He created the vaccine, but it never occurred to him to make jewelry out of the cause. No one lit candles in Jonas Salk’s name. Jonas Salk’s job was to stamp out a disease, and he did that. It never occurred to him to start a cult.This article is adapted from Tucker Carlson's opening commentary on the September 27, 2021 edition of "Tucker Carlson Tonight."Get the recap of top opinion commentary and original content throughout the week.SubscribedYou've successfully subscribed to this newsletter!This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2022 FOX News Network, LLC.

While the hospital workers continue to do heroic acts of courage fighting the medical battle of COVID-19, the Dream Center is "holding down the fort" dealing with the loss of people’s quality of life due to job losses and the overalleconomic impact.According to the Brookings Institution, "More than three out of five low-income households with children reported that they had experienced an income shock due toCOVID-19. Income losses related to COVID-19 are associated with a host of material hardships, including food insecurity and difficulty paying bills."TUCKER CARLSON: THE MILITARY'S COVID VACCINE MANDATE AMOUNTS TO A POWER GRABThis city that I love is devastated by this pandemic. Many have asked us, "Why do you stay? Isn’t it a hopeless effort?" It can feel that way.However, staying in hard times has allowed us to experience the greatest demonstration of God’s love in the history of the LA Dream Center’s rich legacy.Many of the community's landmarks have been shut down during the last 18 months. The best way to explain it is like when Nehemiah assessed the damage to the structure of the city every day in the Bible. I can also relate it to Ezekiel, who visited the graveyard and was confronted with the question, "Can these dry bones live again?"One particularly disheartening trend I’ve observed during the pandemic is how many single mothers are becoming homeless. Our drive-thru food line at the Dream Center was flooded by young mothers who were first to be cut during the business closures.One day, a lady I saw many times pulled up to receive her lunch and groceries and I asked her, "Where have you been?"She apologized for not coming back but then explained that she ran out of gas and couldn’t make it to the food line.She then said something that shook me greatly: "Gas money is my rent money."I can say both confidently, and proudly, that we are literally saving lives.We rallied together a few gas cards and told her we could make sure she always had a gas card to keep the air conditioner on in her car. Day after day, she started to make it to our food line. For days on end she would tell me about her dead-end search for work, but remained hopeful that she could always be fed at the Dream Center.Out of the blue one day she made a shocking confession. She told me she had a gun in her car and was going to take her own life. She followed up by telling us, "Thank you Dream Center for taking the gun out of my hand."My team here in the Echo Park neighborhood of Los Angeles gave her hope that she would never be alone. She might have troubles, but she doesn’t have to fear losing all of the basic needs in life because the Dream Center keeps showing up, never forsaking the daily demand of meeting people’s needs.I can say both confidently, and proudly, that we are literally saving lives. We are doing it by keeping our kitchen open now for 10 hours a day for anyone to get a free meal. We’ve never been able to do that in the past.CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTERWe also have a strong relationship with local law enforcement officials who help bring people off the streets and into the Dream Center in hopes of rehabilitating them, rather than locking them up.We are currently living in the most outrageous ministry era that looks like the set of a motion picture. At the end of a day, we’re exhausted, and it often feels like we’ve served for years.We are tired and overwhelmed; but we are happy.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPIf you too are finding yourself running on fumes at times, constantly waiting for the dust to settle, I pray God grants you another day of his mercy and his supernatural strength. I pray you find reminders, as I have, that your labor is not in vain.This moment could break us, but I’m determined to press on.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided byRefinitiv Lipper.'Tucker Carlson Tonight' host accuses Biden of lying about hospitals being overrun with the unvaccinatedLast month, for those of you keeping track, theBiden administrationannounced a plan to give additional shots ofCOVIDvaccine — so-called boosters — to millions of Americans. Didn’t see that coming. But the administration never explained why it was necessary or scientifically justifiable. They never bothered. Instead, with characteristic aggression, they simply decreed it was going to happen. The new shots would go out, they informed us, no later than this week, the week of September 20, which is right now. That was the deadline.The weird thing is, it turned out, no one had told the scientists about this. Two leading vaccine experts at the FDA promptly resigned. Several more announced they were thinking of quitting. Then Biden's "COVID czar," a former Facebook board member with no medical background called Jeff Zients, assured the country "no problem, none of this is cause for alarm." People resigning in protest, no big deal.The decision to give extra COVID shots, Zeints said, was "made by and announced by the nation's leading public health officials."Really? Which leading public health officials exactly? Well, Zients didn't tell us. It’s clear something was going on here. Then last week, the entire lie unraveled completely. A panel of the FDA'svaccineexperts — actual "leading public health officials" — blew up the whole idea in a single afternoon. By a vote of 16 to 2 – not close at all — they emphatically rejected Biden’s plan for more shots. For a moment, this seemed like a rare win for science, and for public safety. That decision said a former FDA official, quote, "put the FDA back in the driver’s seat" and "maintained the FDA's scientific independence" from politicians.But just for a minute. Because in Joe Biden’s America, there is no independence from politicians. Shortly after midnight on Thursday, the college professor who Biden appointed to run the CDC, Rochelle Wolensky, simply overruled the FDA panel. She didn't cite any scientific basis for her overruling actual scientists. She just did it. And she did it because she can do it, because she’s in power and you’re not.CDC'S COVID BOOSTER SHOT REVERSAL: IS THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION FOLLOWING THE SCIENCE?You wouldn’t call that - however you might describe it - following the science. You might instead call it total corruption of public health by a political party. That’s what it is. And if you doubt it, take a look at Joe Biden’s press conference today, in which he blamed the entire COVID pandemic on people who didn’t vote for him.BIDEN: The unvaccinated also put our economicrecovery at risk, causing unease in the economy and causing unease around the kitchen table. I can imagine what's going on, the conversations this morning, a lot of parents wondering what's going to happen. What's going to happen, to those who have been vaccinated? What's going to happen? Potentially slowing economic growth, costing jobs. The refusal has cost all of us. Refusing to get vaccinated, it cost all of us. I'm moving forward to vaccination requirements wherever I can.Huh? So we don’t have enough workers because people aren’t getting vaccinated? We aren’t getting enough workers because you’re paying people not to work. Drive around America, the stores are closed because people aren’t working because the government is paying them not to work. So if you’re worried about the worker crisis, look in the mirror, pal.But let’s get to the core allegation here: The unvaccinated are somehow dangerous to the rest of the country. That’s what the president just said. Before we assess all of Biden’s claims, let’s take a quick trip back to reality. Unvaccinated people may theoretically be in danger of getting sick from COVID. Everybody’s got to make that decision personally based on your age and your health. But the unvaccinated pose precisely zero danger to anyone who has been vaccinated. None. Let’s repeat that because it’s the central point here and it’s almost ever made: If you are vaccinated against COVID-19, you face no conceivable danger whatsoever from people who have not been vaccinated. Unvaccinated people cannot hurt you. So calm down. That’s the science. If you don’t believe the science, you have embraced witchcraft and superstition. Please get a grip, and excuse yourself from any conversation about public policy. You’re too irrational to contribute to it.  Again, the vaccinated face no health threat from the unvaccinated. And the fact the president is claiming otherwise is shocking and wrong.BIDEN SAYS HE WILL GET COVID-19 BOOSTER SHOT AFTER APPROVAL FROM FDA, CDC BOSSNow to Biden’s claim that the unvaccinated are somehow destroying our hospital system. Oh, the irony, one of many. This is the same president who's allowing hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens to enter our country every single month and promising them all free health care. So the next time you show up at the emergency room and can’t get in, the next time you’re injury or illness is ignored because there aren’t enough people to serve you in the hospital, you can rest assured it’s not unvaccinated Americans who are clogging the system. It’s not. It’s the rest of the world. In just eight months, Joe Biden has done more than any president in history to wreck the American healthcare system. And yet he’s blaming it, in one of the greatest acts of political diversion ever, on people who won’t take the shot:BIDEN: But this is a pandemic of the unvaccinated. … The unvaccinated overcrowded our hospitals, overrunning emergency rooms and intensive care units, leaving no room for someone with a heart attack or a cancer operation needed to get the lifesaving care because the places where they would get that care are crowded. They are not available.Such an outrageous lie. It’s unbelievable. More than a million people coming in this year who he promised freehealth care. And he’s blaming it on people who didn’t get the shot. Many of whom have natural immunity and are less likely to get sick than a vaccinated person from COVID? What a lie.But let’s assume it’s true. Let’s assume emergency rooms and ICUs are overrun with the unvaccinated. Then why is the Biden administration forcing health care workers to quit with vaccine mandates? That’s happened across the country. Whole wards in hospitals have been shut down because of Joe Biden’s mandates. Might be nice to have more doctors and nurses around in an emergency.By the way, at this point, and it could change, emergency rooms are not overrun with COVID patients. More than 20% of inpatient beds in this country are open and available, according to HHS data from earlier this month. Intensive care units, which are supposed to be occupied as close to capacity as possible, aren't full anywhere in the country. What we do have, and it’s getting worse, is a severe staffing shortage at hospitals. And the mandates are making it much, much worse.Ask anyone inhealthcarein the state ofCalifornia. Or in any state. At one major hospital in Dallas -- the Parkland Health and Hospital System -- there's no one to bathe or turn patients anymore. They don’t have enough staff. At the University ofArkansas' medical center in Little Rock, officials have been offering $25,000 signing bonuses to new nurses -- and they're still short-staffed.So looking at that, that is a crisis. What’s Joe Biden’s answer? Fire as many nurses as possible. Because the unvaccinated, according to Joe Biden, are the root of all our problems. It’s a "pandemic of the unvaccinated."BIDEN URGES UNVACCINATED TO ‘DO THE RIGHT THING,’ AFTER CDC BOSS DEFIES PANEL OVER BOOSTER RECOMMENDATIONSThink about that: blaming regular Americans for a virus that American bureaucrats funded and theChinesemilitary created. If you don’t follow his made-up laws, laws with no precedent in all of American history, you’re the reason we’re all suffering. It’s your fault middle America. Of course it is. It’s always middle America’s fault. What a lie.And, no, it’s not just a "pandemic of the unvaccinated." That’s a lie too, it’s just not true. Vaccines do appear to lower the death rate across the population from COVID, but they certainly don’t prevent death from COVID. They don’t. Look at the CDC numbers. According to the CDC, thousands of vaccinated Americans have died so far of COVID-19. According to the CDC, about 13,000 more have been hospitalized with life-threatening COVID symptoms. Vaccinated people. It doesn’t mean the vaccine is bad or not worth taking. We’re not making that case. We’re just making the obvious scientifically justifiable observation that, no, it’s not just the unvaccinated who get sick and die from COVID. It’s not. That’s a lie.CDC DIRECTOR RECOMMENDS COVID-19 BOOSTER FOR YOUNGER AT-RISK WORKERS, DEFYING ADVISORY PANELThe Biden administration knows they’re lying. And so do their lackeys. Here’s "The View" this morning.SARA HINES: It’s still these unvaccinated people that concern me the most.ANA NAVARRO: Look at the numbers! They are not lying, these are the facts. Get your vaccine.SUNNY HOSTIN: It is surprising to me that parents across the country are still anti-vaxxers, anti-mask, anti-mandate but they are not protecting their own children…You can't just say I’m not going to take the vaccine because it’s my choice it is no longer your choice when your decisions are impacting other people.Oh, impacting other people how exactly? Damn those people for dying of COVID. When are we going to start attacking other categories of people for making unwise health choices? Someone dies of diabetes, is "The View" going to attack them for eating too many potato chips? Are we going to start yelling at people with AIDS for their bad life choices? What about hepatitis or cancer?TWO HOSTS OF ‘THE VIEW’ TEST POSITIVE FOR COVID IN MIDDLE OF SHOW, FORCED TO LEAVE BEFORE HARRIS INTERVIEWNormally we wouldn't air clips from"The View."They’re too stupid and predictable. But here’s what happened a few minutes later, which we didn’t predict:PRODUCER: I need two of you to step off for a second.JOY BEHAR: Ana and Sunny have to leave. We will tell you why in a couple of minutes. … Since this is going to be a major news story any minute now, what happened is that Sunny and Ana tested positive for COVID. No matter how hard we try, these things happen. They are a breakthrough case and they will be okay. They are vaccinated up the wazoo.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPIt’s a tease when someone gets COVID. What narcissists. But here’s the bottom line: Two hosts on "The View," both of them vaccinated, get COVID at the same time. You’re supposed to believe, makes a powerful case for forcing millions of Americans with natural immunity to get the shot at gunpoint. Really? You have to wonder, is anyone convinced by this stuff anymore?This article is adapted from Tucker Carlson's opening commentary on the September 24, 2021 edition of "Tucker Carlson Tonight."Get all the stories you need-to-know from the most powerful name in news delivered first thing every morning to your inboxSubscribedYou've successfully subscribed to this newsletter!This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2022 FOX News Network, LLC.

In one fell swoop, Biden and his bureaucrats essentially nationalized the entire health care system and private workforce while purporting to battle COVID-19.ED ROLLINS: WHY 2022 MIDTERMS COULD BE A CATASTROPHE FOR BIDENBiden’s actions include vaccine mandates for all federal employees and federal contractors, private businesses with more than 100 employees, and health care providers receiving federal dollars – but make no mistake, this is just the beginningIf left unchecked, these unlawful and intolerable mandates would essentially override the Ninth and Tenth Amendments to our Constitution, and eviscerate the most basic health care freedoms of millions of Americans.CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTERNo state should tolerate these actions, and Arizona has again led the way in fighting back against this tyranny from the federal government.President Biden claims that these actions were taken to promote public safety, but Americans are now seeing through that. These actions, along with many others the Biden administration has taken over the past eight months, are all aimed at centralizing power in Washington D.C. It is clear this scheme is an attempt to subjugate millions of Americans who have up until now, refused to bow to the Washington bureaucratic elite.As my office points out in our first-in-the-nation lawsuit, the Biden administration’s unlawful actions to mandate vaccines are but one piece of a greater series of constitutionally dubious actions: one of the greatest infringements upon individual liberties, federalism and the separation of powers that’s ever been attempted by any administration in the history of our Republic.Under our Constitution, the president is not a king who can exercise this sort of unbridled power unilaterally. And even George III wouldn’t have dreamed that he could enact such sweeping policies by royal decree alone, but that’s exactly what we are seeing with Joe Biden.What makes these actions even more dangerous is that the Biden-led executive branch remains unchecked by the Pelosi-Schumer-led legislative branch. The Progressive Left within the U.S. Congress has stood by and cheered every one of the Biden administration’s vicious attempts to circumvent the Constitution and undermine the rule of law, and diminish state sovereignty.It is now left to the states to defend our citizens against the rampant and increasing abuses we are seeing from the federal government.Additionally, Congress has introduced its own schemes to centralize power within the federal government and undermine state sovereignty and individual liberties, often under the guise of protecting certain minorities and other populations at risk.So, it is now left to the states to defend our citizens against the rampant and increasing abuses we are seeing from the federal government.What everyone must understand by now is that the Biden administration will not be appeased--it will only become more brazen in wreaking havoc on our way of life as Americans. They claim to know what is best for everyone.They insist that you will be assimilated; disagreement and dissent will be canceled. It is outrageous, illegal and un-American. That is what we are dealing with though. We must also realize that we are only eight months into a four-year term, so we cannot be saved by the bell.State attorneys general, like myself, have been leading the charge against federal overreach. We warmed up by suing the Obama administration, when the former president boasted that he could basically do anything he wanted to with a pen and a phone. Nevertheless, the Biden administration is far more dangerous to Americans because it is operating with considerably less brain power, ethics and political counterweights than any other administration we’ve seen in our nation’s history.Our Founders created the states to be the laboratories of democracy. According to the 10th Amendment, "the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people."Our Founders inherently understood that there would come a time when the states needed to push back against gross federal overreach to defend the rights of their citizens. That time is now.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPAmerica was provided with 50 possible checks against any federal government that would attempt to overturn states’ sovereignty. And the attorneys generals of this country, those of us who love and respect the freedoms that our Creator has endowed to each of us, will stand as the first and last line of defense to help preserve the balance of power in our government, and the rights of the people.None of us can be asleep at the switch.

MY FIGHT WON'T STOP AFTER HE'S GONEZucker’s resignation is significant, and something I’ve been calling for since the spring of last year. Zucker co-authored the mandate that was in place for 46 days, and he helped cover up the total number of deaths (by at least 50 percent) so no one would really know how many contracted Covid and died in their long-term care facilities. Then, it was under his watch when the order was scrubbed from the Health Department website soon after it was reversed.Zucker was also the doctor who barred nursing homes from testing the returning residents for the coronavirus. While Governor Cuomo was giving out Covid tests to his brother, other family members, and fellow lawmakers, and judges—all the while using state taxpayer resources—nursing homes were prohibited from testing incoming, possibly infected patients.Why is that important? Because the potentially sick people couldn’t be identified. Meanwhile, Governor Cuomo was giving out Covid tests like candy to friends and family.Chris Churchilldetailedall of this and more last month in the Times-Union: "An epidemiologist and special advisor to Zucker, was sent to Chris Cuomo’s home in the Hamptons to test the gubernatorial brother at a time when other New Yorkers struggled to obtain coronavirus tests. When her time wasn’t being wasted on such errands, Adams was tasked with coordinating testing issues for nursing homes and other high-risk settings."In other words, a health official who could have been working to protect one of New York’s most vulnerable populations was instead catering to the privileged brother of you-know-who. That’s just…well, it's hard to find the words to describe how awful that is. There may be no better example of Cuomo's self-serving hubris."CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTERGovernor Cuomo spoke very fondly of his "Number Two Man." Zucker was featured prominently on his "pandemic" poster which sold for $14.50 and was called "Dr. Knows Best." Zucker, too, was mentioned often in the disgraced governor’s book—which is also under investigation for (illegally) using state employees to help Cuomo write it.So, today has been a long time coming. It won’t bring back our loved ones, but it is one step closer to justice for their preventable deaths.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPI have a hunch that we’ll find out more when the state investigations finally wrap up in the next few weeks.But for now, our families take solace in Governor Kathy Hochul showing "Dr. Knows Best" the door.CLICK HERE FOR MORE FROM JANICE DEANJanice Dean joined FOX News Channel (FNC) in January 2004 where she currently serves as senior meteorologist for the network.

The U.S. has performed 615 million COVID tests since the beginning of thepandemic, top in the world, but too many of these tests haven’t been used strategically to stop spread – too many have been accompanied by a delay in results being delivered to a patient who has already spread the virus by the time they know they have it.DAVID MARCUS. THE EMMYS PROVE IT'S TIME TO DESTROY THE COVID CASTE SYSTEMAs former FDA commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb points out in his powerful new book, "Uncontrolled Spread: Why COVID-19 Crushed Us and How We Can Defeat the Next Pandemic," "The CDC couldn’t deploy a test to screen for the virus, allowing the nation to become heavily seeded with infection before it was detected. This was a historic failure that we would never overcome. …"Our system was set up well to handle singular, technology-intensive, and complex problems like developing a novel vaccine or antibody drugs. We do this better than anyone. But it faltered when we were faced with more mundane problems like manufacturing those vaccines in bulk, deploying test centers, or making nose swabs to collect respiratory samples."When we finally developed safe and effective therapeutics and vaccines that could treat or prevent infection, we couldn’t manufacture enough of them in time to supply the nation for the winter surge."To compound the error, lockdowns, business and school closures, were employed that were based on flu models designed to prevent another 1918 Spanish flu from occurring, but were not equipped to cover a much more contagious respiratory virus like SARS COV2, which spreads through small droplets and aerosols.The politics of fear and divisiveness has continued to amplify the public distrust.Closing things down not only caused tremendous physical, psychological and economic damage, but it was largely ineffective because people who were locked in close together (especially lower socioeconomic groups) still spread the virus.Once the government loses trust and credibility, due to its "inability to accurately convey the true scope of the hazard, it is difficult to re-establish this," Gottlieb wisely writes in his new book. "The lack of reliable information on COVID’s spread, and the inability of people to access testing, degraded the integrity of the response."The politics of fear and divisiveness has continued to amplify the public distrust. The solution is simpler messaging, free rapid testing in every home, and a higher rate of vaccine uptake built on more direct involvement of primary care physicians.I believe and have said for months that we primary care doctors need a supply of the vaccine in our offices to have the most effective risk/benefit discussion with vaccine hesitant patients.The vaccine was supposed to change the game, and in a little island country like Malta, with over 80% of the population fully vaccinated, it has succeeded and the country is thriving and everything is wide open, as I can attest from a recent visit.CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTERThe U.S., by contrast, is number 45 on the list of those fully vaccinated, with close to 55%, helpful, but not sufficient, as the continued high case numbers (more than 150,000 new cases per day), and deaths (more than 2,000 per day) attest.As Gottlieb presciently writes, "the vaccine was our only backstop against a relentless surge of infection in winter 2021, and we failed to amplify its timely use…"The path forward is simple. Increase vaccine uptake to over 80% of the population through additional approval of the Pfizer/BioNTech  vaccine for younger children, while improving vaccine uptake by every way possible, including local and business mandates.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPOpting out requires regular use of our other most effective tool, rapid testing, combined with earlier and more widespread use of monoclonal antibodies for proven infections, and rapid development of new anti-viral drugs that are still at least several months away.And yes, with this much virus around, wear a mask, surgical grade or better, in close quarters, whether you are vaccinated or not.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM DR.

Ask them, if you wanted to take over a country, how would you do it? And here’s the answer you’re likely to get from all of them: "Well, first you’ve got to get the most votes." They’re Americans. That’s what they believe. And they believe it because that’s how things have worked in America for hundreds of years. It’s called representative democracy. But that’s not how things work in most other places, or ever have. They don’t have a representative democracy.In most places, at most times, if you wanted to take over a country, first you had to control itsmilitary— the "guys with guns," as Mark Milley once memorably put it. The Army is essential for political control. Government dictates have no meaning without the credible threat of force to back them up. Guns are to laws what gold is to paper currency. It gives it value. Strength. In a democratic system, the military serves and protects the entire population, no matter who they vote for. That’s what democracy is. In an authoritarian system, the army is the enforcement apparatus of a specific political party. That’s the difference between the two systems.It’s worth remembering this, given we’re seeing happen all around the world right now. TheGermanDefense Ministry just announced it's dismantling its best-trained special operations unit, which is called the KSK. Dozens of KSK operators have been fired. None of them committed any kind of crime. The ruling party simply determined they weren’t loyal enough. They had the wrong political views. So they got canned. As the German defense minister, put it, the KSK has "come under the influence of an unhealthy understanding of elites."AP REPORTER MOCKED FOR CALLING BIDEN ADMINISTRATION SETBACKS ‘UNCONTROLLABLE EVENTS’"An unhealthy understanding of the elites," says the elite. Has there ever been a more revealing quote than that? In other words: "Anyone who doesn’t think we’re impressive must be fired immediately." Sound familiar? It’s not just happening in Germany. In Australia, which until recently was a free country, politicians just called in the military to enforce their totalitarianCOVIDrestrictions, using violence if necessary. And it is sometimes necessary. Sydney is under martial law. Now, that is a shocking attack on the Western understanding of civil liberties, the most basic civil liberties. But the Australian government, most of its media, and its intellectual class refuse to acknowledge that. Instead, they insist that the real threat to Australia is "white supremacy." Once again, sound familiar? It goes without saying that none of this has anything to do with COVID or racism, obviously. It’s about power. That’s all it’s about.In this country, the slide from democracy began earlier this year, just afterJoe Biden’sinauguration. The newDefense Secretary, a defense industry shill called Lloyd Austin, explained that his very first and most pressing job was rooting out what he referred to as "extremism" in the U.S. military. He put the entire military on hold to do this. The question is: What is this "extremism"? What does it consist of? But Lloyd Austin never told us. And yet, if you want to know the answer, you’ll notice how very excited members of one specific political party were when they heard this news:SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH, MSNBC MARCH 18: We absolutely need to look at any type of white supremacists that are still members of the military and how they are being targeted for recruitment by whites supremacists groups and we need to weed this out. … This whole idea of a police officer on police officer violence with those officers who have been turned by white extremists is really scary to me. And I know it's got to be scary for the other police officers.SEN. MAZIE HIRONO, MARCH 9: I am considering legislation to create a standalone punitive article in the Uniform Code of Military Justice to address violent extremism in the ranks and to send a message of deterrence, that this kind of conduct will not be tolerated in the military.REP DEBBIE WASSERMAN-SCHULTZ, MARCH 12: We've seen a lot of reports highlighting how many of the attackers were veterans. And there's been really a growing recognition that the military has to do more to address extremism in its ranks."White supremacy in the military is a crisis!" said the most unscrupulous people in Washington. That, in fact, was a power grab. "No one who does not support our political party is allowed to bear arms." That’s what they’re saying very clearly. And, because it’s theDemocratic Partywe’re talking about here, there’s also, needless to say, a vicious racial angle too. There always is. Rep. Steve Cohen of Tennessee explained it:REP STEVE COHEN: The Guard is 90 some odd% I believe male, only about 20% of white males voted for Biden. You have to figure that the guard which is predominantly more conservative and I see that on my social media, and we know it, there are probably not more than 25% of the people there protecting us that voted for Biden, the other 75% are in the class that would be the large class of folks who might want to do something.So if you’re White, you’re dangerous, says a sitting member ofCongress. That was from January, the same month that Lloyd Austin announced he was cracking down on "extremism" in the military. A few months later, reading from the same song sheet,Mark Milleytold Congress he wanted to root out "White rage" in the military.MILLEY'S CHINA SCANDAL INDICATIVE OF CIVILIAN OVERSIGHT OF THE MILITARY BECOMING ‘ABUSE: COL. MACGREGORYet after all that, because we’re keeping score, to this day, we're not aware of a single White supremacist on active duty who’s been discovered by thePentagonand fired. Not one. That threat didn’t exist at all. It was fake. It was all a lie. Several National Guard troops were relieved of duty around Inauguration Day, although no one ever explained why they were fired. Then, a senior commander in the Space Force, Lt. Col. Matthew Lohmeier, also lost his job. Now, we know why. His crime was criticizing Marxism. That’s a firing offense now.Then, in August, Lloyd Austin came up with a new political purity test, one designed to separate the obedient from the free – can't have any of the latter category. Austin said he planned to fire anyone in the entire armed services who won’t submit to the COVID-19vaccinationshot. It didn’t matter whether they had natural immunity or not, as so many in the military do. Their personal moral or religious objections were totally irrelevant. The point was to bow before his authority and the authority of the Democratic Party. No excuses or exceptions. "I have determined," Austin said, "that mandatory vaccination against COVID-19 is necessary to protect the Force and defend the American people." Period. No debate.CRUZ SLAMS BIDEN'S ‘UNCONSTITUTIONAL’ VACCINE MANDATE: 'THEY WANT TO CHANGE THE TOPIC FROM AFGHANISTANSo what’s the scientific justification for this? Well, of course, there isn’t any. The fighting strength of the military is young, healthy people, virtually all of them at extremely low risk of dying fromCOVID. In fact, to this day, only 46 members of the entire U.S. military have died from the coronavirus, over the last year and a half. Suicides kill many, many more. In just a few months last year, 156 service members killed themselves.Military suicide is an actual crisis the Pentagon might want to address. Lloyd Austin might want to look into that. But no. That would get the Democratic Party nothing. The point of mandatory vaccination is to identify the sincereChristiansin the ranks, the free thinkers, the men with high testosterone levels, and anyone else who doesn’t love Joe Biden, and make them leave immediately. It’s a takeover of the U.S. military.This is how they’re doing it: We just obtained a PowerPoint that the Army is using to justify mandatory vaccines to the troops. In it, is the sympathetic portrayal of Satanism. "How many children were sacrificed to Satan because of the vaccine," the slide reads, apparently sarcastically. The presentation then proceeds to list the so-called "tenants of Satanism," which are taken straight from the "temple of Satanism" website.TIMES SQUARE SWARMED BY HUNDREDS PROTESTING COVID VACCINE MANDATE, CHANTING ‘F--- JOE BIDEN’So here you have the U.S. Army doing PR for Satanism. The rest of the presentation is less shocking but utterly shoddy and dishonest. For example, it falsely claims that only three people have died from taking the COVID vaccine. Reports collected by the Biden administration indicate that number is actually in the thousands. We called the Army about this today. They conceded the PowerPoint is real, troops saw it, but it was somehow "not approved by army leadership." They did not explain how that works, or what they’re going to do about it.We do know the vaccine mandate is taking a terrible toll on the U.S. military, and on this country’s ability to defend itself at a very volatile time in the world. Already, three members of the CIA Paramilitary teams that first entered Afghanistan after 9/11 have been suspended for not getting vaccinated. They're being told to await disciplinary proceedings. Meanwhile, an Army officer — Lt. Col. Paul Douglas Hague -- just announced he's resigning from the military rather than take medicine he doesn’t want or need. In a statement, Hague said he was quote, "incapable of subjecting myself to the unlawful, unethical, immoral and tyrannical order to sit still and allow a serum to be injected into my flesh against my will and better judgment."There are many like him in the U.S. military. The Navy just informed the most famous unit in the entire U.S. military — the Navy SEALs — that members will be forced to leave if they don’t take the shot. It doesn't matter if they have natural immunity, and many do. It does not matter if they have a valid religious or medical exemption. If they don't submit, they can't deploy, and they'll have to leave the SEALs. The deadline is almost immediately.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPTo be clear, in case you’re wondering if this is in response to some kind of crisis: We don’t believe a single Navy SEAL has died of COVID. These are some of the healthiest people in the world, the Olympic athletes of the military. Many of them have had the virus and recovered, meaning they have more natural immunity than the vaccine could ever provide. And yet, as of tonight, we're hearing that hundreds of Navy SEALs face being fired imminently for refusing to take the shot. Keep in mind there are only about 2,500 active-duty Navy SEALs, each of whom costs at least a half-million dollars to the U.S. government to train. Imagine the effect on our country’s military readiness. It’s horrifying. If you love the country, you would not do this. You would also not disable our hospitals by forcing our nurses to resign because they don’t want to take the shot.You’ll notice, by the way, in the case of the Navy SEALs and more broadly the U.S. military that none of the members of Congress who claim to care about our military, they talk about it all the time — defense hawks like Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, and so many others — have said a word about any of this. They have not risen to defend these guys. Because they don’t care.This article is adapted from Tucker Carlson's opening commentary on the September 20, 2021 edition of "Tucker Carlson Tonight."Get the recap of top opinion commentary and original content throughout the week.SubscribedYou've successfully subscribed to this newsletter!This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2022 FOX News Network, LLC.

Whether in the society pages of the 20th century or the TMZ of the 21st we watch bemused as the right sort of people stumble through their rehabs and divorces and petty scandals. But what we cannot abide is a legal or social system that gives the elites a different set of rights, a different set of freedoms.Take New York City’s mandate that all patrons of an entertainment venue must show a vaccine card. It comes with a curious exemption, as all of these capricious rules seem to. The celebrity entertainers and their entourages need not show proof of the jab.

It showed how a small ethnic group – the Scots of Scotland – became the carriers of the seeds of modernization.The book revealed how the key thinkers of Scotland’s 18th century, including Adam Smith, laid down the basic assumptions about capitalism, self-government  and the power of individual enterprise that spread around the world, including to America, with transformative results – one of which was the U.S. Constitution.CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTERPublished in the shadow of 9/11, my publisher and I thought the book would be all but forgotten in the tumultuous and chaotic weeks afterward.  America had real enemies, and real issues to face. Who was going to care about what Adam Smith said or did 200 years ago, or how Scots like James Wilson and David Hume influenced the U.S. Constitution?It turned out, lots of people did. The book became a New York Times  bestseller, and a bestseller in the U.K. and Canada.The Scottish experience in shaping the modern world and America suddenly had tremendous resonance with post-9/11 readers. Right or left, liberal or conservative, they recognized in the themes of the book a message about the importance of civilized values and freedom, and the self-confidence we were going to need in the face of barbarism and terror.My new book, "The Viking Heart: How Scandinavians Conquered the World," is about much more than the fearsome Norsemen who ranged around the world 1,200 years ago and laid the foundations for globalization– or their Scandinavian descendants who settled in America and became part of the American Dream.It’s also about the links between freedom and community, and how a polarized nation can become one again.The answer lies in the cultural skill set the Vikings forged in a harsh and unforgiving homeland and passed on to their descendants – and then to the immigrants coming to America.(Mariner Books)The first component of that set was a robust commitment to family and community. The Danes have a word for it:Samfundssindor social mindedness (samfund meaning ‘society’ and sind ‘mind’). For the Vikings at peace or war, there was no survival without communal survival.The Vikings’ willingness to venture into the unknown for the sake of community and family has universal value.That necessary cooperation built a framework of solidarity and trust that permeated all aspects of life, whether it was digging out a new field for planting from bog and forest or fishing off a rocky windswept coast, doing battle with rivals and strangers or sailing across the Atlantic to the shores of North America – or centuries later making a new life on the American frontier.The second component is a belief in the value of individual hard work, what the Norwegian American sociologist Thorstein Veblen called the instinct of workmanship,  a "disposition to do the next thing and do it as well as may be."You can see this work ethic in the building a long ship or the writing a symphony like the Danish composer Neils Gade or creating a disease-free strain of wheat as Norwegian American biologist Norman Borlaug did – or in the creation of a quantum computer. It’s an instinct that doesn’t just look for ways to benefit ourselves, but also the community – maybe as much, if not more than ourselves.Side by side with that belief in hard work, however, was the willingness to allow individuals to take extreme risks, for the same reason: for the benefit of the whole. That was as much the case with Viking adventurers crossing the Atlantic, or later polar explorers like Roland Amundson or today’s Liv Arnesen, or Norwegian resistance fighters venturing into the frozen North to take out Germany’s nuclear program during World War II.Swedish American Charles Lindbergh took the same extreme risk with his solo flight across the Atlantic in 1927, knowing his achievement wouldn’t just make him famous but change people’s understanding of the importance of air travel – and eventually of air power for America in the Second World War.Today we recognize that the Vikings’ willingness to venture into the unknown for the sake of community and family has universal value. We can see that theirs was a freedom that rested on the foundations of a shared culture built on mutual trust, which their descendants then brought to America and made part of their new homeland.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPIt’s those same values that I believe are now waiting to save us from the storm and even lift the shadows of 9/11, two decades later. They are the antidote to the toxins of critical race theory and wokeness; they are the tonic that will restore America’s faith in itself.These values will make American leadership a beacon of light in the world again, and make American power a force to be respected – a force infused with the spirit of the Viking heart.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM ARTHUR HERMANArthur Herman is a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute.  His new book, "The Viking Heart: How Scandinavians Conquered the World" (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt), was released on August 3.  Follow him on Twitter@ArthurLHerman.Get the recap of top opinion commentary and original content throughout the week.SubscribedYou've successfully subscribed to this newsletter!This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2022 FOX News Network, LLC.

It leaves all of us asking: "What is China hiding?"What we do know about China’s risky virus research program can only be analyzed through the knowledge of the communist regime’s suppression of the truth—leaving many vital questions unanswered. We know theWuhan Institute of Virologywas performing potentially dangerous research on coronaviruses.INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY RELEASES INCONCLUSIVE COVID-19 ORIGIN REPORTThis lab, a biosafety level 4 lab, was approved to conduct potentially dangerous gain-of-function research. The purpose of gain-of-function research is to mutate a virus by giving it new properties—making it more deadly or more transmissible as a result. We also know American taxpayers provided hundreds of thousands of dollars for research at the Wuhan Lab. However, Dr. Anthony Fauci denies these dollars were intended for gain-of-function research.These facts were not our first nor only red flag. As early as 2018, concerned diplomats warned the Department of State of significant safety issues at the Wuhan lab.These diplomats specifically warned of severely lacking safety standards for handling contagious viruses. They even warned that if a virus leaked from the lab, it could result in a new "SARS-like pandemic." These same diplomats confirmed research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology "strongly suggests that SARS-like coronaviruses from bats can be transmitted to humans to cause SARS-like diseases."We also know scientists ended up roaming the Wuhan lab sick with a mysterious illness. The next thing we know was that there were outbreaks of a mysterious new coronavirus in the Wuhan province of China. This seems too unlikely to be a coincidence.WUHAN LAB REPORT RAISES FURTHER QUESTIONS ABOUT POSSIBLE COVID-19 LAB LEAKIf it was a coincidence, why would China expend so much diplomatic capital to block an investigation? If the communist Chinese are innocent, why are they so determined to hide data and silence voices—including those of their own?Information China is hiding is essential to answering the world’s questions. It’s essential to hold China accountable if COVID-19 leaked from the Wuhan Lab, as well as to facilitate critical research into COVID-19’s origins in order to prevent future pandemics and devastating lockdowns.BIDEN SAYS US WEIGHING COVID-19 VACCINE BOOSTERS FIVE MONTHS AFTER SECOND DOSEMillions of people lost their lives around the world, and millions more suffered a year of disruption, fear, and frustration. We owe it to everyone around the world to uncover the pandemic’s origins so future generations do not have to suffer through a similar catastrophe.It even appears as if President Joe Biden agrees. After the release of the Intelligence Community’s report, he remarked, "The world deserves answers, and I will not rest until we get them. Responsible nations do not shirk these kinds of responsibilities to the rest of the world. Pandemics do not respect international borders, and we all must better understand how COVID-19 came to be to prevent further pandemics."CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTERWe wholeheartedly agree. That is why we recently introduced "The World Deserves to Know Act."Our bill would sanction key communist party officials in China who suppressed the truth, including the silencing and jailing of citizen journalists. In the meantime, our bill will prohibit American taxpayer dollars from being sent to China for potentially dangerous research.Finally, our bill gives Taiwan Observer Status in the World Health Organization to be an important check on China’s malign influence over the organization.It is time for President Biden to move past empty threats and commit to decisive action necessary to uncover the pandemic’s origins.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPWe are urging him to lend his support to our bill. Until then, China will continue to keep the world in the dark, even as time to discover the truth begins to run out.Republican Elise Stefanik represents New York's 21st congressional district in the United States House of Representatives where she serves as GOP conference chair.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM REP.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided byRefinitiv Lipper.Fox News medical contributor Dr. Marty Makary breaks down his concerns surrounding the president's vaccine mandates on 'America Reports.'There are debates aroundvaccine mandatesthat focus on individual liberties, federalism, and the political backlash around vaccination. I will leave those topics for others to debate. As a physician, I have medical concerns around the rigidity of the new vaccine mandates. Here is a list.Mandates Ignore Natural ImmunityIf you recovered from aCOVID infection, you havenatural immunitywhich is 27-times more effective than vaccinated immunity in preventing symptomatic COVID, according to a large Israelistudy.Public health officials have beenhesitantto talk about this study for fear that people will choose to get the infection overvaccination.I do not recommend actively or passively getting theinfectionover vaccination because getting the infection can result in a regrettable severe illness (many critically ill patients are asking for the vaccine in the hospital but by then it’s tragically too late).  But for those who were truly sick from COVID, you can feel good about your immune protection.SENIOR WHITE HOUSE ADVISER: BIDEN WILL 'RUN OVER' GOVERNORS STANDING IN WAY OF VACCINE MANDATESFor those who want to further increase that level of protection, I recommend one dose of an mRNA vaccine which can slightly augment one’s immunity, as demonstrated in the same Israelistudy.The new vaccine mandates inexplicably ignore the overwhelming science on natural immunity, resulting in damaged credibility by public health officials and possibly subjecting those already immune to the side effects the second vaccine dose that they may not need.Employers and schools requiring vaccination should recognize natural immunity if they want to be science-based. Unfortunately our public health officials have beendismissiveof natural immunity after digging into their position on this issue early. Recognizing natural immunity would go a long way in restoring the public trust in the public health officials.Mandates make it hard to space out doses to 3 monthsIn general with any vaccine in medicine, the longer the interval between doses, the stronger and more durable the immune protection.  The original 3 and 4 week interval between doses for Pfizer and Moderna was an atypical regimen that was designed to finish the clinical trials quickly last year given the urgent need for a vaccine to come to market.  It was a noble goal, but now it’s time to evolve our recommendation based onthe new science.PENCE TELLS 'FOX & FRIENDS' BIDEN VACCINE MANDATE ‘UNLIKE ANYTHING I EVER HEARD FROM AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT’New studies show that spacing out the 1st and 2nd Pfizer or Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccines by 3 months result in better immunity.In one of those studies, researchers at the University of Birminghamfoundthat delaying the second Pfizer dose to 12 weeks after the first resulted in a 3.5-times greater antibody response in older people.Hematologist Dr. Paul Moss, a co-author of the study, concluded that it’s a good idea to extend the time between the first and second doses of the vaccine. "An extended interval may help to sustain immunity against COVID-19 over the longer term and further improve the clinical efficacy of this powerful vaccine platform," Moss wrote.PENCE URGES YOUNG CONSERVATIVES 'TO GO GET' COVID VACCINE SHOTI personally waited 3 months between my 1st and 2nd mRNA vaccine and recommend the same to others who have only received their 1st mRNA dose so far. Doing so may obviate the need for a booster given thegrowing recognitionby researchers that the first 2 doses 3 or 4 weeks apart may functionally as a single primer dose. But unfortunately the new vaccine mandates will hinder your ability to use this data-driven approach because mandates will have short deadlines for meeting the 2-dose requirement with an mRNA vaccine.Mandates are not flexible with childrenThe current adult dose and short interval between doses may be too high for children. It’s always concerned me that we give are giving the same vaccine dose and short interval between doses to a thin 12-year old girl that we give to an overweight 50-year old man.In addition, If a child had COVID illness and recovered, I do not recommend vaccinating the child because of natural immunity. The exception is children who are immunosuppressed or have a special circumstance.Vaccines do reduce hospitalizations among children by approximately 90 percent.  That’s why Irecommendvaccination of children without natural immunity. But not with the current regimen.CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTERThe complication of heart inflammation after vaccination has been associated with the second dose in particular. These complications have not been adequately studied in my opinion.For adolescents, I recommend they get a single mRNA vaccine dose for now until the heart complications are better understood.  They may be avoidable.One dose was 100 percent effective in an Israeli study of children 12-15 years of age, suggesting a strategy that can protect children from both COVID and the heart complications associated with the second dose.Let’s come togetherVaccinate requirements that are flexible and consider natural immunity are reasonable for essential workers, such as health care workers and teachers. But we should allow people to tailor these recommendations with their physicians.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPPresident Biden has rallied around the term ‘a pandemic of the unvaccinated’ but the more precise term is ‘a pandemic of the non-immune.’It’s those without any immunity who are the ones dying in U.S. hospitals right now and it’s that group where we should all come together to strongly encourage vaccination.Author's note: Comments above represent opinions and do not constitute medical advice.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided byRefinitiv Lipper.Fox News contributor Dr. Marc Siegel has the latest on vaccine effectiveness and masks in schools.PresidentJoe Bidenended his six part COVID battle plan speech Thursday evening in the opposite way from how he began it, talking about unity, about Americans coming together to defeat a common enemy, the coronavirus. Unfortunately, the bulk of his speech took the opposite tone.He began by touting his accomplishments in fighting thecoronavirus pandemicsince taking office. It was an angle that seemed ill-timed given the current delta variant scourge which has filled our hospitals in the South and West and has been infecting our children at an unprecedented rate.And, though thepresidentacknowledged this, he was arguably divisive rather than inclusive by continuing his finger pointing, while issuing new vaccine mandates, aimed at the 80 million eligible Americans who are still unvaccinated.One vaccine mandate extends to businesses of more than 100 employees, another to all federal workers, a third to all hospital workers.BIDEN DECLARES SWEEPING NEW VACCINE MANDATE: 'THIS IS NOT ABOUT FREEDOM'As a physician, I can certainly relate most to the latter and firmly believe all reluctant health care workers must be vaccinated immediately to protect our patients.But when the president reached out to all primary care physicians and urged us to talk to our patients one-on-one and to convince them to get immediately vaccinated, he completely lost me.  I thought, who is he actually speaking to here? Of course, I and every other physician I know, have already been doing just this for many months.REPUBLICANS EXPLODE WITH FURY OVER BIDEN VACCINE MANDATE: 'ABSOLUTELY UNCONSTITUTIONAL'All we ask is to have the vaccine in hand to administer it ourselves, and that obstacle still hasn’t been overcome. President Biden certainly doesn’t need to remind us, among the strongest supporters of the vaccine that there is, to have that conversation with our patients.Better, I think, was the way Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy put it during his interview with Bret Baier on "Special Report" on Thursday night, just an hour later when, speaking as a practicing internist, he said what I have said, too, that you need to meet people where they are by discussing their concerns about the vaccine.President Biden did his best to repair the wound he created by recently stepping ahead of the FDA (leading to two resignations) by calling for vaccine boosters for all by later this month.On Thursday night he clarified that the FDA and the CDC would be looking at the emerging science to decide who should qualify for boosters and who shouldn’t. That’s as it should be.BIDEN DECLARES WAR ON DESANTIS AND ABBOTT: 'GET THEM OUT OF THE WAY'The president neglected to mention, as I pointed out in anop-edfor the Wall Street Journal earlier this week, that the need for Pfizer/BioNTech boosters may be greater and sooner than for Moderna.I agree with President Biden when he said that all airplane travelers should wear masks right now, and that the TSA should enforce it.I am glad for the federal surge response team to help with coronavirus hotspots.When it comes to schools, I also agree with full vaccination for teachers and staff while encouraging more vaccination in the vulnerable 12- to 17- year-old group.A recent study in theNew England Journal of Medicinefrom Israel and Harvard demonstrates that the risk of COVID complications in our teens is far greater than the risk of the vaccine.I also support the notion that the best way to protect those who are still too young to get vaccinated is to vaccinate everyone around them.The best part of the president’s speech on Thursday applied to testing, the fourth part of his plan, though he didn’t go nearly far enough with this. He said he is going to extend the Defense Production Act and work with Walmart, Amazon, and Kroger, to provide rapid test kits at cost, spending $2 billion to provide free testing at 10,000 pharmacies, and 300 million tests for community health centers, food banks, and schools.CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTERThis is clearly a step in the right direction, as Dr. Michael Mina at Harvard, who has been at the forefront of testing advocacy, acknowledged in a tweet after the speech, though he went on to write,"Testing for SARS-CoV-2 during this pandemic is for *Public Health* A test before work is not for the tester but for the strangers on the bus to work **No American should have to pay to keep their neighbors safe** This is Public Health, Not Medicine."I agree with Dr. Mina. Testing needs to be free. The best way to prevent outbreaks at schools is for every child to test at home before they go to school.We are at a very difficult time for COVID as the pandemic has now stretched on far longer than anyone has imagined.Here’s what I would like to tell the president at this juncture: If we have learned anything, President Biden, it is that shaming doesn’t work, solutions need to be flexible and organic, not superimposed as judgmental dictums.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPIt certainly makes sense in our battle against delta for everyone eligible to be vaccinated, for testing to be widespread and free, for proper masks to be worn in close quarters, and for no one to condescend to the so-called 80 million. -- Some of them have already have had COVID and are not yet ready to take a shot to cement their immunity. Others are from minority groups who don’t trust either the medical establishment or the government.They are not all Republicans, or anti-vaxxers or basing their decisions simply on politics.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM DR.

Check out what's clicking on FoxBusiness.com.As Americans gather on Monday to relax and enjoyLabor Daywith their family and friends, it is a good time to reflect on what this traditional holiday means to working Americans in the 21st century.The legislation which made Labor Day anational holidaywas signed into law by President Grover Cleveland in 1894. It was created during a time of rapid industrialization and economic growth, as much of the United States shifted from an agricultural to industrial economy. This period of change created many challenges for working Americans as they had to learn new skills and work long hours.The past year-and-a-half has also presented many challenges and changes for working Americans. The threat of aglobal pandemicreshaped work in ways we could not have imagined even a few years ago.According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, roughly 25 percent of employed Americans worked from home in 2019, and 50 percent had hybrid schedules. In 2020, the Bureau found thenumber of Americans working from home nearly doubledto 42 percent.Even now, with 53 percent of Americans fullyvaccinated, roughly 60 million Americans are working from home full- or part-time. Offices are downsizing their workspaces and adopting hybrid work models. And some are shifting away from physical offices altogether in favor of holding in-person meetings at coffee shops, restaurants, and other public spaces when necessary. At the height of the pandemic, 76 percent of American CEOs said they were considering shrinking their office spaces, according to a September 2020 survey by Fortune and Deloitte.CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTERAs a result, families all over the country are uncertain about what their daily routines and employment will be even a year from now. At the same time, they are striving to balance work and private life when their offices are down the hall rather than down the street.However, Americans have adapted. Citing a recent Goldman Sachs Inc. study, Bloomberg reported: "Since the crisis began, annualized growth in output per hour has risen 3.1%, compared with 1.4% in the previous business cycle, Goldman economists wrote in a note. ‘Stronger productivity growth has been one of the silver linings of the pandemic,’ they said."Through telework and video conferencing, Americans have demonstrated that we can get the job done, despite tremendous obstacles.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPSo, this Labor Day we encourage you to pause and reflect on the successes of the past year, the challenges that remain, and the many opportunities ahead.We wish you a happy Labor Day!CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM AMB.

TheCDCis now about fighting injustice, not disease.The agency says instead of gender-specific pronouns like him or her, use "they," even when referring to one person. And talk about "parents" or "expectant parents" instead of mothers or fathers.After making the hundreds of language changes the CDC recommends, who has time to defeatCOVID-19?CDC'S 'INCLUSIVE' LANGUAGE GUIDE DISCOURAGES SAYING 'ALCOHOLIC,' 'SMOKER,' 'UNINSURED,' 'ELDERLY'The CDC's got mission confusion. With parts of the U.S. considering more COVID lockdowns, Americans don't need language lessons on political correctness. They need scientific information on how to reduce the risk of being infected by this virus indoors. That's key to reopening workplaces and returning to normal.Numerous new technologies are said to destroy airborne viruses, including ionization, dry hydrogen peroxide, far UV light and others. But school administrators and office building managers don't have a clue which ones actually work. They're flying blind.The CDC's thousands of scientists could provide guidance. Not that they should endorse specific brands, but they can assess competing technologies. The CDC flatly refuses. Instead, it cautions against using them because they lack "an established body of peer-reviewed evidence."What planet is the CDC on? Peer-reviewed evidence can take years. Here's the process: An academic journal sends a submitted article to scientists around the world for review and suggested changes. Once that input is received and the article is approved, the wait goes on because many of these journals only publish four times a year.TEXAS SCHOOL SYSTEM CLOSES AFTER 2 TEACHERS DIE OF COVID-19Glacial slowness doesn't work in a pandemic. That's why former President Donald Trump designed Operation Warp Speed for vaccines. The CDC's timetable isn't warp speed. It's warped. The CDC's tacit premise that yesterday's technology is good enough will doom us to failure.Former Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb told the Washington Post last week that the CDC has the wrong mentality to respond to a crisis. "Their mind set is we should polish it, vet it, peer-review it."The result is the CDC offering 50-year-old information: Open windows, space desks apart and use HEPA filters where possible. HEPA filters were devised for gas masks during World War II, and commercialized for buildings in the 1950s.Tried and true methods are not necessarily wrong. But the public deserves the latest science, too.Eighteen months into the pandemic, giant employers like Apple and Amazon again are delaying reopening workplaces. They need help. Only 33% of U.S. office workers are back, according to Kastle Systems. New York City is far worse off, with only 22% back. That kills retail stores, coffee shops and restaurants that serve workers.CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTERIf it were possible to get back to normal without technological breakthroughs, it would have happened already. Eric Adams, the city's likely next mayor, needs scientific information on how to reduce aerosolized COVID-19 virus in transportation hubs, public buildings, offices and schools.Citing the importance of speed in a pandemic, Gottlieb has been urging the FDA to establish a fast-track way of determining what works and what doesn't. The CDC should be doing the same using its own scientists.As for schools, the medical journal Lancet's COVID task force has chastised the CDC for focusing on masking and social distancing instead of air quality.A CDC study of 169 Georgia K-5 schools found COVID cases were reduced more by improving air quality than any other intervention. Mandating masks for students produced no statistically significant improvement.A Kaiser Health News headline in June read: "More than 100 Missouri Schools Have Bought 'Often Unproven' Air Cleaning Technology." The words "often unproven" come from CDC guidance. If school districts are rushing in desperation to buy equipment without enough information, blame the CDC, not the school administrators.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPA spokesperson for the company that sold ionization equipment to Missouri schools explained that peer-reviewed research on its equipment doesn't exist yet. That is why CDC scientists should get to work assessing new technologies themselves instead of writing speech manuals.If the CDC wants to be politically correct, it can call its new air quality guidance "Indoor Environmentalism."

Thanks to the vaccines, we’re beginning to get out into this new world to discover what comes next. And it’s a little scary.As a matter of fact, doctors have found that one-third of teens ages 13 to 18 have ananxiety disorder. Doctors also found that a lot of these teens started feeling anxiety at a younger age, usually around 11 years old and some as young as seven years old.In our attempt to re-enter a more normal existence we shouldn’t forget that we’re not the only ones who are feeling intimidated and nervous; our children are experiencing anxiety too, and we need to provide them with reliable, accessible guidance forstressful days.Worry is something we and our children can overcome. TheBibleoffers us this guidance and we can help our pre-teens process their worries by pointing them to God’s faithfulness.CDC NOT CHANGING SCHOOL GUIDANCE AMID DELTA SPREAD, WALENSKY SAYSThe apostle Paul knew this. In his letter to the Philippians, Paul wanted his friends to know they didn’t have to worry about their lives because God was taking care of them. Here’s what he says in Philippians 4:4-9:Be full of joy in the Lord always. I will say again, be full of joy.Let everyone see that you are gentle and kind. The Lord is coming soon. Do not worry about anything, but pray and ask God for everything you need, always giving thanks.And God’s peace, which is so great we cannot understand it, will keep your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus.Brothers and sisters, think about the things that are good and worthy of praise. Think about the things that are true and honorable and right and pure and beautiful and respected. Do what you learned and received from me, what I told you, and what you saw me do.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided byRefinitiv Lipper.'Tucker Carlson Tonight' host weighs in on the push for mask regulations in some U.S. cities despite vaccination statusKate Brown first became governor ofOregonway back in 2015. At the time, there was not a whole lot going on in Oregon, so voters didn't ask many questions. The one thing they did learn about Kate Brown over and over again is that she is a self-described bisexual. Why is this relevant? Well, themediadidn't explain. They told us, without exactly explaining what it meant, that this fact was historic and it was highly thrilling. Kate Brown’s sex life was shattering ceilings. Woohoo!And yet, if you looked a little closer, you noticed something a little weird, actually, Kate Brown was married to a man. Yes, he had a different last name, but he was still, as they say on TikTok, binary. He was a dude. That's fine, of course. But it was also a little confusing. How does having a groom at her wedding make Kate Brown an official member of the LGBTQ exclamation point community? No one bothered to ask. That kind of curiosity was forbidden. It was like wondering why we don't call Barack Obama half White, which he is. It's not allowed. Stop with the questions. Celebrate.So voters in Oregon dutifully celebrated. And then out from under them, the world changed. Suddenly, things in America went from placid to highly turbulent. That was especially true in Oregon, where there was rioting byleft-wing militiathat went on for more than a year. The state's biggest city was destroyed. People died. And then a virus arrived fromChinaand it killed thousands. It was a very serious moment.HARRIS, NEWSOM REQUIRE RALLY GOERS GET VACCINE OR NEGATIVE TEST DESPITE STAYING IN CARSUnfortunately, Oregon did not have a very serious leader. It had some dopey soccer mom who got elected because she claimed she had a girlfriend in college. Kate Brown, unfortunately, turned out to be lighter than air. She didn't know anything. She had no achievements. Under pressure, she wilted and became irrational. She was exactly the leader you do not want in a crisis. And yet she was the governor, which in the age of coronavirus made her very close to God. And she acted like it. Kate Brown commanded Oregonians to stop going outside without their little masks on, even if they've beenvaccinated.KATE BROWN: Today, I'm announcing that effective Friday, Aug. 27, masks will be required in all public outdoor settings or physical distancing is not possible regardless of vaccination status. … In addition, the Oregon Health Authority strongly recommends masking at outdoor gatherings at private residences where people from different households do not maintain physical distance.At this point, it's almost pointless to apply the traditional measures of logic, reason and data to decrees like that one. She's bisexual. It's cool, the power-mad hypocrites who think these decrees up don’t care what the facts are. But since we are old-school that way, we will try it one last time. Kate Brown's decree is nonsensical.WASHINGTON POST'S PHILIP BUMP DOWNPLAYS NEW YORK'S UPDATED COVID DEATH COUNT FOLLOWING CUOMO'S RESIGNATIONFirst off, if the vaccines work, then why are vaccinated people required to wear masks? And for that matter, why is anyone required to wear a mask outdoors? Outdoor transmission ofCOVIDis so rare that it's practically nonexistent. That is true whether or not you have been vaccinated. As Marc Lipsitch, an epidemiologist at Harvard, pointed out this spring, "Outdoor masking has notable costs and really no evidence of benefits." And that remains true tonight. EvenTony Fauciordinarily only tells the truth in private emails, admitted the same thing in public. "It's pretty common sense now that outdoor risk is really, really quite low," Fauci said.A recent study fromIreland, among others, confirms that this is true. Researchers there considered more than 230,000 COVID cases in Ireland through March of this year. What do they find? They found that only one in a thousand could be traced to outdoor transmission.So as a factual matter, Kate Brown's order is absurd. But even if you ignored the science, even if you convinced yourself that large numbers of people were catching COVID while jogging, you still wouldn't make people wear masks. Because drugstore masks, the kind that everyone wears, do not work. Cloth and surgical masks do not stop COVID. That's not a guess. We know.A new study from engineers at the University of Waterloo, for example, just came out this week, once again, proves that conclusively. The researchers used a mannequin to simulate someone seated in a large room. Some mannequins had common cloth masks. Others had the blue surgical mask that you see everywhere. What did they find? They found that aerosol droplets big enough to contain COVID built up on the mannequins as if the mask wasn't even there. The masks only filtered about 10% of the aerosol droplets, 90% got through.CHICAGO POLICE UNION ‘100% AGAINST’ VACCINE MANDATE FOR OFFICERS: ‘HELL, NO’So on every level, the order you just saw from Kate Brown is ridiculous. And yet, thanks to COVID, as we noted, she is now God, so her orders are now the law and if you ignore them, you will go to jail.REPORTER: Do you want people calling the police on their neighbors?KATE BROWN: Look, this is no different than what happens if there's a party down the street and it's keeping everyone awake. What neighbors do, they call law enforcement because it's too noisy.REPORTER: That could be a yes.KATE BROWN: Yes, yes.So you call the cops. Of course, you call the cops. None of the actual laws are being enforced, but the fake laws, not the ones passed by the legislature, the ones made up by the power-mad governor, will be enforced with guns.WASHINGTON PUBLIC SCHOOL REQUIRES STUDENT-ATHLETES TO WEAR TRACKING MONITORS TO TRACE COVIDThis is happening all over the country. InCaliforniastate, where identity is also more important than competence, one charter school just went into lockdown. Police swarmed the campus. Why? Was there a mass shooting, a terror incident? No. Two siblings came to school without masks, so they called the SWAT team.REPORTER:  It was a tense first day in Springs Charter School in Temecula. Police were called on campus. The entire school went into lockdown and all because two students refused to wear a mask. … Victoria Nelson is a junior at the school and her brother Drew Nelson is a senior. The siblings say they chose not to wear a mask for religious reasons, believing it would be enough to exempt them from the mandate even though no one filed any request with the district or school. … Administrators say Victoria refused to wear a mask or leave class. That’s when we’re told the situation escalated. Listen to what the principal tells her.PRINCIPAL: I need you to stand up or we will have to physically remove you from this classroom.STUDENT: Please don’t touch me.REPORTER: Eventually deputies showed up. The entire school was placed on lockdown and both students were banned from going to that charter school ever again.Oh, they can't go to school ever again, we're going to have the police beat you if you don't leave. That's what the principal just said. There's no evidence that the masks they're being told to wear will protect them, how many healthy school-age kids have died of COVID? Oh, sorry, that's actual science now no longer allowed.What's interesting is that as we call the cops on children and threaten to hurt them if they don't leave immediately and never get educated again, there are an awful lot of people who are actually dying of COVID. Thousands and thousands of elderly people have died of it in this country. No one seems to care about the actual deaths, particularly the deaths caused by the poor decision-making of Democratic governors – particularly in the state ofNew York.Today, we learned thatAndrew Cuomowas lying about how many nursing home patients he killed in New York. It turns out the total number of COVID deaths in the state was about 12,000 more than he said it was – 12,000. Twelve thousand. It's not a small number. Why didn't we know that until today? Think about that. If they can lie about the number of people who died to the tune of 12,000 people – that's a huge problem.You can't make rational decisions about public health unless you have real numbers. How can you determine whether mandatory vaccinations are a good idea, for example, unless you have accurate numbers? But we don't have accurate numbers. Politicians are lying about them and have from day one. But nobody cares.‘INGRAHAM ANGLE’ FINDS SAN FRANCISCO VACCINE MANDATES ARE HURTING BUSINESSESThePentagonpress secretary explained today that all American soldiers, young and healthy, virtually every one of them nevertheless must be vaccinated immediately, whether or not they want or need the shot. Now, this has been done before, the last time the Pentagon forced troops to take a vaccine, that was the anthrax vaccine during the Iraq war, it was a disaster. It led to serious side effects, including death. And the military had to abandon it. But don't worry, says John Kirby. Mandatory vaccines may not be necessary, but they're orders and those orders are lawful.KIRBY: Once you mandate it, as we've done, it's a lawful order, it's a lawful order, and we fully anticipate that our troops are going to follow the orders. When you raise your right hand and you take that oath, that's what you agreed to do.Kind of missing the point, no? Shouldn't they be explaining to us slowly and in ways that we can understand because it is, after all, a democracy, why this is a good idea, showing us the data that justify this decision, explaining what the exemptions might be, telling us how long this is going to go on and what we're going to get out of it in the end? Because all of this is being done on our behalf for our benefit. Right? That's why the U.S. government exists, to help us.TEXAS MAN STRIPS DOWN TO UNDERWEAR OVER MASKS AT HEATED SCHOOL BOARD MEETINGThey don't even mention any of that. His response was, we have the power to do this and we're going to. That's whatJoe Bidenjust said, too. He just announced yesterday that everybody in America should be forced to take the vaccine and then an undetermined number of booster shots from now until forever, regardless of their age or their health status or their religious beliefs or whether critically they have active antibodies or not, whether they've had COVID already and recovered. It doesn't matter, your individual circumstances. One size fits 340 million Americans. That's the plan. So Biden just ordered private business to compel employees to get vaccinated:JOE BIDEN: If you're a business leader, a nonprofit leader, state or local leader who has been waiting for full FDA approval to require vaccinations, I call on you now to do that, require it. Do what I did last month requiring employees to get vaccinated or face strict requirements.So the guy who planned the withdrawal fromAfghanistanis now in charge of our vaccine policy. Some people clearly should get vaccinated. They're at risk. The benefits outweigh the risks of the vaccine for them. Other people probably shouldn't. Not everybody is identical.But it doesn't matter. Because force is their only response. The CEO ofDelta, Ed Bastian, just announced today he's going to be working as Biden's enforcer to make everybody do it. Bastion announced that unvaccinated Delta employees will be fined hundreds of dollars every month. "This surcharge will be necessary to address the financial risk the decision not to vaccinate is creating for our company," Bastian wrote.FULLY VACCINATED SOUTHWEST FLIGHT ATTENDANT DIES FROM COVID-19Oh, but this only applies to COVID. notice there's no other illness, not Type two diabetes, not HIV, not hepatitis, all of those diseases are widespread, all cost a lot of money. But Delta isn't forcing anyone to address those just COVID because the president has commanded it. OK.Is this a good idea? Are the vaccines working in the way they promised they would? Again, it's not an argument against vaccines or even this one. It's an argument in favor of transparency and knowing what the data actually say before you obey.If you're interested, you should take a look at what's happening inIsrael. Researchers there are giving us some answers to those questions. Keep in mind, Israel is one of the most vaccinated countries on the planet. More than 80% of Israeli citizens over the age of 12 are now fully vaccinated against COVID. So this summer, famously, Israel lifted its lockdowns because people weren't getting sick anymore.But now they are getting sick. Israel has one of the highest daily COVID infection rates in the entire world. It's averaging 7,500 confirmed cases a day. That's twice the number from just last week. What is going on here? There were nearly 10,000 cases diagnosed yesterday alone. Hundreds of people have died this month, vaccinated people.So what is that? Again, doesn't mean vaccines are bad, it means we need an explanation for what's going on. Why aren't we demanding one? There are signs that vaccines in this country, too, are not working in the way we were told they were and probably, honestly, in the way that scientists thought they would.According to the CDC, the effectiveness of the vaccines is now dropped to 66% for frontline workers. That's down from 90%. Why is that? Can we get an explanation, please? Tony Fauci won't give an explanation, he's just telling everyone to get the vaccine, and then life will return to normal, maybe if you're lucky, in about a year or so, ish.TONY FAUCI: If we can get through this winter and get really the majority, overwhelming majority of the 90 million people who have not been vaccinated, vaccinated, I hope we could start to get some good control in the spring of 2022.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPSo, 15 days to slow the spread, right? OK, so now it's wear a burka and get a jab every six months in perpetuity.Someone needs to explain what's going on slowly, carefully with data. It's not enough to watch people who believe men can get pregnant tell us they understand the science and we don't and shut up and obey. That's not enough. Not in a democracy which we're hoping this still is.This article is adapted from Tucker Carlson's opening commentary on the August 25, 2021 edition of "Tucker Carlson Tonight."Get the recap of top opinion commentary and original content throughout the week.SubscribedYou've successfully subscribed to this newsletter!This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2022 FOX News Network, LLC.

But one thing abundantly clear to me is that the White House is creating daily COVID headlines to distract from the coverage.On Monday August 16, a video ofAfghanisrunning with a U.S. Air Force plane went viral, triggering sharp bipartisan criticism.Later that day theWhite Houseleak to the New York Times and Washington Post plans to announcevaccine boostersfor every American, despite zero clinical evidence that boosters reduce severe illness.Each news outlet ran the story which got a lot of attention.Public health officialsand their surrogates fell in line and took to the airwaves the next day to explain why boosters will be necessary.VIVEK RAMASWAMY: BIDEN'S AFGHANISTAN CATASTROPHE – HERE ARE THE 3 FLAWED ASSUMPTIONS THAT LED TO DEBACLEColleges like Bryn Mawr in Pennsylvania followed with their own announcement that they mayrequireall students to receive a booster shot.By Wednesday, the wall-to-wall Afghanistan coverage was unrelenting. In response, President Biden gave a speech from the White House to recommend boosters and threatening states over child mask mandates. The president did not mention Afghanistan or take any questions.The U.S. surgeon general followed with a media tour from the White House, explaining on most major networks why all Americans should get a booster, but not anytime soon—after September 20.I’m not alone in asking where is the science to show declining efficacy of the vaccines against severe disease. Many medical experts are aghast as how, out of the blue, vaccine boosters were sternly and universally recommended regardless of age or natural immunity.The White House’s booster recommendation bypassed the usual FDA and CDC ACIP guidance processes. Imagine the outcry if President Trump did such a thing.COVID-19 VACCINE BOOSTERS: HERE'S WHAT TO KNOWBy Thursday, the Biden White House, fending off intense criticism over Afghanistan, hit the nuclear button. They leaked to the media that 9 months after COVID vaccines were granted an emergency use authorization, full approval would suddenly be imminent, re-igniting vaccines mandate debates.That same day, the CDC suddenly issued new guidance for travel that became a news headline on NBC Nightly News and other programs.By Friday more specifics of the FDA’s full approval of the Pfizer vaccines were made public, pointing to Monday as the day it would happen. This kind of forecasting by the FDA is highly unconventional.This FDA, under the leadership of Dr. Janet Woodcock and Peter Marks, has been the most political FDA in U.S. history.  Over 363 million vaccines doses have been administered with an impeccable safety profile, yet the FDA failed to issue full-approval of the vaccines for nearly nine months, fueling vaccine hesitancy.CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTERThe procrastination in issuing full-approval, along with the mismanaged and prolonged J&J pause, has been a catastrophic for public confidence in the vaccine. For months, unvaccinated Americans desperately needed to hear that the COVID vaccines have the full faith and seal of nation’s drug safety regulatory agency.Monday’s full approval should have happened before the delta wave.  Leaking that FDA approval would be imminent 3 days after the viral video of the Afghan airport is curious.Manufacturing news to distract political opponents through the media is nothing new. Both political parties have done it. But medical recommendations should be exempt from these partisan games of public manipulation.  Medical professionals have a tremendous heritage of taking care of anyone in need regardless of politics—a heritage I’m proud of.In my opinion, right now we should not be arguing over recommending universal boosters in late September or masking healthy 2-year-olds, we should all come together to be singularly focused on the task of encouraging non-immune adults to get vaccinated.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThe use of medical recommendations as a smoke bomb from other political problems is an unprecedented violation of the public trust in the medical profession.Please stop playing politics with COVID.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM DR.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided byRefinitiv Lipper.'Tucker Carlson Tonight host and decorated combat veteran Sean Parnell say opposing the import of Afghan refugees is not about race its about our duty to help AmericansIt was just the other day -- two weeks ago exactly -- that theBiden administrationannounced the suspension of private property rights in America. Building owners are prohibited from forcing their tenants to pay rent. Other people now have the right to live in your house for free. America’s housing stock has been nationalized. From here on out, it’s controlled by the Biden administration. But wait a second, you ask. This is America, can that be legal? No, it’s not legal. It’s unconstitutional. TheSupreme Courtsaid so clearly. But as Maxine Waters put it, who cares? What are those old judges going to do about it? What army do they control? They’re not doing anything. So the Biden administration ignored our highest court and just did it. Thanks toCOVID, the media has decided, they can do that. They can do anything. So they are.Where does the leave the rest of us? In a word, exposed. Without property rights, protected by a functioning judicial system, American citizens have nothing at all. Everything you thought you owned, very much including your body, now belongs to theDemocratic Party. Where you travel, who you speak to, where you live, what you say and write and think — all this is now controlled by the Party. And everything means everything, even your medical autonomy.  And this is funny, because for decades they’ve told us that medical decisions can only be made between you and your personal physician. That is a sacred pact. Politicians have no right to tell doctors what to do. Hey politicians, get your hands off my body. That would be The Handmaid’s Tale. Remember? Turns out they didn’t mean it.BLOOMBERG COLUMNIST CALLED OUT FOR SPREADING FAKE NEWS ON FLORIDA ANTIBODY TREATMENTAnd just to show you how much they didn’t mean it, we take you now to New York City, whose mayor is not only famously incompetent but physically unclean. Of the 340 million Americans now living in this country, Bill de Blasio is the single last person you’d go to for medical advice. His diet consists almost exclusively of bong hits and Pringles. There’s no chance he brushes his teeth every day. Your 17-year-old stoner nephew has much better personal hygiene. And yet, somehow, because Bill de Blasio still has political power due to the fact that a tiny group of people once voted for him, Bill de Blasio has decided to overrule practicing physicians and force his subjects to take medicine they may or may not need, and in some cases that might hurt them, whether they want to or not. That’s the rule.InNew York City, you’re no longer allowed to walk indoors, even on private property, unless you've taken a COVID shot and carry the documents to prove that you have. That's now the law — a law that by the way, not a single person voted for — voting being part of that outmoded, racist system we used to call "democracy." No more. According to New York's new order, indoor spaces are off-limits to the unvaccinated. How are we defining indoor spaces? "Indoor spaces are those that have a roof or overhang and three or more walls. In order to enter venues covered by the rule, you will have to show ID along with proof of vaccination."That’s the law. At a press conference yesterday, Bill de Blasio displayed this graphic showing all the places you're not allowed to go without identification and proof of vaccination. Your papers, please. That includes restaurants, bars, cafeterias, grocery stores, bakeries, fast food places, and aquariums. Hope you’re not hungry or looking to see fish. You can’t go.THOUSANDS OF FAKE COVID-19 VACCINE CARDS, SOME FROM CHINA, SEIZED BY US CUSTOMSBusinesses in New York are forced to hang posters explaining the mandate near their entrances. They don't own their walls, either. Bill De Blasio explained all this:DE BLASIO: And it's easy. All you have to do is show proof of vaccination. That could be a CDC paper card, that could be an Excelsior Pass, an NYC COVID Safe app. Whatever works, all you got to do is show that proof and have ID as well.Oh, it’s totally easy. Just show your medical papers. And this applies only to COVID, by the way. No one is checking your hepatitis or HIV status. That would be terrible. But COVID, yes. It’s absolutely required or you’re not allowed to eat. And all you need is proof of vaccination and identification. But wait a minute. Weren’t we told it’s racist to require ID for voting, but now it’s not racist to require ID for people to go inside of buildings in our largest city? So what does this mean for the 72% of young African Americans who are not vaccinated? They’re not going to be able to go anywhere. So this policy, by the principles of equity, has a disparate impact. That’s the phrase they use to describe racism in action. It affects some groups more profoundly than others. And the group most affected by this is young African Americans.NEW ZEALAND TO ENTER NATIONWIDE LOCKDOWN AFTER SINGLE CORONAVIRUS CASE FOUNDSo how can it stand? Where’s the civil rights division of theJustice Department? Aren’t they jumping on this? It’s worse than a standardized test.Bill de Blasio didn't explain any of that. People with power don't need to explain themselves anymore. If you don't comply, you're going to jail. Not for looting. That’s fine in New York now. It’s reparations. But failing to follow a law no one voted for and show your papers in a restaurant, that’s something Bill de Blasio will not accept.DE BLASIO: And we're going to remind people that we really want people to take this seriously. Don't fool around with fake vaccination cards. By the way, it's against the law and there are serious penalties for that.Serious penalties! What are you going to do to us? The same thing you did to the people who looted Macy’s? Buzz off, Dumbo.So what exactly does this law say? We checked the fine print because we believe in the law, and this rule does not allow for exemptions, period. Not for religious reasons, because religion is stupid, worshiping Bill de Blasio is our new state religion. And not for medical reasons, because Bill de Blasio is now your doctor and he’ll decide what is necessary.So we asked City Hall in New York to see if we were missing something. They couldn’t answer the question, but told us that people who had concerns can contact the city’s Small Business Hotline for more information, so, like morons, we did that. We followed instructions. The operator on the hotline told us they’ve been inundated with hundreds of calls from people asking the same question, but they didn't have the answer. Sorry. It’s a mystery.SURGE IN NEW COVID-19 CASES AMID DELTA SPREAD ‘GOING VERY STEEPLY UPWARD’Finally, this afternoon, purely because we’re a news organization and they suspected we might report some of this, City Hall got back to us and finally sent us some guidance. They said that businesses can't allow unvaccinated customers indoors for "anything beyond a quick and limited purpose."So there are no exceptions to this rule. And that would include people who have already had COVID, and therefore have high levels of protective antibodies in your system. That doesn’t matter. They have to get the shot anyway. Bill De Blasio demands it.Is that safe? I’ve had COVID. I’ve recovered. I have high levels of antibodies. Not going to get COVID, unlike a lot of people who have just been vaccinated, probably not going to get it. But you can get the vaccine anyway. Is that a good idea? Not a ton of research on this, that’s frowned on now. But researchers at Mount Sinai Hospital have looked into it. They found it may not be safe. It turns out that serious whole-body reactions -- including chills, fever, and joint problems – are far more common in people who’d recovered from COVID and got the vaccine anyway. No one is surprised by this. This is why we don’t vaccinate people against diseases they’ve already recovered from. Except now. They must get the vaccine, even though it doesn’t seem to offer much protection from COVID infection weirdly. Ask Texas governor Greg Abbott. He’s vaccinated. He’s also sick with COVID right now. How’d that happen? What’s going on here exactly? What’s this about? We’d love to know.Unfortunately, we’re long past the time when the people in power felt they had to answer even simple questions. The emphasis is on us and our total obedience. The disgraced governor ofNew York, the second to last person you’d call for medical advice, told more than 600,000 healthcare workers in his state that regardless of what they think about medicine, they must get the shot.CUOMO: I think we need dramatic action to get control of this situation. So in New York and our state hospitals, all patient-facing healthcare workers must get vaccinated. There will be no testing option for patient-facing healthcare workers. That is a point of contact that could be a serious spreading event and we want to make sure that those healthcare workers are vaccinated - period.Nobody has a sense of humor anymore. Getting a COVID lecture from Andrew Cuomo? The person single-handedly responsible for the highest death rate from COVID in America. Let’s go ahead and put Idi Amin as the head of the human rights commission next time, shall we? And then not allow anyone to laugh about it.CHICAGO PHARMACIST ARRESTED FOR ALLEGEDLY SELLING 125 COVID-19 VACCINE CARDS ON EBAYSo, here you have Andrew Cuomo, who may or may not be a made member of the mafia, telling you that he suddenly knows more about COVID than practicing nurses and physicians. He’s telling them what to do. He’s giving them a medical mandate. What's interesting is he feels he has to.What’s interesting is how many of New York's health care workers remain unvaccinated. They don’t have the information necessary to make that decision. They don’t know enough about COVID? They treat COVID.And yet, as of today, more than 75% of New York's 450,000 hospital workers, as well as 74% of the adult care facility workers and 67% of the 150,000 nursing home workers have taken the COVID shot. The rest have not.Why is that? Maybe before we mandate anything we should answer that question. Why would people in the medical profession be willing to risk losing their jobs over the shot? That’s a sincere question, what’s the answer. Hey Business Insider, hey Atlantic Magazine, hey New York Times, why don’t you do a story on that? And just answer the simple question. And then answer this: why are bureaucrats with no medical expertise whatsoever – Bill De Blasio, the pothead, who doesn’t wash his socks, Andrew Cuomo - telling nurses and doctors what drugs they must take? This is totally nuts.REPORTER: Houston Methodist hospital requiring all staff members to get vaccinated for COVID-19 or be firedNURSE JENNIFER BRIDGES: Right off the bat, I pretty much decided I was not going to do it.  Everybody in America should have the right to decide what they put in their body.REPORTER: Jennifer Bridges has worked at Houston Methodist- in Baytown- more than 6 years.NURSE JENNIFER BRIDGES: I planned on staying with Methodist the rest of my life.REPORTER: She spent the last year and a half treating coronavirus patients- and even got sick herself.NURSE JENNIFER BRIDGES: I just had an antibody test a week ago, but it doesn't count for them.  It doesn't work.REPORTER: more than a hundred co-workers have joined Jennifer with this lawsuit against the hospital. It claims methodist is forcing its employees to be human guinea pigs.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPIt's hard to argue with their reasoning, and if you want to argue with it, what’s the argument against it. Speak slowly so we can understand. But no one wants to argue anything anymore. It’s purely about obedience. It’s hardly about medicine. More than 150 healthcare workers in the Houston hospital system were fired. Remember that next time they tell you there’s a healthcare shortage in this country.This is lunacy. We should not go along with it. It has nothing to do with medicine. It’s a terrifying precedent that if we let solidify, we will deeply regret. This is not about COVID, it is about the existence of rational decision-making in this country and personal autonomy.This article is adapted from Tucker Carlson's opening commentary on the August 17, 2021 edition of "Tucker Carlson Tonight."Get the recap of top opinion commentary and original content throughout the week.SubscribedYou've successfully subscribed to this newsletter!This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2022 FOX News Network, LLC.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided byRefinitiv Lipper.Fox News contributor Dr. Marc Siegel has the latest on vaccine effectiveness and masks in schools.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has expanded its emergency use of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna’sCOVID-19vaccines to authorize a booster shot for certain immunocompromised patients including those with HIV, cancer, organ transplants, and those taking immunosuppressant drug.This group amounts to close to 3 percent of the U.S. population and is a step in the right direction based on a growing body of evidence that at least some of the immune protection garnered from thesevaccinesbegin to wane after six months.The FDA authorized aCOVID-19 booster shotfor certain immunocompromised patients after evidence indicated a weak immune response following the initial two-dose series.This move is a big step in the right direction especially given the increasing number ofvaccine breakthrough infections from the delta variant, unfortunately it doesn’t go far enough.CDC PANEL VOTES TO RECOMMEND COVID-19 BOOSTER SHOT FOR CERTAIN IMMUNOCOMPROMISED PATIENTSAs a practicing internist I will likely have discretion in interpreting the new FDA rules to apply to my patients, but as with Israel, I would like to have the option to be able to provide boosters for all my patients over 50, as well as those who are obese, have diabetes, heart and lung disease, and are semi-immunocompromised from chronic illness.Israel on Friday lowered to 50 from 60 the minimum age of eligibility for a COVID-19 vaccine booster shot and will also offer them to health workers, hoping to stem a surge in Delta variant infections.And what about health care workers? Those of us on the front lines, seeing patients every day, are at higher risk of COVID breakthrough infections as well as unwittingly spreading COVID in part because we were among the first who were vaccinated last winter, and therefore among the first whose vaccines are likely becoming less effective. Israel is now offering boosters to health care workers as well.FDA GREENLIGHTS COVID-19 BOOSTER VACCINE FOR SOME IMMUNOCOMPROMISED PATIENTSI think we should follow Israel’s example and offer boosters to these groups as soon as possible. We should target all with chronic illness, health care and front line workers including teachers, police, firefighters.There is no science yet to confirm that if you wait too long to boost a fading immunity from the COVID vaccine you will have to start all over with a vaccine series, but this is true with many of our regular vaccines including hepatitis, shingles, and HPV.So now is the time.And what about the Johnson and Johnson shot? Studies of a two shot regimen (similar to the Oxford/Astra Zeneca vaccine) are ongoing, but not yet complete.DELTA VARIANT: HOW DO I GET TESTED FOR IT?Here again, I believe that an additional shot will prove quite useful in cementing a durable immunity against a wildly changing terrain, with more easily transmissible variants emerging (delta, etc.) which are at least somewhat resistant to the vaccine.Across the country, many patients who feel they are at risk are probably going to pharmacies and receiving a third shot by simply not acknowledging that they had a previous one.There is no uniformity from state to state in terms of these records. I certainly do not recommend this, and no doctor should.CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTERWhat I can do, as I wait for all the data to roll in and for an MRNA booster to become widely accessible, is to check what is known as a spike antibody protein on all my patients who have received the vaccine.This test is quite variable from lab to lab and it is NOT a direct indicator of immunity, since it includes many antibodies that are not neutralizing the virus, but recent studies on neutralizing antibody itself against the SARS COV 2 virus have shown that it is a good indicator of overall immunity against this virus.So I and many others use the spike antibody test as an informal guide – if your value is low it is an indicator that your immunity may not be sufficient, if it is high, it is reassuring.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPOf course even if your number is low, I still don’t have a formal way to remedy that with a quick booster.I join other doctors and patients across the country hoping this reality changes soon.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM DR.

It’s one of the reasons I trust him so much.The relationships we have with ourdoctorsare often the most trusted relationships of our lives. Our doctors tell us hard truths that others will not. We often tell our doctors what we will not tell others. We trust our doctors to give us the good, the bad and the ugly about ourhealthso that each of us can make an informed decision.Yet, we don’t always take our doctor’s advice.DR. MARC SIEGEL: COVID, SCHOOLS AND OUR KIDS – FORGET MASK MANIA, TEACHERS NEED TO BE VACCINATED FIRSTWe know excessive drinking or eating or a lack of exercise can all cause us harm. Heck, watch the advertisement for any drug your doctor has prescribed and you know that even your doctor’s best advice can come with substantial risk.Ultimately these decisions rest with us as individuals, not our doctors, and certainly not the government.Enter COVID-19, an economic shutdown, government mask mandates and now private business mandates that threaten people’s livelihoods.As a congresswoman, I have never publicly advocated for or against taking the vaccine. I’ve never revealed my private health information, although I’ve made it clear that in the past my husband and I have made the choice to be vaccinated and to vaccinate our children. Why take that public position?I’ve never told others what to do with the vaccine because I am not a medical doctor and I do not believe it is the proper role of a politician or a bureaucrat to mandate what should be a personal, informed medical decision.It is not the government’s right to tell you what to inject into your body.In Congress, I am focused on securing your constitutional rights and personal freedoms.When I say to beware of the "Fauci Ouchi," it is a way to cut through the clutter and communicate that the heavy hand of government should never threaten you with taking an injection you may be skeptical of or are unwilling to take. The government certainly should not be knocking on your door or offering lottery proceeds to get you take a vaccine.One of President Trump’s great accomplishments was Operation Warp Speed, which ushered in COVID-19 vaccines in record time. Millions have taken the vaccine, millions have chosen not to. My hope is that the millions who have taken the vaccine made the right decision for themselves.We will be judged and be forced to live with the long-term implications of how many personal freedoms we were willing to give up in the name of personal safety.For those that want the vaccine and believe it works, take it and don’t be so concerned about those who made the decision not to. For those choosing not to, make sure it is an informed decision with your doctor.For those deemed most at-risk, please seek medical advice from a doctor on how best to protect yourself. That does not mean forcing the rest of us from living our lives, shutting down our businesses, closing our schools or forcing us to wear masks and stripping away our right to health care privacy.So far, my family and I have personally experienced all of that and think it is anti-American bullcrap.They started by giving us good advice to wash our hands, avoid touching our faces and keep distanced from those that were sick for a couple of weeks.CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTERSince then, it’s been a nightmare driven primarily by Democrat politicians, including Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who mandated thousands of hospitalized elderly New Yorkers be sent to nursing homes, where many ended up unnecessarily spreading the disease and dying, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who forced mask mandates while taking hers off. Now big tech and big business are getting in the mandate business, too: Get injected, or lose your job.We will look back and recognize the mandates forced upon us had far more to do with hypocritical, power-grabbing politicians than sound medical advice.We will be judged and be forced to live with the long-term implications of how many personal freedoms we were willing to give up in the name of personal safety.I am proud to stand on the side of personal freedom. I promised when I ran for public office that my four boys would never grow up in a socialist country and as long as I have something to say about it, they won’t.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThe government isn’t your doctor and neither is the news media or your employer. Life comes with plenty of risks.

Apparently, immigrants just get put on airplanes, buses, and trains, and go off into America.We are learning that a substantial number of the people who have crossed the border illegally haveCOVID-19. McAllen, Texas had to declare a state of emergency when7,000 infected immigrants arrived there. So, the Biden government could send people with COVID-19 to your neighborhood and then refuses to tell you that it has put you at risk.Some of theillegal immigrantshave gang connections including members of the famous MS-13 El Salvadorian gang. Keep in mind,a 2020 Department of Justice report found that 74 percent of the MS-13 defendants in custody were here illegally. Under the wide-open Biden policy, they can be sent into your town without you knowing it.HOUSE REPUBLICANS DEMAND ANSWERS FROM DHS ON 'APPALLING' BORDER NUMBERS AS CRISIS ESCALATESWhat makes the Biden policy so infuriating is its sheer scale.In the first seven months of the Biden presidency more than 1 million people have been stopped crossing our southern border, and a substantial number of additional people have entered illegally without being noticed officially by the federal government.The flood of people crossing illegally is growing. The recorded number (not counting those who came in avoiding all contact with the government) entering the United States has grown from 78,442 in January as Biden was being sworn in to 210,000 in July alone.What makes this growth so sobering is that historically illegal immigration drops in the summer when crossing the desert is so hot it is deadly. President Biden’s smile is apparently overcoming the Mexican heat.If the number of migrants keep growing, there will be more than 2 million entering the United States this year (not counting the additional ones who will enter without the government knowing it).DEROY MURDOCK: COVID IS AN INVISIBLE ENEMY AT WAR WITH US, AND BIDEN IS GIVING IT AID AND COMFORTAt a time of pandemic, rising violent crime rates, and confusion in and around our schools, it is legitimate to ask what is happening to thousands and thousands of people flooding in illegally. Americans know this is dangerous. In one poll,90 percent indicated they want every illegal immigrant tested for COVID-19.The Biden administration has refused to tell governors, mayors, county commissioners, school systems, or local police how many people who crossed illegally they are sending to their communities or what the immigrants’ circumstances are. How many have COVID-19, how many are gang members, or how many have violent criminal records?The threat of COVID-19 infection is not merely rhetoric. In McAllen, Texas the federal government has buses running every 30 minutes bringing people who crossed illegally from the border and dumping them at the bus station, so they can move on to anywhere in America with no supervision.TEXAS BORDER CITY SAYS MORE THAN 7,000 COVID POSITIVE MIGRANTS RELEASEDAccording to the Valley Central Hidalgo County Judge Richard Cortez:"Now we’re seeing that they’re coming in with a high infection for COVID, and there’s no room for them anymore."Cortez also told ValleyCentral the infection rate for migrants rose to a shocking 16 percent.It is clear the Biden administration COVID-19 strategy is tight control of Americans and no control for people coming to the country illegally.Since everything is secret, we really don’t know who is paying for housing, food, medical care, or schooling. In fact, as the number of people in the Biden flood passes 2 million this year, the amount being spent is going to rise dramatically.COVID CASES IN RIO GRANDE VALLEY SECTOR SURGE BY 900%The numbers are so large that it helps to visualize the Biden policy as a matter of importing entire cities.Rachel Peterson of Gingrich 360 translated the growing influx of people in the county illegally into city sizes. Imagine if the Biden administration had a plan to import a city a month of people in the country illegally.Here are their first seven cities:In January, 78,442 people came into the country illegally. This is the same size as New Rochelle, New YorkFor February, 101,095 people crossed, the same as the population of San Angelo, Texas.In March, 173,265 people crossed illegally, the population of Salem, Oregon.In April, 178,850 people illegally entered the country, or the population of Newport News, Virginia.In May, 180,641 people came in, equaling the population of Chattanooga, Tennessee.In June, 188,829 people entered, or the same as the population of Knoxville, Tennessee.In July, 210,000 people came in illegally, the same number of people living in Birmingham, Alabama.CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTERWith Biden’s policy of importing as many people into the country illegally as possible continuing, there will be five more city equivalents coming this year – and 12 more city equivalents in 2022.Where are all these people going?How many of them have COVID-19?How many of them are criminals?The Biden approach of controlling Americans with masks, vaccinations, COVID-19 passports, and lockdowns, while allowing more than 1 million people this year enter America illegally – and then wander the land anonymously – is an unsustainable policy.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPEvery senator, congressman, governor, state legislator and city, county and school board official should be demanding detailed information about any person who entered the country illegally being sent into their communities.Until we find out where the Biden flood is going, we are all at risk.To read, hear, and watch more of Newt’s commentary, visitGingrich360.com.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM NEWT GINGRICHGet the recap of top opinion commentary and original content throughout the week.SubscribedYou've successfully subscribed to this newsletter!This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2022 FOX News Network, LLC.

His come-and-get-it, no-borders policy offers a laurel and hearty welcome to COVID-infected illegal aliens.Biden’s red carpet forCOVID carrierson the US-Mexico boundary— atop his mandatory vaccines for U.S. military personnel and vaccination papers for lawful foreign visitors — epitomizes hypocrisy, reckless endangerment, and quite likely negligent homicide.McAllen,TexasRepublican Mayor Javier Villalobos issued a Declaration of Local Disaster on August 2.According to a municipal-government statement published on Wednesday: "Since mid-February of 2021, there have been over 7,000 confirmed COVID-19 positive immigrants released into the city of McAllen byCBP[Customs and Border Protection], including over 1,500 new cases in the past seven days."TEXAS BORDER CITY SAYS MORE THAN 7,000 COVID POSITIVE MIGRANTS RELEASEDAlso, 135 illegals in CBP’s Rio Grande Valley sector tested positive for COVID-19 in July’s first half,up 900 percentversus the previous 14 months.Patrons at a Whataburger restaurant in La Joya, Texas, fretted on July 26 when several other diners coughed, sneezed, and failed to wear masks. A concerned citizen waved down law enforcement after observing this. According to police who responded, these migrants said they were caught by the Border Patrol, released, and then tested positive for COVID."No one told the police department that these people were here," La Joya Police Sergeant Manuel Casas complained. These and other illegal immigrants were guests of Catholic Charities of The Rio Grande Valley and were housed at La Joya’s Texas Inn & Suites.Sergeant Casas told Fox News: "The information we have is thateveryone that is staying in that hotel is COVID-19 positivebecause it’s being rented out for them.""Not everyone we encounter we test, only those exhibiting some type of symptoms, and not everybody has symptoms that has it," Border Patrol union leader Chris Cabrera said July 31 on "Cavuto Live," "We are releasing people out the door — day in, day out — with actualpositive tests for COVID, and more just keep popping up."COVID CASES IN RIO GRANDE VALLEY SECTOR SURGE BY 900%Catholic Charities and other private outfits largely conduct COVID tests on illegal immigrants, such as they occur.Statistics on this crisis are chilling. They confirm that COVID is more common and less inoculated against in countries whose people are busiest busting through the border.•In America, as of Friday’s seven-day running average, there were 30new C-19 infections reported daily per 100,000 people. Among thetop-five nationswhose citizens the Border Patrol has encountered since October:-Mexico — 85-Honduras — 102-Guatemala — 107-El Salvador — 26-Ecuador — 40•Reuters reportsthat 50.3 percent of Americans are fully vaccinated against COVID. Elsewhere? Not so good:-Mexico — 26.7 percent-Honduras — 9.8 percent-Guatemala — 6.9 percent-El Salvador — 34.7 percent-Ecuador — 33.8 percent•COVID tests are running 7.1 percent positive in America.-Mexico — 35.5 percent-Guatemala — 19.6 percentWhat about the other eight of 10 top nationalities encountered at the US-Mexico border?Our World in Data, associated with Oxford University, has no such current information. Some countries lack the expertise and/or resources for such reliable tracking.Citing a document briefed to Biden on Thursday, NBC Newsreported Saturday: "More than 18 percent of migrant families and 20 percent of unaccompaniedminorswho recentlycrossed the U.S. bordertested positive forCOVIDon leaving Border Patrol custody over the past two to three weeks."Even worse, Axios reports,30 percent of ICE detainees refuse to be vaccinatedagainst COVID-19.What chutzpah! Nearly one third of these people, most of whom ran across the border, spurn the shot that American authorities expect them to take — to protect U.S. citizens, and as part of being processed. How dare they? Who do these people think they are?Furthermore, social distancing is a distant memory for today’s invading army of illegal aliens. They are being stacked in stash houses, packed in tractor trailers, and backed into federal facilities, sometimes at 600 percent of capacity.'INCOHERENCE' OF BIDEN BORDER CRISIS STRATEGY MAY LEAD TO DEMOCRAT ELECTION LOSSES: WASHINGTON POST EDITORIALIt appears that COVID-positive illegal immigrants are rarely quarantined. Instead, they enjoy taxpayer-funded bus and airplane rides to cities across America. They reach their destinations after Team Biden neither asks permission of nor even alerts relevant state and local officials.These jurisdictions then must cope with COVID-19-positive foreign citizens who have broken into America and instantly become health burdens on communities already reeling under this pandemic, the delta variant, and a range of other socio-economic-medical nightmares that hardly need illegal aliens to exacerbate their cost and complexity."I am alarmed and extremely concerned by recent reports of illegal immigrants being released from local detention facilities in West Texas and transported to the Abilene community in my District. It is my understanding that illegal immigrants are arriving at bus stations, the Abilene Airport, and other places within our community where they arefree to travel anywherein the United States," Rep. Jodey Arrington, R-Texas wrote DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas on August 5. (Mayorkas has repeatedly insisted, "The border is closed.")"The lack of communication and transparency surrounding this process is entirely unacceptable," Arrington continued. "Your agency failed to notify myself or any other local officials of these activities, leaving us unable to answer the concerns of our constituents in the communities we represent."BORDER CRISIS SHOWS NO SIGN OF SLOWING AS MIGRANTS POUR IN; FORMER OFFICIALS SLAM ‘NATIONAL EMBARASSMENT’Among the questions Arrington could not address and for which "I expect immediate answers"…*"Is every illegal immigrant tested for COVID-19 before being released into the Big Country?*"With the Delta variant spreading rapidly throughout Texas and the nation, what is the protocol for an illegal immigrant who tests positive for COVID-19?"In yet another destructive turn, Biden’s Justice Departmentsuccessfully suedto stop a measure by Texas Republican Gov. Gregg Abbott, that would have let police officers halt cars that they reasonably suspected were carrying COVID19-positive illegal immigrants. Federal judge Kathleen Cardone agreed with DOJ.So, for now, COVID-19-positive illegal immigrants may drive around wherever they want and share the virus as they go.CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTERStopping the spread of COVID-19 takes a far-back seat to Biden’s No. 1 priority: Inviting as many Future Democrats of America to breach the border and, later or sooner, vote for Left-wing candidates and causes.Biden and his ilk crave one thing above all else: Total Democrat control.If COVID-infected illegal aliens sicken or even kill American citizens, they couldn’t care less, as long as the Donkey Party eventually winds up in the Winner’s Circle.Florida Republican Gov.

Similarly, all truck drivers will also be required to be fully vaccinated to enter the U.S. one week later on Jan. 22.Republicans on the Hill remain concerned that President Biden’s vaccine mandates could have negative impacts on the trucking industry and the supply chain crisis.Sen.

Steve Daines said he thinks "these overreaching vaccine mandates will shutter Montana businesses and force Montanans out of work.""It’s going to hurt our Montana trucking businesses and make this inflation and supply chain crisis even worse," he added.While several of the trucking officials said they were seeing the vast majority of their drivers getting shots in their arms, they remain concerned the existing driver shortage could spell trouble if even a small portion of drivers fall from the line."We pull probably 12 to 14 loads a day in and out of Canada. The concern that drivers have to be vaccinated to come back into the United States – get into Canada and come back here – is a big concern as far as our employment goes," Steve Hanson, general manager of Hanson Trucking said. "As with any small business in Montana, two to three people can break a business quick."Hanson said he was lucky to be able to report that 99% of his drivers had gotten the shots in their arms.Another trucking company that ships produce out of California up to Canada said all of its drivers had gotten vaccinated as well."They weren’t real happy about it, but they said they still have to feed their families," the official said."Some drivers have done it under protest," Hanson said during the roundtable, adding that "the biggest driver behind that protest is because it’s a mandate."Daines said his frustration is rooted in the fact that migrants entering the country are not subject to the same vaccine requirements.SUPREME COURT TO HEAR ORAL ARGUMENTS ON CHALLENGES TO BIDEN VACCINE MANDATESTrucks line up near Pier J to retrieve shipping containers from a China-based ship at the Port of Long Beach in California on April 4, 2018.(REUTERS/Bob Riha Jr.)"It has made no sense to me," the Montana senator said. "Why the president kept the northern border locked down and the southern border wide open? Canadians have a vaccination rate of about 80%. On the southern border, like when the Haitians were flooding across, it was less than one percent."Other industry officials present at the roundtable expressed frustration with what they argued were arbitrary guidelines, asking why the line was drawn at businesses with 100 employees or more.Republicans have pushed back on the vaccine mandates issued under the Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), arguing mass layoffs or resignations could further hinder supply chain issues and inflation.But Labor Secretary Marty Walshsaid last monththat the majority of truckers will not actually be affected by the sweeping mandate because, for the most part, they work solo in the cab of their truck.TheOSHA guidelineshave an exemption for workers "who do not report to a workplace where other individuals such as co-workers or customers are present."Chris Spear, president and CEO of the American Trucking Associations,championedthis carveout last month and called it "an enormous victory for our association and industry."People arrive at City Hall in protest of COVID-19 vaccine mandate in New York City Oct. 25, 2021.(REUTERS/Eduardo Munoz)Spear said the exemption would give the trucking industry "the relief it needs to keep critical goods moving, including food, fuel, medicine and the vaccine itself."While Spear championed the carveout, he has helped lead a suit currently in the Supreme Court challenging the sweeping vaccine mandates.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPBut Daines argued the exemption only shows that the regulation is illogical to begin with."Creating carveouts for some companies and not others shows how arbitrary and senseless this mandate really is," he told Fox News.

Psaki said Biden meant nobody could have predicted the nature of the variants."Nobody knew that there would be the number of different variants.

REUTERS/Evelyn Hockstein(REUTERS/Evelyn Hockstein)Arguments over the mandate for healthcare workers at facilities receiving Medicaid and Medicare funding remains more murky, with a federal appeals court lifting the ban on that mandate last week. The ruling created an avenue for enforcement of the mandate across the country, though it remains to be seen how the Supreme Court will ultimately rule.Biden's employer mandate was dealt its largest blow by U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana Judge Terry Doughty, who ruled the administrationdoes not have the authorityto bypass Congress on the issue and halted enforcement nationwide."If the executive branch is allowed to usurp the power of the legislative branch to make laws, two of the three powers conferred by our Constitution would be in the same hands," he wrote. "If human nature and history teach anything, it is that civil liberties face grave risks when governments proclaim indefinite states of emergency."CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPU.S. Supreme Court(AP)But the administration has defended the rules, arguing that such mandates have been successful at the federal level."We know vaccination requirements work," a White House official said after the ruling. "The federal government, the country's largest employer, has successfully implemented its requirement in a way that has boosted vaccinations and avoids any disruptions to operations."Michael Lee is a writer at Fox News.

Dan Crenshaw, R-Texas, reveals why the Biden administration should apologize to the Trump administration on 'Fox News Primetime.'The White House on Wednesday said President Biden's "acknowledgment" of former President Trump and his administration for their success in makingCOVID-19vaccines available to the public was a "reflection" of Biden's "belief" that "the enemy of the American people is the virus."Biden, on Tuesday afternoon announced increased testing capacity and expanded access to vaccines and support for hospitals across the country amid a surge in cases of the omicron variant, which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced this week makes up more than 73% of new infections in the country.EXCLUSIVE: TRUMP 'VERY APPRECIATIVE' AND 'SURPRISED' BIDEN ACKNOWLEDGED HIS ADMINISTRATION'S COVID VACCINE SUCCESS"Just the other day former President Trump announced he had gotten his booster shot. That may be one of the few things he and I agree on," Biden said Tuesday. "Let me be clear, thanks to the prior administration and our scientific community, America is one of the first countries to get the vaccine."President Biden speaks during a meeting with his task force on supply chain issues, Wednesday, Dec. 22, 2021, on the White House campus.(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)In an exclusive interview with Fox News Tuesday evening, Trump reacted to Biden acknowledging his administration’s efforts."I'm very appreciative of that – I was surprised to hear it," Trump told Fox News. "I think it was a terrific thing, and I think it makes a lot of people happy."Trump said he thought Biden "did something very good.""You know, it has to be a process of healing in this country, and that will help a lot," Trump said.During the White House press briefing Wednesday, press secretary Jen Psaki was asked why Biden invoked his predecessor, and whether mentioning Trump was an attempt to reach a different audience."Well, I think it was an acknowledgment that the former president sent an important signal to many Americans about the importance of getting boosted, and if they were opposed to getting boosted or opposed to getting vaccinated," Psaki said."I think it's a reflection of the president's belief that the enemy of the American people is the virus, and this shouldn't be a political battle," Psaki added.Psaki, though, in an apparent swipe at Trump said Biden’s praise "doesn't mean we are not going to call out misinformation or steps or actions that are being taken by any leader that we feel are detrimental to the health and well-being of communities around the country.""But we can also call out actions that we think are positive and send a good message to people who may not be waiting for President Biden to tell them what to do," she said.The Trump administration created Operation Warp Speed, a public-private partnership to create vaccines against the novel coronavirus, as the pandemic raged in 2020. Under his administration, the Food and Drug Administration approved emergency use authorizations (EUAs) for the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines.Trump in December 2020 signed an executive order that would ensure all Americans had access to coronavirus vaccines before the U.S. government could begin aiding nations around the world.BIDEN ANNOUNCES SUPPORT FOR HOSPITALS, ACCESS TO FREE COVID TESTS, VACCINE AVAILABILITY AMID OMICRON SURGE"This is a great thing that we all did," Trump told Fox News, referring to the rollout of the COVID-19 vaccines.

"We should be really happy about it because we’ve all saved millions and millions of lives all over the world."Trump, who is fully vaccinated, told Fox News that he received a booster dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. The former president was hospitalized with COVID-19 in October 2020.For those still hesitant to receive a COVID vaccine, Trump said: "You have to embrace it. You don’t have to do it, and there can’t be mandates and all those things, but you have to embrace it."TRUMP SAYS DEMS 'DISPARAGED' COVID-19 VACCINE WHILE HE WAS PRESIDENT: 'NOW THEY WONDER WHY' SOME ARE HESITANTTrump said getting Americans vaccinated is "really a matter of tone" instead of mandates."It’s a matter of getting people out to, ideally, get the vaccine," Trump said. "If you have the mandate, the mandate will destroy people’s lives – it destroys people’s lives, just as the vaccine saves people."He added: "I think that it’s really a question of tone.

The county is also telling people to avoid singing indoors, "wear a mask when gathering indoors" and to set tables grouping only people from the same household.Louisiana's government issued similar guidance, telling people to "mask indoors when not with your everyday household." Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser recommended the same, telling people to "wear masks indoors, even at small gatherings."D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser in October 2021.

MAKARY: PEOPLE IN ‘DENIAL’ THAT CORONAVIRUS HAS BECOME A SEASONAL ILLNESSThe strict advice comes nearly two years into the pandemic and one year after state and local governments went as far as to ban gatherings over a certain number, or of different households. This is despite the proliferation of vaccines and vaccine requirements and the continued wearing of masks by many Americans.And the advice from cities and states is often conflicting.Chicago says that "[f]ully vaccinated people can gather indoors with others who have been fully vaccinated without restrictions" while the unvaccinated "should consider not attending gatherings over the holidays."But Philadelphia Health Commissioner Cheryl Bettigole said nobody should be gathering for Christmas, regardless of vaccination status."Please do not hold or attend holiday parties indoors, it's just too dangerous," she said.Officials are now telling people not just to wear masks in public, but even in their own homes when with family members from different households. Some are even asking people to cancel their Christmas gatherings altogether.(iStock)ZELDIN, REPUBLICAN RUNNING FOR NY GOVERNOR, SLAMS HOCHUL, DEMS OVER MANDATES: ‘CAN’T AFFORD TO SURVIVE HERE'Nearby Delaware County, Pennsylvania, was just as stern."Limit in-person holiday gatherings to only people you live with or limit to a small group of individuals with whom you are regularly in contact," its newest guidance says.California, meanwhile, says everyone should "[k]eep gatherings small," but "[i]f everyone at an indoor gathering is vaccinated, masks are optional." Among unvaccinated guests, the state recommends gatherings that are only "short, and outdoors" with mask-wearing.The spike in U.S. coronavirus cases comes as the omicron variant is now the dominant variant in the country. Millions of Americans are attempting to get COVID-19 tests ahead of the holidays, but there is a major shortage thatPresident Bidensaid he aims to address by creating a process by which the government will send Americans at- home tests if they request one. But that effort almost certainly won't make a difference in the shortage before Christmas.The White House is warning that unvaccinated Americans are "looking at a winter of severe illness and death." And some cities are urging vaccinated people to shun gathering with the unvaccinated altogether.NBC NEWS ANCHOR SUGGESTS PEOPLE SHOULD ‘SELF-LOCKDOWN,’ CHANGE LIFESTYLE IN LIEU OF FEWER COVID RESTRICTIONS"With the holiday season quickly approaching, many people are planning to gather with loved ones to celebrate. The Milwaukee Health Department urges those who are gathering to do so safely. This means gathering with only fully vaccinated friends and family," the Milwaukee Health Department says in its guidance.President Biden announced this week that the government will provide at home COVID-19 tests to anyone who asks – but the tests will not be available for Christmas.(BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP via Getty Images)Illinois recommends social-distancing and small groups for holiday gatherings and that people "[c]onsider wearing a well-fitted mask when indoors, even if fully vaccinated."Santa Cruz County in California is reminding people to "[r]emember to always wear a mask whenever indoors with persons from outside your household and ask guests to do the same." In fact, the county reinstated a mandate for mask-wearing in private homes with members of other householdslast month.Wisconsin doesn't require masking in private homes. But it is recommending it for Christmas when around family members who live in different households."Wear a well-fitting mask in indoor spaces when others are present who do not live with you," Wisconsin's Christmas coronavirus guidelines say.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThese guidelines for distancing, masking and avoiding traditional holiday gatherings for the second straight year follow news that Americans' mental health is significantly deteriorating – a phenomenon many attribute to the virus mitigation measures.U.S.Surgeon GeneralDr. Vivek Murthy earlier this month issued a warning of a growing youth mental health crisis. And new government data, analyzed by the group Families Against Fentanyl, shows overdoses of the drug are now the leading cause of death among people between 18 and 45 – above COVID-19, car accidents and any other cause of death.There are also emerging therapeutics for COVID-19, though there is not yet a major effort by the federal government to make them broadly available, even as vaccine breakthrough cases become more common.Fox News' Audrey Conklin contributed to this report.Tyler Olson covers politics for Fox News Digital.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.FIRST ON FOX:Nearly two dozen top Republicans in the lower chamber on Wednesday called on Speaker of the HouseNancy Pelosi, D-Calif., to reopen the Capitol for publicvisitor access.In a letter obtained by Fox News, ranking member of the Committee on Oversight and Reform, Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., accused the speaker of using the coronavirus pandemic as a pretext to "assert control over every aspect of American life."Ranking member James Comer speaks during a House Oversight and Reform Committee hearing.(Jonathan Ernst-Pool/Getty Images)PELOSI EYES VOTE EARLY NEXT YEAR AFTER MANCHIN'S MAJOR BLOW TO BUILD BACK BETTER"Your closure has continued despite safe and effective vaccines, treatments, and testing being widely available to most of the population for almost a year," the letter signed by 23 Republican ranking members said."Why are you unnecessarily keeping the People’s House closed?" they questioned.The Capitol was originally shut down to public access at the onslaught of the pandemic in March 2020.The closure coincided with nationwide shutdowns, including access to the White House, all Smithsonian museums and even national parks.But the lawmakers pointed out that since the first lockdown nearly two years ago, nearly 81% of Americans ages 12 and up have received at least one dose of the coronavirus vaccine – a sentiment echoed by President Biden in his address to the nation Tuesday.CONGRESSIONAL DEMS ROILED BY DIVISION ON ISSUES FROM MASSIVE SPENDING BILLS TO VACCINE MANDATESHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi talks to reporters during her weekly news conference in the U.S. Capitol Visitors Center.(Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)Biden vowed the nation would not see more shutdowns as concerns have increased regarding the effectiveness of the vaccine in fending off the omicron variant."Because omicron spreads so easily, we’ll see some fully vaccinated people get COVID, potentially in large numbers," the president said. "But these cases are highly unlikely to lead to serious illness.""Vaccinated people who get COVID may get ill, but they’re protected from severe illness and death," Biden added in his plea with unvaccinated Americans to get shots in their arms.But in answer to a question about whether the U.S. would see more shutdowns, he said, "Absolutely no.""More than 200 million Americans have been fully vaccinated," the president explained. "In March of 2020, no one was fully vaccinated."President Joe Biden speaks about the omicron variant of the coronavirus from the State Dining Room of the White House.(Drew Angerer/Getty Images)Lawmakers urged Pelosi to allow the Capitol to reopen to the public in coordination with national parks and Smithsonian museums – particularly during the holiday season.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP"Speaker Pelosi’s refusal to reopen the U.S. Capitol complex goes against science and restricts Americans from visiting the People’s House and petitioning their elected officials," Comer said in a statement to Fox News. "It’s past time for Speaker Pelosi to let go of the bah-humbug attitude and reopen the Capitol to the American people."But Pelosi's office said reopening the Capitol to public access is not a matter the speaker has control over."Such decisions are made by the House and Senate sergeants at arms in consultation with the Office of Attending Physician," a spokesperson for Pelosi told Fox News on Wednesday.Fox News could not immediately reach the congressional sergeant at arms for comment.Get all the stories you need-to-know from the most powerful name in news delivered first thing every morning to your inboxSubscribedYou've successfully subscribed to this newsletter!This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2022 FOX News Network, LLC.

Kathy Hochul is facing pushback against her mask mandate fromRepublicanandDemocraticcounty executives who say they will not enforce the order on Long Island, north of the Big Apple and elsewhere in the Empire State.Speaking at a press conference in western New York Monday, Hochul argued that enforcing the mask mandate "is the easiest thing you can do" to combat the spread of the new variants of COVID-19. The Democrat affirmed that "this is not that big of a deal" to businesses she’s spoken to in that region, despite at least a dozen county executives elsewhere in the state criticizing the mandate.NYC POLICE UNION OUTRAGED AFTER MURDERER OF FIRST FEMALE COP KILLED IN LINE OF DUTY PAROLEDNew York State Governor Kathy Hochul addresses the media during the 2021 New York City Veterans Day Parade on Nov. 11, 2021 in New York City.(John Lamparski/Getty Images)More than a dozen counties said they will not enforce the mandate, theDemocrat & Chroniclereported. The measure requires everyone at indoor establishments that are not private homes to wear a mask regardless of whether or not they are vaccinated. Enforcement falls on county health departments, which would issue $1,000 fines.But local leaders refusing to enforce the mandate say their health departments are stretched thin and tensions are high among residents familiar with prolonged statewide COVID-19 restrictions last year, after New York City became the center of the pandemic in March 2020.Dutchess County Executive Marc Molinaro, a Republican representing the Poughkeepsie area, rejected Hochul’s mask mandate, tweeting: "We will not escalate tension or conflict or further burden our local small (businesses) by allocating resources we do not have to this impractical & unenforceable measure."Molinaro, whose father died from COVID-19, has accused county Democrats of spreading the false rumor that he tested positive for COVID-19 after being spotted out and about maskless.Democratic Suffolk County Executive Steve Bellone also indicated last week that the eastern end of Long Island would not do "hard enforcement" of the mask mandate.In Nassau County, closest to neighboring Queens, incoming Republican executive Bruce Blakeman said he would not enforce the mask mandate once he takes office Jan. 1."Come January 1st, my administration will move Nassau forward with a common sense approach that acknowledges the facts, science and progress made by our residents while also protecting businesses and jobs from any further damage created by government mandates," Blakeman said in a statement."Nassau County is not in crisis, and should not be painted with the same broad brush as the rest of the state. Ninety-seven percent of adults in Nassau County have received at least their first dose of the vaccine and Nassau hospitals have adequate capacity to handle existing demand."Until then, current Nassau County Executive Laura Curran, a Democrat, told theNew York Postlast week she would not be actively enforcing the mask mandate but would be responding to complaints and assisting businesses with compliance however possible.Of the five suburban counties north of Manhattan, only Westchester has voiced strong support for the mandate. Westchester County Executive George Latimer, a Democrat who recently tested positive for COVID-19 despite being fully vaccinated, said he would enforce Hochul’s mandate "to the best of our ability and with great discretion and understanding," theYonkers Timesreported.The governor said most counties are complying with the mask mandate and the state would be sending inspectors to do spot checks and provide other resources for enforcement.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP"Masks are so simple," Hochul said Monday. "Because we’re doing the right thing, we don’t have to talk about shutdowns."Addressing media at a press conference in Albany on Monday, Republican U.S. Rep.

Therefore, ‘to permit an agency to expand its power in the face of a congressional limitation on its jurisdiction would be to grant the agency power to override Congress.’"The ruling states that Biden’s HHS justified the vaccine mandate using sections of the Social Security act that don’t pertain to vaccines."Sections 1102 and 1871 of the SSA give the HHS Secretary authority to make rules to ensure the efficient administration of programs ‘of the functions with which each is charged’ and as ‘may be necessary to carry out the administration of the insurance programs’ 42 U.S.C. § 1302; 42 U.S.C. § 1395hh," the ruling says.

Randy Sutton says he has been impressed with the 'rhetoric' coming out of the White House, but 'hasn't seen much as far as action goes'White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Monday that there are a "range of reasons" for the increase in crime and smash-and-grab robberies in cities across the country, dodging a question on whether "soft on crime" policies are to blame.Smash-and-grab looters have been targeting stores across the nation in recent weeks, robbing retailers of thousands of dollars in merchandise in cities like San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago, Seattle, New York, and Minneapolis.PSAKI SAYS ROOT CAUSE OF ORGANIZED RETAIL CRIME IS THE COVID-19 PANDEMICDuring a White House briefing Monday, Psaki was asked whether she thought cities were experiencing an increase in crime due to its prosecutors and their "soft on crime" approach."I would say, we have seen, I’m not going to attribute the reasoning from here," Psaki said. "What I will tell you is we have seen an increase in crime over the course of the pandemic. There are a range of reasons for that."Psaki, though, said the White House is focused on "what we can do to address it.""The president has proposed additional funding in the budget to make sure local police departments and cops have the funding they need," Psaki said. "We also have worked directly with police departments in areas where they are seeing the highest impact of the crime, the retail theft—which we have great concern about."She added: "That’s what our focus is on currently -- is action and doing what we can to make sure the funding is out there to the communities that need it the most."Psaki was pressed further on specific incidents of criminals released from prison back to the streets without prosecution—such as the man who allegedly burned down the Fox News "All American Christmas" tree in New York City last week—and whether President Biden felt that was "good governing.""I think I’ve spoken to the president’s concerns about retail theft," Psaki said. "If you have specific—and the actions taken for specific cases, I would point to the local police departments or the Department of Justice."Craig Tamanaha, 49, was arrested last Wednesday in connection with the alleged torching of a Christmas tree outside the Fox News and News Corp headquarters in New York City. Tamanaha was freed on no bail last week.Investigators said the 50-foot artificial tree was set ablaze using a burning piece of cardboard, the New York Post reported. The fire’s damage was estimated to cost about $500,000.FOX SQUARE ALL-AMERICAN CHRISTMAS TREE ARSON SUSPECT FREE ON NO BAILThe arson and other charges Tamanaha was facing – including criminal mischief, reckless endangerment and criminal trespass -- were considered misdemeanors, not requiring a bail payment under New York City’s liberal bail laws, Assistant District Attorney Matthew Bayley told the New York Post.This, as the White Houseis standing by its push to end cash bail – saying the decision to hold defendants should be based on the threat they pose to society, not their ability to pay bail."Ending cash bail will not automatically put people charged with crimes on the streets," a White House official told Fox News last month. "It just means that whether you get bail should be based on the threat you pose, and not how much money you have in your bank account.""There shouldn’t be a separate criminal justice system for wealthy Americans," the official added.Meanwhile, as for the spike in crime, Psaki earlier this month said COVID-19 and guns were "root" causes of the increase in organized retail theft.WHITE HOUSE STANDS BY PUSH TO END CASH BAIL IN WAKE OF WAUKESHA PARADE ATTACK"One of the root reasons of crime in communities is guns and gun violence, and we’ve seen that statistically around the country," Psaki said last week, adding that a "root cause in a lot of communities is the pandemic."A White House official told Fox News earlier this month that the administration is monitoring reports of looting and said that officials have seen "some of the disturbing videos documenting these thefts.""This sort of conduct is absolutely unacceptable, and we’re using every resource at our disposal to support local authorities and crack down on organized retail theft," the official said.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThe official added that the Justice Department, the FBI, and federal law enforcement have been in contact with jurisdictions where this has happened to offer assistance in investigations.Meanwhile, the Department of Justice announced recently that San Francisco and Los Angeles – where a number of high-profile retail thefts have happened – will get funding to hire 50 and 20 more police officers, respectively, through the $140 million COPS program the president has championed, the official said.Fox News' Peter Doocy contributed to this report.Brooke Singman is a Fox News Digital politics reporter.

"I don't want to say that nobody [will get the virus if they’re] vaccinated, but it's very rare.

Eighty-four percent of the people in our hospitals are unvaccinated, and they absolutely had every chance to get vaccinated.""And at this point, I think it's almost like they made a deliberate decision not to get vaccinated," he added. "I still encourage everybody who hasn't been vaccinated to get protected. And for those who are, make sure to get that booster after six months.

I've been very open about this law, and I think there are big legal questions, but I also respect the City Council. They made a decision," de Blasio said.This echoed what he told a local radio show in September – months before the council approved the bill – in which he claimed the council likely does not have the legal authority to pass such a measure and that doing so would discourage people from becoming citizens.The bill will allow roughly 800,000 noncitizens to vote in city elections, including green card holders and those with work authorization, provided they have lived in the city for at least 30 consecutive days before an election.As mayor, de Blasio has the power to veto the bill, but he made clear that he is not interested in doing so.NY REPUBLICANS VOW TO TAKE LEGAL ACTION IF DE BLASIO SIGNS BILL ALLOWING NON-CITIZENS TO VOTEThe mayor acknowledged that "this is an important issue," but said his "central issue" is overcoming COVID-19 and the omicron variant."That's where my focus is," de Blasio said.New York's Mayor Bill de Blasio makes declarations at a mass vaccination site at Yankee Stadium amid the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic in the Bronx borough of New York City Feb. 5, 2021.(REUTERS/Carlo Allegri)De Blasio also addressed his controversial vaccine mandate for private sector workers. The mayor defended mandates in general, stating that every mandate he has imposed has resulted in more people being vaccinated, and as a result, "the city is open and thriving."The mayor also claimed that despite increased numbers in several violent crime categories, New York City is "a much safer city than we were eight years ago."According to NYPD statistics, the city has had more murders and rapes to date in 2021 than in 2013, although the total numbers of "index crimes" – murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, grand larceny and grand larceny of an automobile are down. Index crimes in 2021 are up by more than 1,000 compared to 2020, which de Blasio described as a "horrible patch" during the pandemic.The mayor, who will leave office when his term ends at the end of the year, now has his sights on the governor's office. While he has yet to officially announce his candidacy in the Democratic primary race against incumbent Acting Gov. Kathy Hochul and others, de Blasio admitted he's considering it despite low poll numbers.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP"Fox News Sunday" host Chris Wallace pointed to polling data showing that just 6% supported him compared to 36% for Hochul, and that 55% had an unfavorable view of him.De Blasio was unfazed, stating that the low numbers at such an early date "pretty much reminds me of every election I've ever been in," and he is used to being an underdog."It's not where you start, it's where you finish," he said.Get all the stories you need-to-know from the most powerful name in news delivered first thing every morning to your inboxSubscribedYou've successfully subscribed to this newsletter!This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2022 FOX News Network, LLC.

John Hoeven R-N.D., said in a press conference with other Republicans."And I think in the House, there a very good chance that they will get enough people to sign on to this, to actually force a vote," Hoeven added. "Now, we understand that, that when that goes to the administration the president may well veto it. But we've sent a very clear bipartisan message on behalf of the people that this mandate needs to be stopped."Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D., said Wednesday he believes there are enough Democrat House members to force a vote on a Congressional Review Act resolution disapproving of President Biden's vaccine mandate for businesses. (Tyler Olson/Fox News)COVID VACCINE MANDATES: WHERE DO THEY STAND NOW?Republican senators last month coalesced around a plan to use the Congressional Review Act (CRA) to try to invalidate the president's vaccine mandate for businesses that have more than 100 employees,Fox News first reported.Under the CRA, the House and Senate can each pass a resolution disapproving of a federal regulation. If the resolution passes both houses it goes to the president to sign or veto.It's almost certain that Biden will veto the CRA resolution aiming to repeal a regulation he ordered his administration to put in place. But being forced to veto the bill would be an embarrassing political defeat for the president and a major victory for opponents of his vaccine mandate.The Senate Wednesday is set to bring Congress one step closer to doing just that when it votes on its CRA resolution. Not only does the resolution have the support of all 50 Republican senators, but it has the backing of at least two red state Democrats.Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., speaks as, L-R, Sen.

"That’s why I intend to join a bipartisan majority of my colleagues in defending Montana jobs and small businesses against these burdensome regulations.""I do not support any government vaccine mandate on private businesses," Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va. said last week. "I have long said we should incentivize, not penalize, private employers whose responsibility it is to protect their employees from COVID-19."It's not clear if the House of Representatives will be able to vote on the bill. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., attacked Senate Republicans for their efforts to block Biden's vaccine mandates, so it is almost certain she will not willingly bring the bill to the floor.Samantha Ervin, left, a pharmacist at the Upper Tanana Health Center, administers the second COVID-19 vaccine shot to Maggie Roach Thursday, Sept. 23, 2021, in Tok, Alaska.

It's not clear there are that many House Democrats who oppose Biden's vaccine mandates.But if the same level of support for the resolution in the Senate holds up among Democrats in the House, it is possible that the resolution could pass and put Biden in a very difficult spot."Why wouldn't they?" support the resolution, Sen Mike Lee, R-Utah, said.

Here, para professional Jaevon Walton, middle,  reminded a student to wear his face mask in a learning pod of 2nd through 7th graders, Tuesday, Sept. 8, 2020, in Minneapolis.(Photo by David Joles/Star Tribune via Getty Images)"In terms of purely broad effectiveness, the least effective mitigation we’re implementing in this process is masking," Kelley said in a recording of the closed-door meeting on Sept. 3, obtained by the conservative think tank. "Masking, the quality of the consistency of the fit, all those things are highly variable in a population setting.""[Masks are] incredibly effective in a healthcare setting when you’re wearing certain kinds issued gear and things of that nature," Kelley reportedly said. "But at an elementary school level, I know from dropping my kids off, I see kids wearing dirty old masks, cloth masks that look like they don’t fit and they have a half inch gap under their chin to high quality masks to the equivalent to respirators, Kn94s and Kn95s. So there’s a wide gamut."Kelley was took a more confident tone about masks in his remarks to parents."They’re called best practices because this is the evidence-based data we have for driving how to protect kids in school environments based on experiences we saw in the last two school years," Kelley said in the meeting, which waslivestreamed on YouTubeon Aug. 2. "Masking is at the top of that list. The ability to have source control and then some aspect of protection for the wearer is a phenomenal tool to control a respiratory pathogen like COVID.""My kids seem to be surprised when they’re not wearing a mask and we go somewhere," the father of three added. "They seem accustomed to wearing it."Masked students wait to go to their classroom during the first day of class at Stanford Elementary School in Garden Grove, CA on Monday, August 16, 2021. Students and teacher were required to wear masks in the classroom but not outside.((Photo by Paul Bersebach/MediaNews Group/Orange County Register via Getty Images))When asked for clarification, Kelley sent a statement to Fox News saying his agency "continues to advocate for a multi-layered approach to stop the spread of COVID-19, including vaccination, improving ventilation, social distancing, masking, getting tested when appropriate, staying home when you’re sick, and more.""Remarks made in August noted masks were high on the list of these layers of protections, as COVID-19 vaccines for children age 11 and younger were not yet available," he continued. "Masking was something parents could do to minimize risks to their children. Other interventions were, and still are, in the control of the school district to implement."Remarks in September were in response to the question: What are the mitigation levers in addition to masking for schools?" he added. "The response included additional steps to masking that school districts could take, including maximizing airflow and exploring policies for vaccination and screening of symptoms."During acommunity forum for Edina Public SchoolsMonday evening, Kelley said that while vaccination remains the No. 1 tool in combating COVID-19, the "layers of mitigation" like masking are still "critical."He said he doesn’t believe masking should be made optional for students any time soon.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP"When we have case rates in the 100 per 100,000 and our hospitals are overwhelmed, that is not the time to make a change. I like to see stability and soundness and data," Kelley said. "So, wait a couple of weeks. If we’re on a continuous trend for several weeks, things are stable, things aren’t changing, then start having those conversations. But if you take things down, you’ve got to have a process to take it back up.""The data is consistent," he said. "Without [masking] we see a higher case rate, we see more health risks, we see more challenges. There are districts in the metro that don’t have much in the way of requirements or enforcement. Those schools are routinely facing challenges with case rates and challenges with mitigation."Jessica Chasmar is a reporter for Fox News Digital.

Biden regularly asserted that it was formerPresident Trump's"ineptitude" that "caused the country to have to shut down in large part," and assured voters that his administration would take care of the pandemic more efficiently.However, as the latest variant, omicron, begins popping up in the U.S., the president's language is less forceful and his promises are less grandiose."We gotta beat it back before we shut it down.

"Releasing this data should also confirm the FDA’s conclusion that the Pfizer vaccine is safe and effective and, thus, increase confidence in the Pfizer vaccine."FDA PLANS TO AUTHORIZE PFIZER BOOSTERS FOR ALL ADULTS BEFORE WEEK'S END: REPORTSBut Justice Department lawyers representing the FDA argued the plaintiff’s request includes more than 329,000 pages of documents — all of which need to be scrubbed to ensure "trade secret[s]" are not publicly released."The FDA does not have the personnel or resources in its FOIA office to process plaintiff’s FOIA request at a rate of more than 80,000 pages per month," the defense argued.Incourt documentsfiled last month, the DOJ said the branch responsible for reviewing and releasing the pages to the PHMPT has just 10 employees who are currently juggling 400 pending FOIA requests.(iStock)The FDA has proposed that just 500 pages a month be released instead, which means if the federal judge agrees to the agency's terms, the PHMPT can expect to receive the entirety of the information it seeks by 2076.CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP"The FDA’s only priority should be the health and safety of consumers," Norman said Thursday.

"The federal government, the country's largest employer, has successfully implemented its requirement in a way that has boosted vaccinations and avoids any disruptions to operations."The official said the Biden administration's "implementation sends the clear message to businesses, including federal contractors, that similar measures will protect their workforce, protect their customers, and protect our communities."President Biden waves as he walks to board Air Force One, at Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland, Tuesday, Nov. 30, 2021.(AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster)"We are confident in the government’s authority to promote economy and efficiency in federal contracting through its vaccine requirement and the Department of Justice will vigorously defend it in court," the official said.The White House statement comes after a federal judge in Louisiana on Tuesday ruled in favor of a request from Republican state Attorney General Jeff Landry to block the Biden administration’s emergency regulation issued earlier this month requiring vaccines for nearly all health care workers in facilities funding through the Centers for Medicare or Medicaid Services.LOUISIANA FEDERAL JUDGE BLOCKS BIDEN VACCINE MANDATE FOR HEALTH CARE WORKERS NATIONWIDEAttorneys general in 13 other states joined Louisiana in the lawsuit.U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana Judge Terry Doughty ruled that the Biden administration does not have the constitutional authority to go around Congress by issuing such a mandate.Lurie Children's hospital registered nurse Carolyn Ruyle prepares a dose of a Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine at Lurie Children's hospital Friday, Nov. 5, 2021, in Chicago.(AP Photo/Nam Y. Huh)"If the executive branch is allowed to usurp the power of the legislative branch to make laws, two of the three powers conferred by our Constitution would be in the same hands," he wrote. "If human nature and history teach anything, it is that civil liberties face grave risks when governments proclaim indefinite states of emergency.""During a pandemic such as this one, it is even more important to safeguard the separation of powers set forth in our Constitution to avoid erosion of our liberties," he added.Doughty hinted that the case "will ultimately be decided by a higher court than this one," but wrote that, nevertheless, "it is important to preserve the status quo in this case.""The liberty interests of the unvaccinated requires nothing less," Doughty wrote.Meanwhile, the decision in Louisiana comes just a day after U.S. District Judge Matthew Schelp, of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri, issued a separate32-page orderon Monday blocking the Biden administration from enforcing their vaccine mandate on health care workers in 10 states.The 10 states impacted by that ruling are those that sued the Biden administration over the rule: Alaska, Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wyoming.JUDGE BLOCKS BIDEN VACCINE MANDATE FOR HEALTH CARE WORKERS IN 10 STATESSchelp ruled the order exceeded Biden’s authority.And both rulings on Biden’s vaccine mandate for health care workers come after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, earlier this month, upheld a stay on a separate Biden vaccine mandate for private businesses.The Biden administration, earlier this month, unveiled the Labor Department’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration COVID-19 vaccine rule, which required employers with more than 100 employees to ensure that all workers are either fully vaccinated or subject to weekly testing and mask wearing.The mandate also hit businesses that fail to comply with fines reaching as much as $14,000 per violation with the potential for multiple citations.After the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit upheld its stay on the mandate, the OSHA suspended the enforcement of the rule."The court ordered that OSHA 'take no steps to implement or enforce' the [Testing Emergency Temporary Standard (ETS)] ‘until further court order.’"The agency said it "remains confident in its authority to protect workers in emergencies."OSHA SUSPENDS ENFORCEMENT OF COVID-19 VACCINE MANDATE FOR LARGE BUSINESSES"OSHA is complying with the 5th Circuit’s stay," a Department of Labor official said. "OSHA is not enforcing or implementing the reg – so they are not engaging or offering compliance assistance."It is unclear, at this point, if those legal battles will reach the Supreme Court.But on Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court turned away an emergency appeal from employees of Mass General Brigham—the largest hospital system in Massachusetts—who objected to the COVID-19 vaccine on religious grounds.Justice Stephen Breyer did not comment Monday in rejecting the request from employees for a religious exemption to the system’s vaccine requirement. Lawyers for the employees said in court papers that six have been fired, one has resigned and another was vaccinated in order to remain employed.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThe employees who sued contend the requirement violates federal workplace discrimination laws.Meanwhile, the Supreme Court currently is weighing an appeal from health care workers in New York who object on constitutional grounds to a state vaccine mandate that does not offer a religious exemption.Last month, the justices turned away a similar appeal from Maine, over three dissenting votes.Fox News' Jacqui Heinrich, Jon Brown, Michael Lee, Kyle Morris and The Associated Press contributed to this report.Brooke Singman is a Fox News Digital politics reporter.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.Theomicron variant'sseemingly inevitable spread in the United States could prove disastrous forPresident Biden, who has seen his pandemic approval numbers sink to negative territory in the most recent polling."The new omicron variant is a real threat to Biden’s standing with the public," Ipsos president of U.S. public affairs Clifford Young told Fox News on Tuesday. "He won the election on COVID, surfed the COVID wave for the first part of the year and was hurt by the Delta variant. Omicron could further weaken the president heading into the midterms."Young's comments came after the mostrecent Fox News pollingshows Biden underwater by one point when it comes to his handling of the pandemic, with 48% of respondents saying they approve his handling and 49% saying they disapprove.President Biden speaks about the COVID-19 variant named omicron, in the Roosevelt Room of the White House, Monday, Nov. 29, 2021, in Washington. as Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases listens.(AP Photo/Evan Vucci)FOX NEWS POLL: FEWER BELIEVE IN COVID VACCINE, MANDATESAlthough those numbers represent the president's highest approval marks on any issue, they still stand in stark contrast to his rating earlier this year. Six months ago, Biden was in the positive on his handling of the pandemic by 30 points, 64-34%.Young said he doesn't believe that the new variant will present an opportunity to regain his standing in the eyes of the public."America has become more optimistic with anticipation of an end to COVID," he said. "And any check on this trend will negatively impact confidence overall and in Biden more specifically."Young's sentiment was largely echoed by David Barker, director of the Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies at American University."I would say that as long as COVID lingers on and people’s lives are being disrupted by it, that Biden’s approval will continue to take a hit," Barker told Fox News on Tuesday. "And it will get worse over time. So if omicron turns out to transmit more rapidly and severely than Delta did — and especially if it resists the vaccines — Biden’s numbers will sink lower and lower."(Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)While Biden on Mondaycalled the omicron varianta "cause for concern," he cautioned that its emergence was no reason for Americans to panic and signaled he is against a new push for lockdowns."On Thursday, I'll be putting forward a detailed strategy outlining how we're going to fight COVID this winter, not with shutdowns or lockdowns but with more widespread vaccinations, boosters, testing and more," Biden said.SEVERAL CALIFORNIA CHILDREN SICK AFTER CLINIC ADMINISTERS WRONG COVID VACCINE DOSESBarker said not pushing for lockdowns may hurt Biden with some of his supporters initially, but pushing for them would likely do more to harm his standing in the long run."In the short run, his numbers might get even worse if he then does not decide to shut things down again — because he will lose favor with people on his own side who currently support him," Barker said. "In the long run, though, shutting things down will make him even more unpopular, because it would tank the economy again — producing the dreaded two-headed monster of stagflation."Barker also noted that passing massive stimulus legislation likely won't be in the cards for Biden if the situation worsens, pointing to how inflation is already pressuring the economy.(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)"Those gigantic deficit spending bills helped the U.S. weather the economic fallout of COVID shutdowns better than the rest of the world, but are also partially responsible for the inflation pressure we are currently experiencing," Barker said. "We just can't deficit spend to that degree anymore."CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPBarker's sentiment on lockdowns was shared by Young, who didn't think that Biden moving in that direction would help his numbers rebound."Lockdowns are a public health decision," Young said when asked if Biden's decision not to call for them could have been motivated by poll numbers. "But implementing them is more likely to hurt than help Biden numerically."Michael Lee is a writer at Fox News.

"It could be less deadly, it could be more. We don’t know yet."We are not jumping to conclusions because we want to be clear with the American public about what we do and don’t know," she added.White House press secretary Jen Psaki(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)CHINA CONCERNED ABOUT OMICRON EFFECT ON BEIJING WINTER GAMESPsaki’s comments came just hours after Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel predicted that current vaccines – effective at fighting the beta and delta variants of the coronavirus – may not be effective in countering omicron.In an interview with theFinancial Times, Bancel said he did not envision a "world" in which the vaccine held the same effectiveness in fighting the latest variant as it did in combating the delta strain.The Moderna head claimed to have spoken with other scientists who have said it’s "not going to be good.""I think it’s going to be a material drop," he said. "I just don’t know how much because we need to wait for the data."Moderna COVID-19 vaccine(AP Photo/Rick Bowmer, File)Drug makers are still testing the effects of the vaccine on the recent variant and President Biden has said omicron is a "cause for concern, not a cause for panic."UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD ON OMICRON: NO PROOF COVID-19 VACCINES WON'T PREVENT AGAINST SEVERE DISEASEPsaki echoed the president’s tone and said the best way to ward off the latest variant is still to get vaccinated."Here’s what we do know: getting vaccinated, getting boosted, means that you increase antibodies and you will have additional protection," she told reporters on Air Force One Tuesday."If there’s a need for a changing, a tweaking of vaccine, getting that to the market – we will be prepared to do exactly that, but we are not at that point yet," she continued. "We don’t know yet and we’re going to wait for the results and the analysis of health and medical experts."Bancel warned it could take several months for pharma companies to establish a vaccine effective enough to combat the omicron variant.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPWhile the omicron variant is expected to bring with it a resurgence in cases, Pfizer board member Scott Gottlieb, and former commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, told CBS News this week that there’s "a pretty good degree of confidence" that with three doses of the coronavirus vaccine individuals will be protected against the latest variant."The most important thing we can do is get more people vaccinated," Psaki said Tuesday.

Anyone who failed to comply would be forced to attend school remotely.Leah Lefkove, 9, covers her face as her dad Dr. Ben Lefkove gives her the first COVID-19 vaccine at the Viral Solutions vaccination and testing site in Decatur, Ga., on the first day COVID-19 vaccinations were available for children from 5 to 12 on Wednesday, Nov. 3, 2021. (AP Photo/Ben Gray)In October, counsel with the Thomas More Society filed a lawsuit on behalf of the family of a 16-year-old Scripps Ranch High School student, referred to as "Jane Doe" in the court documents. The suit argued that religious exemptions should be allowed if the school district also allows medical exemptions for pregnant students.JUDGE BLOCKS BIDEN VACCINE MANDATE FOR HEALTH CARE WORKERS IN 10 STATESMany religious objections to the vaccines cite alleged use of fetal tissue related to their development. None of the COVID-19 vaccines contain fetal cells, but fetal cell lines, which are grown in a lab from decades-old fetal tissue, wereutilizedin the research and development of the vaccines dispensed by Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson.FILE PHOTO: An employee shows the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine at Northwell Health's Long Island Jewish Valley Stream hospital in New York, U.S., December 21, 2020.(REUTERS/Eduardo Munoz)"The injunction shall be in effect only while a 'per se' deferral of vaccination is available to pregnant students under San Diego Unified School District’s COVID-19 vaccination mandate," Judges Marsha Berzon and Mark Bennett wrote in theruling. "The injunction shall terminate upon removal of the ‘per se’ deferral option for pregnant students.""I concur in granting Doe’s emergency motion for an injunction pending appeal," Judge Sandra Ikuta said. "But I would keep the injunction in effect until the San Diego Unified School District ceases to treat any students (not just pregnant students) seeking relief from the vaccination mandate for secular reasons more favorably than students seeking relief for religious reasons, because any unvaccinated student attending in-person classes poses the same risk to the school district’s interest in ensuring a safe school environment."A nurse gives a girl a dose of the Pfizer vaccine at a COVID-19 vaccine clinic at Lyman High School in Longwood on the day before classes begin for the 2021-22 school year.(Paul Hennessy/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)Describing SDUSD's vaccine as "one of the harshest in the nation," Thomas More Society attorney Paul Jonna said in a statement provided to Fox News that the court order was "a significant victory," despite the case being in its early stages."SDUSD should promptly revise its policy to include religious exemptions for students. Otherwise, we are confident that we will fully vindicate our clients’ rights either in the Ninth Circuit or in the U.S. Supreme Court, if necessary," Jonna said.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP"The COVID regime of secular favorites but religious outcasts must end," Jonna added. "There is no vaccine exception to the Free Exercise Clause.

Plus, how he bailed on a speech he was supposed to give on the supply chain crisis.A federal court haltedPresident Biden’sCOVID-19vaccine mandate for health care workers in 10 states."The scale falls clearly in favor of healthcare facilities operating with some unvaccinated employees, staff, trainees, students, volunteers and contractors, rather than the swift, irremediable impact of requiring healthcare facilities to choose between two undesirable choices — providing substandard care or providing no healthcare at all," wrote U.S. District Judge Matthew Schelp in a32-page orderMonday.President Joe Biden.(AP Photo/Evan Vucci)OSHA SUSPENDS ENFORCEMENT OF COVID-19 VACCINE MANDATE FOR LARGE BUSINESSESThe 10 states impacted by the ruling are those that sued the Biden administration over the rule: Alaska, Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming.Biden's Nov. 5 order applied to health workers in hospitals that receive federal funding through Medicaid or Medicare, with Biden arguing that the rule was needed to help slow the spread of COVID-19 among the nation's health care workers.But Schelp ruled the order likely exceeded Biden's authority, giving the ten states a temporary victory as the case continues to wind its way through the system."Congress did not clearly authorize CMS to enact this politically and economically vast, federalism-altering, and boundary-pushing mandate, which Supreme Court precedent requires," Schelp wrote.FILE - In this Oct. 5, 2021, file photo a healthcare worker fills a syringe with the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine.

(REUTERS/Caitlin Ochs)(REUTERS/Caitlin Ochs)Cuomo, who resigned in August amid multiple scandals, prioritized his Emmy-winning televised press conferences above all else, which "diverted people’s attention to service the press conference instead of servicing the running of the state," a former Department of Health staffer said."It became more about the press conference and about the issue that he was talking about at the press conference," the staffer said.Cuomo "was managing by press release, by press conference. If he saw a bad story he pivoted, and we reacted to it, the policies reacted to it. Everyone who worked with him put up with it. But he got a lot of kudos," a member of the former governor's COVID-19 task force told Politico.In the summer of 2020, Cuomo reportedly asked the state health department to deploy an "army" of roughly 5,000 employees to enforce COVID-19-related rules at restaurants, because he wanted to publicly tout his crackdown on violators. An official charged with the deployment called it an "impossible request" and said he ended up only enlisting 50 employees."[T]op officials quickly formed a plan they hoped would placate the mercurial governor until he moved on to some other idea," Politico reported. "It worked, and became just one of several subterfuges state health officials concocted to deal with demands from the governor’s office they believed to be based in politics, not science. That continuous pressure from Cuomo's office contributed to dozens of high-level staff departures in the months after New York became the global epicenter for the viral outbreak, according to several people who worked on the state’s Covid response."New York Governor Andrew Cuomo (L) and Michaela Kennedy-Cuomo are seen at the Eastside Heliport in Midtown on August 10, 2021 in New York City. (Photo by Gotham/GC Images)Cuomo’s spokesperson, Rich Azzopardi, blasted the allegations reported by Politico."These are second or third hand interpretations from an employee whose only interaction with the Governor or his top staff was during a live COVID briefing and the fact that this line of questioning was even pursued in this unrelated matter speaks volumes about how this entire situation was politicized and weaponized," Azzopardi said in a statement."This pandemic was unprecedented, there was zero support from the federal government and — as was the case with many other governors — it required a centralized all-hands-on-deck response," he said. "We listened to the evolving science, but pushed back against the bureaucracy and the bureaucracy has been trying to get even every day since."TheNew Yorkstate Assembly Judiciary Committee released a report last week that said it found "overwhelming evidence" that Cuomo engaged in multiple instances of sexual harassment while in office, and that Cuomo tasked top state officials with helping him develop his book, "American Crisis: Leadership Lessons from the COVID-19 Pandemic."One senior official even complained that working on the book was compromising his or her ability to work on COVID-related matters, the report said.Governor Andrew Cuomo holds a press briefing and makes announcement to combat COVID-19 Delta variant at 633 3rd Avenue on Aug. 2, 2021. (Photo by Lev Radin/Pacific Press/LightRocket via Getty Images)Cuomo "utilized state resources and property, including work by Executive Chamber staff, to write, publish, and promote his book regarding his handling of the COVID-19 crisis – a project for which he was guaranteed at least $5.2 million in personal profit," the report said.Investigators also found that the Cuomo administration "was not fully transparent" with the American people about the number of nursing home residents who died as a result of COVID-19, and that out-of-facility deaths were deliberately left out of a published state Department of Health report, which Cuomo had a significant hand in editing and revising after he faced criticism for his handling of nursing homes during the pandemic.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThe report also said state health Commissioner Howard Zucker, the only medical professional on Cuomo’s COVID-19 task force, did not have regular meetings with the former governor during the pandemic and "did not feel able to speak freely" to the former governor, "as advice that was contrary to the Chamber’s views was often rejected."Cuomo has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and has vehemently defended his pandemic response.Jessica Chasmar is a reporter for Fox News Digital.

Circuit that claimed Biden’s vaccine mandate, enforced by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), represents a "gross abuse of power" and "clearly encroaches on the police power of states expressly reserved by the Tenth Amendment."OSHA SUSPENDS ENFORCEMENT OF COVID-19 VACCINE MANDATE FOR LARGE BUSINESSESPresident Biden delivers remarks at the start of a hybrid virtual roundtable with CEOs and leaders of retail, consumer products firms, and grocery store chains in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building on Nov. 29, 2021 in Washington, D.C. (Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)The lawsuit says the mandate also "exceeds the federal government’s authority under the Commerce Clause," and would "impermissibly" compel citizens "to act as the Government would have them act."Incoming Heritage president Kevin Roberts, who takes office Wednesday, said the lawsuit is unusual for the think tank but necessary."The Heritage Foundation has not historically filed lawsuits," Roberts said in a statement. "That we are doing so now should make clear to any observer that we view this mandate as deadly serious threat to our individual liberty and the values that make America great. Under my predecessors, The Heritage Foundation has stood rock-solid in defense of liberty, freedom, and opportunity for all, and it will continue to do so under my leadership.""I wish this lawsuit were unnecessary," he continued. "I wish we had an administration in the White House that respected the Constitution and the rule of law. From the unprecedented border crisis, to the disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal, to now this unlawful COVID vaccine mandate, it is irrevocably clear that this administration will stop at nothing—even harming Americans and our national interests—in pursuit of the most radical policy agenda in American history.

"We'll have to face this new threat like we've faced those that have come before it."The president, though, stressed that the omicron variant is a "cause for concern, not a cause for panic.""We have the best vaccine in the world, the best medicines, the best scientists, and we're learning more every single day," he said, adding that the U.S. "will fight this variant with scientific and knowledgeable action and speed – not chaos and confusion."Biden said the U.S. has "more tools today" to fight the omicron variant than the country has had before, citing vaccines and boosters for adults, and vaccines for children.The president stressed the importance of getting vaccinated, saying the shots are "the best protection against this new variant, or any out there."Amid concern that the new omicron variant could be resistant to current vaccines, the president stressed that the administration is working to accelerate development of updated vaccinations if needed."In the event, hopefully unlikely, that updated vaccinations or boosters are needed to respond to this new variant, we will accelerate their development and deployment with every available tool," Biden said. "We do not yet believe that additional measures will be needed."CLICK FOR THE LATEST ON THE CORONAVIRUSBiden, though, said his administration is working with Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson for "contingency plans if needed," and will direct the Food and Drug Administration to get those potential vaccines approved and on the market if needed "without cutting any corners.""I am sparing no effort and removing all road blocks to keep the American people safe," Biden said.The president said that the White House plans to release an updated strategy to fight COVID-19 during the winter months – a strategy, he said, that would not involve "shut downs or lock downs," but instead, "more widespread vaccinations, testing and more."The president stressed that individuals, whether vaccinated or not, should be wearing masks and face coverings in public settings again.When pressed on why he was taking shut downs off the table, the president said: "If people are vaccinated and wearing their masks, there is no need for the lock downs."Meanwhile, Biden maintained the importance of sharing vaccination supply around the globe, saying that he will "always make sure our people are protected first," but warned that both the delta and omicron variants of COVID-19 emerged "elsewhere in the world."OMICRON VARIANT: HERE’S WHAT OFFICIALS KNOW"So we can't let up until the world is vaccinated," Biden said.Last week, the president followed the advice of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Dr. Anthony Fauci in his move to restrict travel from several African nations, after the identification of the variant, which officials said appears to be highly contagious among young people. Travel restrictions do not apply to American citizens and lawful permanent residents, but all international travelers must test negative prior to travel.Biden, on Monday, said his administration has no plans to extend travel restrictions to other countries at this point.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThe World Health Organization said that it could take some time to get a full picture of the threat posed by omicron. Over the weekend, WHO said that it wasn't clear whether omicron is more transmissible – more easily spread between people – compared to other variants, and said it was not yet clear whether infection with omicron would cause more severe disease.Cases of the omicron variant have been detected in African countries, as well as the Netherlands, Denmark, Australia, Canada, Italy, Israel, Hong Kong, Belgium, Germany, Great Britain, and France.The Associated Press contributed to this report.Brooke Singman is a Fox News Digital politics reporter.

As a result, he has been promised that he will lose his job, according to the lawsuit."No matter how much any president wants to attack some specific problems … that desire to address the issue does not provide the president with independent authority to do something about it," Hamilton said in an interview with Fox News.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.ALBANY, N.Y.  — TheNew YorkAssembly's investigation into former Gov.Andrew Cuomo's conduct in office concluded the Democrat's administration misrepresented how many nursing home residents died ofCOVID-19, according to a lawmaker who reviewed the committee's still-secret report.Assembly Member Phil Steck was among the Assembly Judiciary Committee members who were able to review a copy of the approximately 45-page report Thursday and Friday in advance of its public release, possibly as soon as next week.The report, compiled by theNew York Citylaw firm Davis Polk & Wardwell, covers a wide array of allegations of misconduct by Cuomo, includingsexual harassmentclaims and the participation of his staff in writing his book on the coronavirus pandemic.NEW YORK ETHICS BOARD RESCINDS CUOMO BOOK DEAL APPROVAL PUTTING HIS $5.1 MILLION IN PROCEEDS AT RISKOther topics include the Cuomo administration's manipulation of data on COVID-19 deaths as presented to the public.The AssociatedPressand other news organizations reported on gaps in the state's statistical accounting of fatalities, including the administration's decision to exclude from its nursing home death totalsthousands of patients who died afterbeing transferred to hospitals.Former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo.The Davis Polk investigators confirmed press reports that the state Department of Health wanted to include those hospital deaths in the state's nursing home fatality count."The investigation showed that as they were considering these matters, the book deal was going on, there's a chapter in the book about nursing homes," said Steck, a Democrat who represents part of the Albany area. "They were trying to make it as what they thought was least damaging to the governor instead of just telling the truth."Cuomo’s resignation in August stymied the law firm’s efforts to interview witnesses about the misrepresentation of nursing home data, according to Assembly Member Mary Beth Walsh, a Republican."I believe that the timing of the governor’s resignation really kind of truncated the investigation and the ability to investigate on that," said Walsh, whose district includes parts of Saratoga and Schenectady counties. "Several individuals who were scheduled to be subpoenaed did not cooperate after the governor’s resignation.""I believe that the timing of the governor’s resignation really kind of truncated the investigation and the ability to investigate on that. Several individuals who were scheduled to be subpoenaed did not cooperate after the governor’s resignation."New York state Assembly Member Mary Beth Walsh, RepublicanCuomo administration officials, at the time, acknowledged that their nursing home fatality count was incomplete, but said that was only because it would take time to verify the data. Health officials insisted it was not an attempt to make the state's death toll look better or protect Cuomo's reputation.Cuomo's spokesperson, Rich Azzopardi, said Friday that the former governor and his team still hadn't been allowed to see a copy of the Assembly report, or all the investigators' evidence."The Assembly Judiciary Committee has chosen not to review their findings with us which is their prerogative, but it may once again result in a one-sided report," Azzopardi said.Cuomo resigned in Augustto avoid a likely impeachment trial in the wake ofanother investigationthat found he sexually harassed 11 women. That investigation was led by two independent investigators hired by the state's attorney general.Walsh said the report presented "overwhelming evidence" that Cuomo harassed the women who came forward.Cuomo, who now faces a criminal charge thathe groped an aide's breast,has denied touching anyone inappropriately.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPOn the subject of Cuomo's$5.1 million book deal,Steck said the report makes "very clear" that the then-governor violated conditions set by the state ethics committee, which had said Cuomo couldn't use state resources or staff on the project.Investigators found that Cuomo ordered some state employees to work on the book, and while some said they volunteered their private time to do so, Steck said "there wasn’t enough time in the day for it to be voluntary work and for them to still be able to work on official state business."Ethics commissioners this weekrescinded their approval of Cuomo’s book deal.Walsh, a former Saratoga assistant county attorney, said that could "open the door" to an ethics fine.Get all the stories you need-to-know from the most powerful name in news delivered first thing every morning to your inboxSubscribedYou've successfully subscribed to this newsletter!This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2022 FOX News Network, LLC.

President Biden’s authoritarian mandate on employees of federal contractors requiring vaccination or termination is unfair to those who support the federal government and jeopardizes services such as defense and border security," Comer, ranking member of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, told Fox News in a statement.Rep. James Comer speaks during a House Oversight and Reform Committee hearing. (Jonathan Ernst-Pool/Getty Images)"Because of the sweeping mandate, employees risk losing their entire livelihoods – jobs, pensions and health care plans – and President Biden places our country at risk to public safety, health and supply chain crises," he said.All House Oversight Republicans have signed the bill.Biden issued anexecutive orderon Sept. 9 requiring federal contractors to ensure their employees receive the COVID-19 vaccine without the option of getting a weekly COVID-19 test.The president said in his Sept. 9 order that the mandate would "decrease the spread of COVID-19, which will decrease worker absence, reduce labor costs, and improve the efficiency of contractors and subcontractors at sites where they are performing work for the Federal Government."President Biden receives a COVID-19 booster shot on the White House campus, Monday, Sept. 27, 2021, in Washington.

The decision was the latest development in what is expected to be a lengthy legal battle over the mandate’s legality.Comer's office told Fox News that due to the Fifth Circuit Court's decision to suspend businesses with more than 100 employees from requiring vaccinations, federal contractors will now be subject to a mandate that ordinary businesses are at least temporarily exempt from implementing.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPComer and other Oversight Republican lawmakers also recentlysent a letterto Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, General Services Administration Secretary Robin Carnahan and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Acting Director Shalanda Young asking for information and documents related to the president's federal contractor vaccine mandate.Rep.

Ron DeSantis signed a package of anti-COVID-19 vaccine mandate bills into law Thursday in Brandon, Florida – a thinly veiled jab at President Biden.In a rebuke to theWhite House, the legislative package prevents some workers from being required to get vaccinated. Employers will be required to allow exemptions including, but not limited to health or religious concerns; pregnancy or anticipated future pregnancy; and past recovery from COVID-19."We were here to celebrate a great city in the state of Florida, a freedom city, and it's important that when you have the federal government overreaching, like Joe Biden's doing, that we signed legislation to protect Floridians," DeSantis told Fox News.

What it means to have a sincerely held faith."Bills that would provide school mask mandate exemptions, prevent vaccine status "discrimination," prevent employers from asking employees about vaccine status, prohibit requiring proof of vaccination to enter or use state-owned public venues and that would provide employees medical, religious, philosophical and natural immunity exemptions for all vaccines also passed.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPIdaho’s House and Senate both declared opposition in a voice vote toPresident Biden’svaccine mandate for federal workers and contractors and vaccine requirements for large employers and health care employers.Get all the stories you need-to-know from the most powerful name in news delivered first thing every morning to your inboxSubscribedYou've successfully subscribed to this newsletter!This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2022 FOX News Network, LLC.

Most agencies also assess with low confidence that SARS-CoV-2 probably was not genetically engineered; however, two agencies believe there was not sufficient evidence to make an assessment either way. Finally, the IC assesses China’s officials did not have foreknowledge of the virus before the initial outbreak of COVID-19 emerged."The report stated that China would need to fully cooperate with the investigation in order to definitively conclude where the virus originated."China’s cooperation most likely would be needed to reach a conclusive assessment of the origins of COVID-19," the report stated. "Beijing, however, continues to hinder the global investigation, resist sharing information and blame other countries, including the United States.

SCOTT ATLAS UNLOADS ON FAUCI, BIRX, REDFIELD IN FORTHCOMING MEMOIR: 'I WAS DISGUSTED'"The four-month period during my service as an adviser to the president of the United States provides a candid perspective on how our leaders functioned in the greatest health care crisis in the past century — the pandemic and its management —without the distorting sense of media and politics," Atlas told Fox News.Atlas said his book also "clarifies the facts underlying the pandemic, free from the filter of government bureaucrats, the media, and politically-biased academics and scientists," while also exposing "profound issues in our society" that he warned "could interfere with our ability to address future crises and threaten the very principles of freedom and order that we often take for granted and that the rest of the world depends on."Atlas told Fox News that his book "exposes the unvarnished truth" about the COVID-19 Task Force under the Trump administration, COVID data and issues within the nation that were "exposed by the management of the pandemic."Atlas slammed "those leading America’s public health" during the onset of the COVID pandemic as "failures.""With their draconian measures focused on one thing, stopping COVID cases at all costs instead of considering all of health harms, and a shocking lack of critical thinking about the science, this was a reckless abuse of public health and a moral failure in what should be expected from public health leaders," Atlas said. "Inflicting enormous harms with lockdowns and restrictions, they failed to protect the elderly, they failed to stop the spread of the infection, they failed to stop the deaths - all the while destroying lower income families and sacrificing the health of our children, while sparing the affluent and the elite."Atlas added that "trust in America’s institutions has been severely damaged.""Science itself has been politicized, while universities and the media prohibit the free exchange of ideas necessary to solve future crises," Atlas said. "This book is a first step toward restoring that trust by exposing the truth."He added: "And truth matters."Atlas jointed the Trump White House COVID-19 Task Force in August 2020 as a special government employee, serving just a 130-day detail. Atlas' role expired in November 2020.Atlas was criticized throughout his time at the White House for advocating for a reopening while blasting COVID-19 lockdowns as "extremely harmful" to Americans.SCOTT ATLAS DEFENDS COVID WORK, SLAMS DEBORAH BIRX TESTIMONY AS 'ORWELLIAN ATTEMPT TO REWRITE HISTORY'Meanwhile, Atlas has been at odds with Trump's coronavirus response coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx, defending himself after reports of her closed-door testimony before the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis last month.CNN first reported Friday that part of Birx’s testimony included comments suggesting that Atlas sought to change COVID-19 testing guidance, and called for less testing for those without symptoms.Atlas, reacting to Birx’s testimony, said it was her "desperate attempt" to "deflect blame for her failed policies she advised."CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP"At no time did I try to reduce testing or in any way ‘interfere’ with any CDC guidance," Atlas told Fox News, adding that his efforts "were always focused on increasing testing and smartly using the administration’s massive testing apparatus to save more lives.""While in Washington, I worked hard specifically to increase testing, especially in nursing homes and staff, in historically black colleges, in senior centers, and elsewhere, to protect Americans and stop the dying - and those efforts were successfully implemented," Atlas told Fox News. "From my arrival into the Task Force in mid August until I left Washington in late November, testing increased from about 700,000 to 1.4 million per day."He added: "Any blame for that failure lies on those who advised what was actually implemented, not on those who criticized the lockdowns and tried to stop the death and destruction."Brooke Singman is a Fox News Digital politics reporter.

They are also to tell employees that they must receive their final vaccination shot by Nov. 8 to be fully vaccinated by the deadline.FILE - A Border Patrol agent talks to migrants after they were detained and taken into custody, March 21, 2021, in Abram-Perezville, Texas. Biden took office on Jan. 20 and almost immediately, numbers of migrants exceeded expectations. (AP Photo/Julio Cortez, File)"Supervisors who fail to have the required discussions with their employees will be subject to potential discipline for insubordination, up to removal from federal service," the email says.The email includes "discussion points" and a discussion log that supervisors are required to submit.Additionally, a Border Patrol source told Fox that in the coming weeks supervisors will be expected to hold counseling sessions for employees who are unvaccinated to set up a vaccination timeline. Should employees fail to comply, then they will be suspended and the termination process will begin, the source said. The source also described a work environment where agents are peppered with multiple emails a day on the subject, including videos of CBP or Homeland Security employees affected by COVID-19.A CBP spokesperson told Fox News the agency does not comment on purportedly leaked information or documents, but said that CBP, along with other federal agencies are "laser-focused on vaccinating their workforce ahead of the November 22nd deadline for Federal employees.""Like other Federal agencies, we are continuing to collect vaccination information from employees as we approach the deadline," the spokesperson said.Former acting CBP Commissioner Mark Morgan told Fox News that the fact that the agency is having to push supervisors so hard shows that the mandate has been a "colossal failure across the board.""One sure indicator that your policy is way off is when you can't get your subordinate field leadership to comply. When you're having to strong-arm your field leadership to force compliance, that's a red flag," Morgan, who served as acting CBP chief during the Trump administration, said.Morgan hadpreviously provided Fox Newswith internal CBP data that show that as of Oct 25, 48% of Border Patrol agents have not responded to the reporting mandate, and that 90% of those who had had received at least one dose. Among CBP more broadly, 32% of staff have not responded and of those that did 84% have received at least one vaccine shot.VACCINE MANDATES COULD LEAD TO POLICE AND FIREFIGHTER EXODUSES IN URBAN AREASMuch of the focus has been on the impact on Border Patrol in the midst of the crisis at the southern border, where more than 192,000 migrants were encountered in September alone and more than 1.7 million in Fiscal Year 2021. However, Border Patrol is just one part of CBP, and so the ramifications of a loss of staff beyond Border Patrol would have effects in other parts of CBP’s mission as well -- including ports of entry and elsewhere.Morgan highlighted the time commitment it would take to coordinate meetings with tens of thousands of CBP employees."They have to develop databases, they have to develop policy, send it out and now they mandate every single supervisor speak to every single one of the 64,000 employees -- just think of the man hours it takes to do that alone," he said.He said that, at least for Border Patrol, many of those not complying have in fact been vaccinated but are taking a stand against what they see as a politically-motivated mandate."This is not about anti-vaccine, this is about this is one of the rare opportunities for Border Patrol agents specifically, they feel they have an opportunity to make a statement, take a stand."CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPMultiple Border Patrol agents who have spoken to Fox News in recent months have echoed that sentiment and have told Fox they are vaccinated but object to the mandate, particularly considering there is no such mandate for those crossing the border illegally."For two years Border Patrol agents have had to go on the line risking their lives and apprehend illegal aliens," Morgan said. "And now according to ‘the science’ they have to get vaccinated or lose their job but the very illegal aliens they're apprehending, they don't have to get vaccinated -- that's nonsensical. That’s not following the science."Fox News' Tyler O'Neill contributed to this report.Adam Shaw is a politics reporter for Fox News Digital, with a focus on immigration.

Roger Marshall of Kansas and Joni Ernst of Iowa and Democratic Sens. Diane Feinstein of California and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, this new commission would also examine not only the U.S. pandemic response and aim to ensure it never happens again, but it would also allow sanctions to be placed on laboratories that won’t cooperate and even against China.FLORIDA HOSPITAL CELEBRATES ZERO COVID PATIENTS FOR FIRST TIME SINCE 2020Sen.

The Build Back Better plan would replace the $7,000 maximum to $70,000.

And sometime it differs," Psaki said."I would just go back to what our view is, is that we’re still going through a hard time in this country," she continued. "And people are tired of fighting the pandemic, they’re tired of the impact on their lives."Psaki then continued the Biden administration's strategy ofblaming others, specifically the unvaccinated, for the president's dismal approval ratings."Some of them are sick and tired of people who won’t get vaccinated, who they feel are impacting their ability to live life in a normal way," Psaki said. "Some people are still fearful for loved ones.""And we all thought it would be over at this point in time," Psaki added.Psaki made the claim at the White House’s Friday press conference as Biden’s approval ratings plummet the furthest than any president since World War II.New polling from Gallup shows that Biden’s approval rating dropped from 56% in Q1 to 44.7% in Q3 which represents an 11.3% drop that has not been experienced by any president since World War II.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPBiden’s approval rating started to significantly drop over the summer as the nation continues to battle through the coronavirus pandemic and restrictions put in place by elected officials, including Biden who has faced widespread criticism for imposing federal vaccine mandates.The president’s approval fell even further in September after his chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan that resulted in the deaths of 13 U.S. service members and left Americans behind, despite promises from his administration that wouldn’t occur.Biden repeatedly promised during the2020 presidential campaignthat he would "shut down" COVID-19 if elected.

"But, we all know thatrespiratory viruses… tend to thrive in winter months andcolder weather. So, right now is not the time, as cases are coming down, to become complacent because we do know colder weather is ahead of us and we need to do all that we can – including vaccinating those 66 million people who have not yet been vaccinated – all we can in our prevention measures and our vaccination efforts to make sure that we don't become complacent during this period of time."Walensky also said that the administration will be working to "scale-out pediatric vaccination" after authorization from the Food and Drug Administration and recommendations from CDC experts.PFIZER-BIONTECH SUBMIT COVID-19 VACCINE DATA TO FDA FOR KIDS 5-11"It will take some time and as I just noted, as we head into these winter months we know we cannot be complacent.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.TheWhite Houseon Wednesday unveiled avaccinationrollout plan for children ages 5 to 11 ahead of a possible authorization to administerCOVIDshots to children by the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The start of a COVID vaccination program for children ages 5-11 is dependent on the "independent FDA and CDC process and timeline," which is set for later this month, and early November, the White House said. The administration rolled out the plan so it "will be ready to begin getting shots in arms in the days following a final CDC recommendation."PFIZER-BIONTECH SUBMIT COVID-19 VACCINE DATA TO FDA FOR KIDS 5-11Pfizer and BioNTech requested FDA emergency authorization of theirCOVID-19vaccinefor children ages 5 to 11 earlier this month.The Biden administration's plan is set to mobilize a "comprehensive effort" across the public and private sectors to ensure the supply, sites and support are available to get children "vaccinated and protected against the virus."The administration said it has procured enough vaccine to support vaccinating the 28 million children in the U.S. between the ages of 5 and 11 years old.A nurse gives a girl a dose of the Pfizer vaccine at a COVID-19 vaccine clinic at Lyman High School in Longwood on the day before classes begin for the 2021-22 school year. (Photo by Paul Hennessy/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)(Paul Hennessy/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)"If authorized by the FDA and recommended by the CDC, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for 5-11 year olds will be a dose and formula specifically for this age group," the White House said. "The vaccine will have packaging available in smaller configurations that will make it easier for physicians’ offices and other smaller, community-based providers to offer the vaccine to kids and their families."Pending the FDA's authorization, the packaging configuration would be 10-dose vials in cartons of 10 vials each (100 doses total) delivered in a newly updated product shipper. Officials said the vaccine can then be stored for up to 10 weeks at standard refrigeration temperature, and six months at ultracold temperatures.The administration also plans to make vaccination "accessible and conveniently located" to families across the country, by creating vaccination clinics at doctors' offices, hospitals, pharmacies, community health centers, and school-and community-based sites. Officials said more than 25,000 pediatric and primary care provider sites will provide vaccines for children, as well as tens of thousands of other provider locations.Meanwhile, to ensure parents "have the information they need to make informed choices for their families," the Department of Health and Human Services is set to conduct a national public education campaign to reach parents and guardians with "accurate and culturally-responsive information about the vaccine and the risks that COVID-19 poses to children."PFIZER, BIONTECH REQUEST COVID-19 VACCINE EMERGENCY AUTHORIZATION FOR KIDS AGES 5 TO 11The campaign is set to "invest heavily" in "trusted messengers; work with schools, state and local health departments, faith leaders, and national and community organizations to increase vaccine confidence; create forums for parents to ask questions to pediatricians; and reach out to parents directly through press and social media across channels and in multiple languages.""Central to this work will be close collaboration with the major national organizations, and their local affiliates, that reach families across the country – including provider and parent organizations and other key partners from across the public and private sectors," officials said.Meanwhile, for those families that do not have a consistent medical provider for their children, the surgeon general is set to enlist pediatricians and community leaders to talk to Americans "directly" via social media channels and through visits to hard-hit and high-risk communities.As for whether public schools across the country will begin to require COVID vaccinations for children, administration officials said school vaccination requirements "have been around for decades," but that those decisions will be made at the state and local levels.The potential plan for kid ages 5-11 comes after millions of adolescents between the ages of 12 and 17 have been "safely vaccinated," the administration said."We know vaccines work," the White House said.

Mike Braun, R-Ind., who says the officers "deserve respect."In a statement to Fox News, Braun said, "Our police do the hardest job in the world, and they deserve respect — not losing their pay or being fired for refusing to comply with a ridiculous vaccine mandate."CHICAGO POLICE BRASS REQUEST VACCINE UPDATES FROM PERSONNEL, MAY DENY BENEFITS TO OFFICERS CHOOSING TO RETIREBraun is welcoming officers to the state with arms wide open, urging the "3,000 Chicago cops defying this government overreach" to come to Indiana."Indiana’s police departments are hiring now and will welcome you with the respect you deserve," Braun told Fox News.A woman holds a sign in Bloomington, Indiana, that says "Defend the Police." (Photo by Jeremy Hogan/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)(Getty images)"My office stands ready to help connect Chicago police officers to an Indiana police department that is hiring now and doesn’t have a vaccine mandate," Braun said. "Welcome to Indiana!"During an interview with Fox News, Steve Scheckel, chief of police in Munster, Indiana, echoed Braun's sentiment and insisted there is a "brighter future right over the border" for officers who are under scrutiny for their views on vaccine mandates, noting that his department has already hired one individual from Chicago."We've been seeing more and more Chicago police officers when we do an emergency hire, which is basically a lateral transfer. They already have the academy" Scheckel said, adding that he is "absolutely" open to the idea of working alongside those "looking for a better quality of life for their family" who may have been ousted from their jobs.LAW ENFORCEMENT BLAME 'DEFUND THE POLICE,' LIBERAL PROSECUTORS FOR DRAMATIC SPIKE IN ASSAULTS ON POLICEAsked about the types of opportunities officers could have if they were to relocate to Munster, Scheckel pointed to education, the cost of living, tax rates and low-crime rates."Here in northwest Indiana, in Munster, we have one of the top rated school systems in the state," Scheckel said. "[Officers] can send their kids to public school. It's a low-crime community. Even though we're 30 minutes from Chicago, we're rated one of the 10 safest cities in the state of Indiana. So, it's really just a step across the state line to a better life for the officer.""From the governor on down, in Indiana, we support our law enforcement," said Scheckel, who has been with the department for more than 30 years, serving as police chief for the last 13. "I think there's a clear contrast between what's going on in the city of Chicago right now and what's happening in the state of Indiana."CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPHighlighting the "trying and stressful" times for first responders over the last couple of years, Scheckel said the "mandates that really aren't rooted in science" appear to be "politically motivated" and suggested they are the "straw that broke the camel's back."Other police departments in Indiana that do not have a vaccine mandate in place, according to Braun's team, include Schererville Police Department and Merrillville Police Department, as well as the Lake County Sheriff's Office.Chicago police officials made it clear last week that officers who refused to comply with the city’s mandate risk being disciplined or fired.

Colin Powell, seen here in New York City in 2017, died from COVID-19 complications, his family announced.(Daniel Zuchnik/WireImage, File)Powell, the first Black secretary of state, served in Bush's Cabinet from 2001-2005, including during the tumultuous years following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. The State Department described Powell, a Republican, as being "one of the foremost supporters" of taking "swift military action" against al Qaeda. Powell demanded "immediate" cooperation from Afghanistan and Pakistan in the U.S. effort to hunt down those responsible for the attacks.By 2003, when the Bush administration’s focus had expanded to Iraq, Powell pushed for United Nations inspectors to investigate the claims that Saddam Hussein was manufacturing weapons of mass destruction. Powell presented intelligence to the U.N. in February 2003 that supported the administration’s claim that Iraq did have weapons of mass destruction and had the capabilities of producing more. In 2004, though, the State Department said some of the intelligence he presented was "found to be erroneous." Powell, though, according to the State Department, felt military action should not begin "until a large coalition of allies and a long-term occupation plan were in place." Despite his advice, the administration moved toward preemptive military action against Iraq.Former Deputy National Security Advisor K.T. McFarland joined 'Fox & Friends' following the news of Colin Powell's passing Monday.While the majority of his term as secretary of state was focused on Afghanistan and Iraq, the State Department said Powell pursued other areas of U.S. foreign policy –including strengthening bilateral relationships with Russia and China – including his efforts to manage the U.S. withdrawal from the U.S.-Russian Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty, and the signing of the Moscow Treaty on Strategic Offensive Reductions in May 2002.Powell also pushed for international cooperation for North Korea and Iran to halt their nuclear weapons program. Under his leadership, the Bush administration also achieved nonproliferation success in Libya, when it agreed to give up its nuclear weapons program in 2003, according to the State Department.Powell, during his time at the State Department, also pushed the Bush administration to increase its commitment to the international fight against AIDS, and helped to secure additional funding.Gen.

Phil Murphy, Democratic National Convention co-chair, joins Chris Wallace with insight on 'Fox News Sunday.'New Jersey GovernorPhilMurphywas caught maskless at an indoor ball weeks after imposing a mask mandate for young children in school.The Democratic governor attended the Equality Ball on Friday put on by the nonprofit Garden State Equality with other New Jersey officials at the Asbury Lanes in Asbury Park, a part of the Monmouth County that has the highest risk of COVID-19 transmission,accordingto the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.That didn't stop the party, though, as Murphy – who is up for reelection this year – and the other attendees were caught with their masks down.CHRIS CHRISTIE SLAMS PHIL MURPHY OVER NJ DEM’S ITALY VACATIONAttendees to the dinner weremaskless, as revealed by pictures posted online, and Murphy as well as Rep. Frank Pallone, D-N.J., were seen not wearing masks.Several state lawmakers spoke out on the governor’s maskless gallivanting.State Senator Holly Schepisi told Fox News in an email statement that the maskless party "is this type of hypocrisy that is driving people in New Jersey insane.""At the very same time that this Governor issued another EO mandating two year olds wear masks for upwards of 7 hours a day because of purported ‘safety,’ the New Jersey political democratic elite gathered maskless by the thousands at multiple indoor events throughout the State, including in "high-risk" Asbury Park, Bergen and Hudson Counties," Schepisi continued."The people of New Jersey are being told by this administration that they must comply, don't ask questions or get labeled a knucklehead or worse while those demanding compliance flout the very policies they push," she added. "It is wrong."Schepisi’s fellow state Senator Michael Testa said that the maskless merrymaking was "another example of Murphy’s hypocrisy as he continues to force pointless pandemic mandates on regular New Jerseyans that he and other elite Democrats cavalierly ignore when they think nobody is watching.""We can imagine King Murphy saying to the laughter of his court, 'Let them wear masks,’" he added.New Jersey has mask requirements for a small scope of situations,such asin schools, public transportation and healthcare settings, but generally does not require masks for citizens. Instead, the governor's office highly recommends the use of masks "for both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals in indoor settings where there is increased risk."Murphy has spoken on his state's mask requirements, as well, recommending masks for people who don't know the vaccination status of the people around them if they are traveling or in a tightly packed space."I'm not talking about having dinner with your husband or wife at your table," Murphy said inSeptember.

"But that’s still several days away because we’re doing a very meticulous analysis of what is the next step that makes sense."De Blasio has floated a potential vaccine mandate for the NYPD, the nation's largest police department, for several weeks. The department's vaccination rate has lagged behind the rest of the city, with some officers flat out refusing to get the shots.As of Wednesday, 68% of the NYPD’s workforce was vaccinated, according to Commissioner Dermot Shea, compared with 76% of adult New Yorkers who have been fully vaccinated. The NYPD has about 34,500 uniformed personnel and about 17,700 people in non-uniformed support positions.STEVE FORBES ON DISMAL NEW JOBS REPORT: 'CRAZY, CONFUSING' MANDATES HURTING US ECONOMYThe discussion about a vaccine mandate heated up in recent days after Shea again said he’d support the move and fire Commissioner Daniel Nigro told reporters he’d favor the same for firefighters. At the same time, the Supreme Court denied a challenge to a city vaccine mandate for public school teachers, showing a potential legal pathway for expanding the requirement to other city agencies."We lost three members last week, two of them to COVID, and I think it's all unnecessary, to some degree," Sheasaidin August. "And I just, everyone I think, all across this country, really, should be embracing these vaccines."The state has mandated vaccines for health care workers and people in New York City must show proof of vaccination to eat indoors at restaurants or attend sporting events. De Blasio initially allowed public school teachers to get the vaccine or submit regular negative COVID-19 tests, but toughened the rule this summer by requiring all teachers to get a vaccine with no test-out option.Police departments across the country have been faced with the prospect of being forced to receive the coronavirus vaccine and in some cases it has prompted frustration from law enforcement.ASan Francisco, California, union representing local sheriffs' deputieswarnedin August that officers will quit or retire if they are forced to receive the coronavirus vaccine.LSU SUSPENDS VACCINATION AND NEGATIVE TEST REQUIREMENTS FOR FANSInSeattle, the police department is already facing a staffing crisis that is expected to become evenworsefrom forced vaccinations.The Seattle Police Department has already seen 124 "separations" through August of this year, according to their spokesman.

"We literally teach our students to be able to look at information critically before making a decision.""This was a blatant effort to coerce, manipulate, and even track information on students and their parents," Mess continued. "Anyone involved in this type of deception has lost their morals and purpose of education along the way."New Jersey state Sen. Holly Schepisi, a Republican, told Fox News in an email statement that while she supports people getting vaccinated, instructing teachers to use their positions of influence in students' and their families' lives to push certain medical decisions while politically canvassing using children's data is unethical and borderline criminal."I strongly support vaccinations and indeed have caught heat for encouraging others to get vaccinated," Schepisi wrote."However, to put our teachers in the untenable position of using their 'trust and influence' over children and their parents to persuade them to make personal medical decisions, and then encourage teachers through gift cards to input the names, addresses and vaccination status of these children and parents into a searchable political progressive database created for and by Congresswoman AOC's campaign team, is an unconscionable breach of privacy and ethics, it is political canvassing using children's data and it borders on criminal."According to the training reviewed by Fox News, teachers were encouraged to use Reach to "follow up and track" the conversations they had with parents and teachers, offering "gift cards" for the most active users."Look up the people you've talked to and mark down how your conversations went!" the training says with an "enter data" button at the end. "Then add them to your Reach network and add their contact info so that you or Made To Save can follow up with them later and help them get vaccinated."Teachers were also told they were a "trusted messenger" for students and instructed them to encourage others to get vaccinated in they were told to log on the progressive campaigning app."As someone the person already knows and trusts, you can find out what is concerning them about the vaccine, relate on a personal level, and share information to help them on their journey to get vaccinated," one slide read.Tips were also given on how to go about the recorded vaccine conversations."As an educator or school staff member, you are a trusted messenger for many students," Made to Save's tips for vaccine conversations read. "Use these tips to guide your conversations with them and help them stay safe and healthy!"The training also provided talking points for the educators, telling them to assume "people intend to get vaccinated unless they indicate otherwise" and to "adapt" the language to the "circumstances" they were in."Do you want me to help you get an appointment?" one talking point read."I'm excited to safely see my students and their families!" another read.The training also told teachers to listen for "what, if anything" is "holding" a person "back" from getting vaccinated and encouraged them to end vaccine conversations by planning "to check in a few weeks about vaccine concerns."Educators were also encouraged to help those with "barriers" in the way of getting a vaccine, such as a lack of transportation, by working with them to set up a "transportation plan" to get their shot."We are NOT telling people what to do or what they should think," the "Our Approach" slide reads. "We ARE listening to people and responding authentically to their concerns.""You do NOT need to be a healthcare expert to have good conversations," the slide continued. "To wrap up, help the person make a plan to get vaccinated, or plan to check in later about their concerns."One slide, entitled "Help Them Find Their Own Reason," encourages educators to do just that, telling them to not "tell them what to do or think" but also help their "friends and family find their own reason to get vaccinated.""The reasons that someone may choose to get vaccinated will always be those that are most compelling to them personally," the slide reads, offering an example of what to say to encourage a person to get vaccinated.Reach’s prototype was built for andemployedby Ocasio-Cortez’s successful 2018 campaign after being conceived by campaign operativeJake DeGroot.CRITICAL RACE THEORY OPPONENTS TO BE TARGETED, ‘RESEARCHED’ BY NEA TEACHERS’ UNIONAccording to DeGroot’s company biography, he had "a deep involvement in the Occupy Wall Street movement in 2011-2012" before moving on to Ocasio-Cortez’s congressional campaign and Reach itself."We built Reach for the Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez campaign as a tool for ourselves after we realized traditional door-to-door canvassing methods were limiting who we were talking to and when we were able to effectively collect data in the field," the website’s "About" page reads."Reach allowed us to canvass in the streets, subway stops, and community events in so many new ways that it revolutionized the way we connected with voters," the page continues. "This is a part of how we won, and we knew that other progressive people-powered campaigns could use it to win too."The "About" page also says the company believes "State and County Democratic parties are well-equipped to be leaders" for building voter bases and progressive grassroots efforts.A carousel on the website also showcases its work with Ocasio-Cortez's campaign.Reach's website also says it has clients that are "usually insurgent progressive campaigns, who may challenge the party establishment in their state and who have experienced discrimination, deprioritization, or even full-on opposition or hostility from their state party."CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThe teachers’ concern raises many questions on what the logged data is being used for and why the NEA is using a campaign tracking app to log conversations about theCOVID-19vaccine.Fox News asked both MTPS and the NEA why they are encouraging teachers to log vaccine conversations in a progressive voter-tracking app and if they believe that this approach to vaccine promotion will get more people vaccinated.Additionally, Fox News asked if students and parents would be informed if or when their conversations were being trapped and whether or not it was ethical or trustworthy for them to instruct teachers to submit people's personal conversations about their medical decisions to a clearly political organization."NEA members want nothing more than to return safely to in-person learning and science is clear that vaccinations are one of the best ways to keep students and educators safe and in the classroom," an NEA spokesperson told Fox News."Educators are leading conversations to encourage people to learn more about getting vaccinated in an effort to keep students, their families and our communities safe and healthy," they continued.A spokesperson for Made to Save said the nonprofit is "a non-political, non-partisan organization, whose focus is to increase equitable access to the vaccines and knowledge about them to communities of color, which have been hardest hit by the pandemic.""Made to Save relies on a careful vendor selection process that is informed by our campaign needs and the communities we serve," the spokesperson continued. "Our aim is to add capacity to and amplify the work of our on-the-ground partners across the country."The Made to Save spokesperson also told Fox News that the data "collected during our use of the REACH app will only be used for outreach efforts to follow up on conversations with individuals about the COVID-19 vaccines."MTPS did not respond to Fox News’ request for comment.Houston Keene is a reporter for Fox News Digital.

In 15 states, more than 10% of adults have permits. The highest concealed carry rate is inAlabamawhere 32.1% of adults have permits followed byIndianaand Iowa where the rate is 21.6% and 16.5% respectively.Additionally, the study found that permit holders tend to be law abiding."Permit holders are extremely law-abiding," the study says. "In Florida and Texas, permit holders are convicted of firearms related violations at one-twelfth of the rate at which police officers are convicted."NRA INSTRUCTOR TRAINS THOUSANDS OF INNER CITY WOMEN 'TO ENSURE THEY’RE NEVER VICTIMS'John R. Lott Jr, president of theCrime Prevention Research Center, told Fox News that increased crime and the defund the police movement have contributed to the rise in gun permits."The reason for the increase is the same as the increase in gun sales over the last two years, increased crime and concerns that police aren’t able to do their job and that large numbers of inmates released from jails and prisons," Lott said.Lott added that the increase would likely have been larger if not for coronavirus lockdowns that halted the or greatly reduced issuing permits in 20 states."These numbers are particularly topical given that the U.S. Supreme Court will hear the concealed carry case of New York State Rifle & Pistol Association V. Corlett in November," the study states.  "That case will determine whether those requesting permits need to provide a ‘proper cause’ for obtaining a permit. The eight states with that rule have issued permits to only 1.24% of their adult population."If the "proper cause" regulation were to be overturned, the study suggests that 2.3 million more permits could be issued in the affected states.20 GOP STATES PUSH BACK AGAINST BIDEN GUN REGULATIONSThe study also notes that women and minorities make up a significant percentage of the increase in gun permits."In 2021, women made up 28.3% of permit holders in the 14 states that provide data by gender, an increase from the 26.4% last year," the study says. "Seven states had data from 2012 to 2020/2021, and permit numbers grew 108.7% faster for women than for men."Additionally, three states that provide detailed race and gender data show "remarkably larger increases in permits for minorities compared to whites.""In Texas, black females saw a 6.3 times greater percentage increase in permits than white males from 2002 to 2020," according to the study. "Oklahoma data from 2002 to 2020 indicated that the increase of licenses approved for Asians and American Indians was more than twice the rate for whites. North Carolina had black permits increase twice as fast as whites from 1996 till 2016."CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThe study added, "From 2015 to 2020/2021, in the four states that provide data by race over that time period, the number of Asian people with permits increased 93.2% faster than the number of whites with permits.

Earlier this week, an Axios/Ipsos Coronavirus Index poll showed 53% of Americans say they have little or no trust in Biden when it comes to COVID.Psaki said she believes that the polls are "more a reflection of people being sick and tired of COVID."She said some people who are vaccinated are frustrated that others refuse to take the jab, and blamed "the rise of Delta" (the variant) for crimping the U.S.’s return to normal."Ultimately, and the president has said many times, the buck stops with him," she said. "The way to solve it is to continue to get more people vaccinated and get people’s lives returning back to normal."No global leader has been unscathed politically by the COVID-19 pandemic. There have been violent protests over lockdowns in countries like France and Denmark and some Trump supporters believe the former president would have carried 2020 had it not been for the virus.Axios reportedthat the poll points to "malaise more than fear" among Americans but "malaise could spell real trouble for a Democratic president who built his support on a pledge to steer the nation out of crisis — and whose party's bare House and Senate majorities are on the line in 2022."The report pointed out that in late January, 58% of Americans trusted the president with the virus.Cliff Young, the president of Ipsos U.S. public affairs, told the news outlet that Biden won on COVID and "surfed the first six months" on the virus.GET THE FOX NEWS APP"But he's being challenged by it now because there's not a clear resolution in sight," he said.Edmund DeMarche is a senior news editor for FoxNews.com.

Previously, distribution sites could order the antibody treatments directly from manufacturers.However, demand has soared amid the spread of the contagious delta variant, prompting the administration to initiate a change that forces states to go through the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to receive the treatments, and places caps on how many each state can receive.The Texas Department of State Health Services told Fox News it ordered about 4,700 treatment doses from GlaxoSmithKline.Floridaand Texas are two states that make up for a substantial part of the demand for the treatments. Last week, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Thursday that seven states made up roughly 70% of the requests.Texas Gov Greg Abbott, front center, is flanked by officials as he signs a bill that provides additional funding for security at the U.S.-Mexico border on Sept. 17.

Put the specifics acts (or lack thereof) in the memo," it reads, referring to apparent memos about members' beliefs.If members cite the use of fetal stem cells, the draft guidance suggests asking whether "they have ever taken Tylenol, Pepto Bismol, Aspirin, Ibuprofen,[ ]Benadryl, or Claritin, all of which were developed using fetal cells."PENTAGON RELEASES RELIGIOUS EXEMPTION GUIDELINES FOR BYPASSING MANDATORY VACCINEChaplain Religious Accommodation Questions[8][1]byFox Newson ScribdTable 1[3][1]byFox Newson ScribdIt adds: "Ask whether they are also going to be refraining from any of these medications and from all products whose development involved fetal cells at some point. Note response in memo."First Liberty Institute, a religious liberty organization that obtained the documents from chaplains who wish to remain anonymous, told Fox News on Tuesday that the guidance was unconstitutional."This guidance memo is one of the worst constitutional violations I’ve ever seen, and we’ve seen some doozies at First Liberty," said Mike Berry, a marine reservist who also serves as general counsel at First Liberty. "This nothing less than a modern-day Inquisition. It demonstrates that the USCG’s real motivation is religious hostility."TUCKER CARLSON: THE MILITARY'S COVID VACCINE MANDATE AMOUNTS TO A POWER GRABThe guidance also encourages references to a supplemental table containing pro-vaccine statements from various faith leaders.When asked about the documents, the USCG said it would provide reasonable accommodations if doing so wouldn't impact military readiness, as well as other factors."In accordance with the Religious Freedom Restoration Act … and the Coast Guard’s religious accommodation policy (COMDTINST 1000.15), the Coast Guard provides reasonable accommodations to the observances of the religious faith practiced by individual members when these doctrines or observances will not have an adverse impact on military readiness, individual or unit readiness, unit cohesion, health, safety, discipline, or mission accomplishment," said Lieutenant Commander Brittany Panetta."Requests for a religious accommodation are granted or denied on a case-by-case basis and will be informed by input from the member’s command, medical, judge advocate, and military chaplain. The link to the official Coast Guard process and policy for religious accommodation can be foundhere" (link provided by USCG).ARMY OFFICER RESIGNS OVER BIDEN VACCINE MANDATE, ‘MARXIST TAKEOVER OF THE MILITARY’The documents touched on a raging debate over whether religious Americans should be able to exempt themselves from the vaccine. The USCG's supplemental table references approving statements from the Vatican Congregation on the Doctrine of Faith and the National Association of Evangelicals.Perhaps the most well-known debate has occurred within the Catholic Church, whose members have expressed concerns about the various vaccines' ties to aborted fetal cell lines.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThe USCCBpreviously saidCatholics could receive Moderna's and Pfizer's vaccines, noting that use of the products was "very remote from the initial evil of the abortion."Some Catholics, like Bishop Joseph Strickland, have expressed concerns about the ties to an aborted fetal cell line.

HHS must investigate and hold New Hampshire accountable for its blatantly illegal discrimination," EPPC policy analyst Rachel Morrison said in a press release.The complaint focuses on a 28-year-old White male, whose name was redacted from the version of the complaint released to the public. According to the complaint, the anonymous man was at heightened risk for the COVID-19 virus but was notified via an automatic recording that appointments were "fully subscribed" for people of color."On April 2, 2021, he called the Public Health Council of the Upper Valley to request a COVID-19 vaccination appointment. He was told through a recorded message that appointments were ‘fully subscribed for people of color,’" the complaint reads.That allegedly came after the state of New Hampshire prioritized minorities as part of an effort to aid "disproportionately impacted populations."NYC CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER CALLS FOR RACIAL PREFERENCES IN MEDICAL CARE, CRITICIZES 'COLORBLIND' PRACTICESOn Tuesday, Gov. Sununu's office told Fox News: "New Hampshire has been one of the most successful states in the nation at vaccine roll-out, and early on in the crisis was the fastest state in the nation for getting shots in arms quickly. NH opened the vaccine to everyone on April 2, before nearly every other state. Everyone who wanted a vaccine could have gotten a vaccine, and this complaint is going nowhere."The complaint demands HHS cease funding of both the state and the public health council until it receives written assurances that they won’t discriminate on the basis of race.It reads: "Although it is unclear if the state continues to discriminate on the basis of race, color, or national origin, at least as late as June 27, 2021, the state's main COVID vaccine website continued to state that ‘appointments are limited’ and 'dependent on [vaccine] supply,' which left open the door to state discriminating against whites."The governor’s office, state department of health and Public Health Council of the Upper Valley did not immediately respond to Fox News’ request for comment.According toValley News, the Public Health Council of Upper Valley touted its focus on people who identified as non-White."We are thrilled that the Upper Valley Public Health Region was able to provide this opportunity to so many of our neighbors who identify as Black, Indigenous or a person of color," said executive director Alice Ely.Gov. Sununu reportedly touted the statewide policy as a way to ensure "equity."CORONAVIRUS IN THE US: STATE-BY-STATE BREAKDOWN"We have a plan in terms of allocating a certain amount of our vaccine to ensure equity," he said, according toInsideSources.com. "A plan to reach our communities that tend to be inequitably served by our healthcare system."Elizabeth R. Daly, who heads the Bureau of Infectious Disease Control at the state Department of Health and Human Services, similarly said: "We have a commitment of equitable allocation of the vaccine."CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPDaly added: "And part of that plan involves meeting the needs of those people who've been disproportionally impacted by COVID-19. This includes people who are in racial and ethnic minority groups."This wasn’t the first time a state attempted to prioritize racial minorities over White residents.

Biden said first lady Jill Biden plans to get a booster shot as well.When asked how many Americans would need to be vaccinated for the country to get back to "normal," the president said his mandates help."I think we get the vast majority by just going on with some industries and some schools, 97-98%," Biden said, seemingly referring to his executive order, signed earlier this month, requiring all federal workers in the executive branch to be vaccinated, as well as another that mandated all private companies with more than 100 employees to require vaccinations."I think we're getting awful close but I'm not the scientist," Biden added."But one thing is for sure: A quarter of the country cannot go unvaccinated and us not have a problem," Biden said.CDC DIRECTOR RECOMMENDS BOOSTER SHOT FOR YOUNGER FRONTLINE WORKERS, DEFYING ADVISORY PANELIndividuals eligible for the third dose of the Pfizer vaccine are those who are 65 years old or older, adults 18 or older with underlying health conditions, and those who are at increased risk of COVID-19, like health care workers, teachers, grocery store workers and others on the front line.Biden, on Friday, said that if an individual received their second dose of Pfizer in January, February or March, they are now eligible to receive a third. At this point, about 60 million Americans fall under the eligible group for the booster.The president, in recent days, has been urging unvaccinated Americans to "do the right thing," and get a shot to protect themselves againstCOVID-19.The president, from the White House, said some Americans' refusals to get vaccinated "has cost all of us."Biden touted the "incredible progress" of vaccinations, with more than 182 million Americans fully vaccinated with Pfizer, Moderna or one shot of Johnson & Johnson.But Biden stressed that this pandemic "is a pandemic of the unvaccinated."He went on, "Their refusal has cost all of us. The refusal to get vaccinated has cost all of us," adding that he intended to move forward in mandating vaccinations wherever he can.Brooke Singman is a Fox News Digital politics reporter.

Sarah Klein of the University of Rochester Medical Center with reaction.A leader of the Greater New York chapter of the Black Lives Matter movement is chastising New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio over aCOVID-19vaccine mandate and vaccine passport process for residents, equating it to "modern day freedom papers."Chivona Newsome, a co-founder of Black Lives Matter Greater NY who also ran as a candidate forNew York’s 15th Congressional District in 2020, spoke out against the "racist" mandate in a statement to Fox News."Although Mayor Bill De Blasio ran on progressives values, nothing in his tenure will attest to his campaign promises," Newsome said. "The September 13th vaccine mandate is racist and specifically targets Black New Yorkers. The vaccination passports are modern day Freedom Papers, which limit the free will of Black people."NY GOVERNOR REFUSING TO BUDGE ON VACCINE MANDATE FOR NURSES: YOU'RE REPLACEABLENewsome also accused De Blasio of failing "to protect New York’s most vulnerable" throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, adding that the "social distancing and mask requirements resulted in Black New Yorkers being brutalized and arrested while their White neighbors received masks and refreshments.""The vaccination mandates infringe upon the civil liberties of the Black community," Newsome claimed. "It’s more than where we can dine or enjoy entertainment, it will result in loss of income. As of Monday, September 27, Black health care workers and educators will lose their jobs."According to Newsome, De Blasio was "fully aware of the hesitancy and distrust people of African descent have about vaccination and their interactions with government and law enforcement," yet he still "chose to disenfranchise and force the very people who elected him into poverty and second-class citizenship."Newsome vowed to prevent the vaccine mandate from being used as "a free pass to racism" and said that Black Lives Matter Greater NY plans to "demonstrate" until the vaccine mandate is "abolished."CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP"It is the duty of Black Lives Matter Greater NY to fight for the liberty of Black people," Newsome told Fox News. "The vaccination passport will not be a free pass to racism. Our organization pledges to demonstrate until the vaccine mandate is abolished."The mandate,announcedby de Blasio in early August, requires that both workers and customers of certain categories of businesses like restaurants, gyms and movie theaters provide proof that they have been vaccinated against the coronavirus in order to enter.But since the rule went into effect, there have been reports of disputes at several establishments, which have also been burdened with manning the front lines of its enforcement.Such a dispute was the reason BLM Greater NY held a demonstration on Monday in front of Carmine's Italian Restaurant, where protesters demanded justice for the Black women who were purportedly denied entry.Kyle Morris covers politics for Fox News.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.TheBidenadministration's summer was plagued by multiple crises: FromAfghanistan, torising prices, to a record setting influx of migrants at the border.Even legacy media outlets, known for their mostly favorable coverage of President Biden, couldn't avoid covering the constant trickle of bad news from overseas and at home. Democrats – spurred by the deaths of 13 US service members in Afghanistan – even began hammering the president.And as Republicans raked Biden over the coals for having "blood on his hands" in Afghanistan and leaving Americans stranded, President Biden needed to shift the national discussion away from his botched withdrawal."This is not about freedom or personal choice,"Biden said in an address to the nationabout his COVID vaccine mandate this month. "It's about protecting yourself and those around you, the people you work with, the people you care about, the people you love. My job as president is to protect all Americans."BIDEN VACATIONS AT DELAWARE BEACH HOUSE AFTER WEEK OF HEAVY LOSSESThe announcement set off a media frenzy, as up to 100 million workers could be affected by the mandate. Headlines began focusing on how companies and organizationswould workto follow the mandate, and how announcements from some organizations sayingthey would not comply.Republican lawmakers declared the mandate "unconstitutional," and healthcare and government employees took to thestreets to protest.Critics have since sounded off that the mandate was a distraction, withSen. Ted Cruz arguingthat the administration wanted to change the national discourse from Afghanistan and subsequently "issued this completely illegal and unconstitutional vaccine mandate."But Biden's woes didn't end with the withdrawal from Afghanistan.The border crisis soon reemerged when14,000 migrants huddled under a bridgein Del Rio, Texas last week; the Pentagonadmitted a drone strike killed 10 civiliansin Afghanistan and not ISIS terrorists; France pulled its ambassador to the U.S. from Washington, D.C; news broke that the nation's top-ranking military officer, Gen. Mark Milley, reportedly gave assurances toChina that America would not strikethe country during the Trump administration; and there's beenconfusion over Biden’s coronavirus boostercampaign.Just days after news of the Del Rio border crisis and the botched drone strike dominated headlines, the Biden administration announced new COVID travelrequirements Mondayfor foreign nationals entering the U.S., ordering them to be vaccinated before coming to the country.The move nearly backfired when Fox News's Peter Doocy questionedWhite House press secretary Jen Psakiif proof of vaccination or negative COVID test will be required for migrants at the border as images of the Del Rio encampment became hard to ignore.And as outrage mounted over the claim that Border Patrol agents were usingwhips on Haitian migrants, CDC DirectorRochelle Walenskyoverruled an agency advisory committee on Friday, saying the COVID booster shot will also be available tohealthcare workers and otherswith high exposure to the virus, after an FDA panel rejected distribution of the booster shots to the general public last week.The move put her on defense, and she told the media her agency is "absolutely following the science" afterconcerns that Biden's administrationwas backtracking on the vow to listen to health experts during the pandemic.CDC'S COVID BOOSTER SHOT REVERSAL: IS THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION FOLLOWING THE SCIENCE?As the various troubles mounted for Biden, critics escalated criticism that his administration is distracting away from negative press.Sen. Josh Hawley sounded off after reporters were denied questions in the Oval Office during Biden's meeting with UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, slamming Congressional Democrats for "defending" Biden's "evasion, distraction, and outright lies."And even when the news cycle intensified last week with more losses for the administration, Biden had a long weekend on a Delaware beach, whichcritics latchedonto as evidence of having anabsent president.But Biden has stayed on message about vaccines, and told the nation on Friday he will receive the booster shot and also directed focus on admonishing the "over 70 million Americans who have failed to get a single shot."CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP"There are elected officials actively working to undermine with false information the fight against Covid-19.

ABBOTT CREATES ‘STEEL BARRIER’ OF VEHICLES TO BLOCK MIGRANTS FROM ENTERING US9.21 Arizona AG letter to Becerra on COVIDbyFox Newson ScribdMeanwhile, it cites former and current border officials who say that the agency has been hit with a surge in agents testing positive for COVID-19 as well as the escalating number of migrant apprehensions at the southwest border – which have been over 200,000 in both July and August.The Republican attorney general, who has pushed back against President Biden’s vaccine mandate, accuses the administration of choosing to increase regulation and shrink liberties when it comes to battling COVID-19."Yet this same administration has been nothing short of laissez-faire in dealing with tens of thousands of migrants that are pouring across our open border and being ferried across our nation during the same world-wide pandemic," he says. "This hypocrisy is stunning and fundamentally unfair to American citizens."Brnovich asks Becerra what HHS is doing to ensure migrants "will not come into contact with Americans while they are infected or exposed to COVID-19.While the Biden administration has said that unaccompanied children are tested at HHS facilities when they are transferred into custody, there has been concerns about the release of migrant family units without COVID testing.

So it's really disappointing to see that."Teachers unions have previously influenced changes to the CDC’s school-related guidance, reports have shown.COVID-19 VACCINE AND TESTING MANDATE GETS SUPPORT FROM LARGEST US TEACHERS UNIONCDC spokeswoman Jade Fulce told Fox News that guidance is "always being revised based on the current epidemiology" and that increases in the delta variant and low vaccination coverage in some communities led to the changes.But the CDC’s previous guidance only suggested transitioning out ofCOVID-19precautions, including masking students, as cases decreased. So mitigation efforts would remain in the case of a surge or a high infection rate.The language in the agency’s "Guidance for Covid-19 Prevention in K-12 Schools," intended to help school administrators and local health officials transition from prevention strategies as cases moved to lower levels, was removed after Aug. 4, acached versionof the webpage shows.A note on the guidance states that it was updated to recommend indoor masking for everyone, but doesn't mention that any language was removed.The CDC guidance on Aug. 4 indicated that it was intended to help school administrators and local health officials determine which prevention strategies to use and how to transition "out of COVID-19 pandemic precautions as community transmission of COVID-19 reaches low levels or stops."That portion of the guidance is now gone.Initially, the CDC's guidance included metrics that could help schools decide which mitigation strategies to use. But those metrics were removed.The guidance instead states that schools should determine what "additional" strategies should be used as they monitor transmission levels.The CDC’s guidance on Aug. 4 recommended that schools continue masking and distancing, but noted that they if they decide to scale back any prevention strategies, "they should remove them one at a time and monitor closely."That language was removed entirely.The CDC had also recommended that school masking policies do not conflict with any state laws or regulations. This portion no longer appears on the site."They removed all off-ramps," Zachreson, who leads the group Reopen California Schools, told Fox News. "So other mitigations, removing masking – even if COVID prevalence goes down to zero or vaccination rates increase – the CDC guidelines do not recommend removing these protocols for schools like they previously did.""I know that goes against what many infectious disease experts are telling us, especially here in California," Zachreson continued. "This also comes as there was a conflict with … our state's health department's recommendations on masking."Zachreson's comments follow reports showingteachersunions influencing the CDC on its earlier school guidance.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPIn May, theNew York Postreported on emails the watchdog group Americans for Public Trust had received showing coordination between the BidenWhite Houseand teachers unions on school reopenings.The Post's report showed that in at least two instances, suggestions that the American Federation of Teachers offered were "adopted nearly verbatim" in the final text of a CDC document on reopening guidance released in February.Earlier in September,Fox Newsreported on emails obtained by Americans for Public Trust showing that the CDC tightened its masking guidelines in May after receiving threats from a teachers union.Get all the stories you need-to-know from the most powerful name in news delivered first thing every morning to your inboxSubscribedYou've successfully subscribed to this newsletter!This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2022 FOX News Network, LLC.

Milley's alleged phone calls and China's growing aggression.Sen.Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said Sunday thatPresident Biden’svaccinemandate for private businesses is designed to fail and being used only as a distraction from his "catastrophe" inAfghanistan.During an appearance on Fox News’"Sunday Morning Futures,"Cruz said Biden’s rule requiring companies with 100 or more employees to mandate theCOVID-19vaccine or weekly testing is "illegal" and only meant to get the Democratic president back in the media’s good graces after he was widely criticized for his chaotic military withdrawal in Afghanistan.TIMES SQUARE SWARMED BY HUNDREDS PROTESTING COVID VACCINE MANDATE, CHANTING 'F--- JOE BIDEN'"They want to change the topic from Afghanistan," the senator said. "It’s why Biden issued this completely illegal and unconstitutional vaccine mandate, because he wanted to change the topic from the disaster in Afghanistan."The vaccine mandate is going to be struck down in court. They know that," he continued. "But the president is defying the law because he wanted the press to start defending him and stop talking about the disasters in Afghanistan. And he’s counting on a bunch of big businesses, in particular, forcing their employees to comply before the matter is ever adjudicated and before the order is struck down."Cruz went on to argue that every policy decision by Biden, foreign and domestic, has been driven by "pure politics.""When it comes to Afghanistan, Joe Biden and his administration presided over the worst foreign policy catastrophe in a generation," he said. "They put politics in front of everything else. They abandoned Americans behind enemy lines, and it was a disaster. We were routed there, because Joe Biden surrendered."He fled and left hundreds if not thousands of Americans in harm’s way and we are going to be paying the price – our nation is going to pay the price for our president’s weakness and incompetence for years to come," he added.Cruz also said the world is less safe because of Biden’s actions in Afghanistan, arguing that America’s adversaries have taken note of the president’s weakness and will not hesitate to take advantage of it, citing China as an example."Unfortunately, I believe the chances of a Chinese amphibious assault on Taiwan have increased tenfold in the last month," Cruz said. "If that happens it would be utterly disastrous, but weakness invites aggression."CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP"When you have a president who rolls over for everything, it only invites the bad guys to do worse and worse things," he said.Ten Chinese aircraft entered Taiwan’s air defense zone on Friday, the day after the democratically governed island announced a $9 billion boost to military spending to counter the threat from mainland China, which considers Taiwan as part of its territory.Jessica Chasmar is a reporter for Fox News Digital.

Ron DeSantis takes aim at President Biden over vaccine mandates and Afghanistan withdrawal while speaking at a political event in Nebraska City, NebraskaFlorida Gov.RonDeSantishammered theBidenadministration for overhauling the distribution of monoclonal antibodies in a way that will severely hamper the treatment's availability in several Republican-controlled states.The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) alarmed authorities in several southern, red states – where the antibodies are widely used – after announcing Monday that the agency would be changing how theCOVID-19treatment is distributed.Previously, distribution sites could order the antibody treatments directly from the supplier. Now, the federal government will decide how many doses each state will receive and leave it to state governments to ration it out among locations.DeSantis warned that HHS' new equitable distribution plan for monoclonal antibodies (MAB) is "very, very problematic" and warned patients "are going to suffer as a result of this."ASSOCIATED PRESS RIPPED AFTER FAUCI TOUTS MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES: ‘ISN’T THIS THE THING RON DESANTIS PROMOTED?’"We were happy to see that Biden’s COVID plan announced last week included a 50% increase in monoclonal antibody deliveries to states this month," DeSantis press secretary Christina Pushaw told Fox News in a Thursday statement."So it's surprising and deeply disappointing that the Biden Admin would break this promise just a week later and cut MAB allocation to Florida, so they aren’t even providing half of the doses of life-saving treatment that COVID patients in Florida will need," Pushaw continued.The governor’s spokeswoman added that DeSantis "is committed to ensuring that everyone who needs the treatment" is able to be treated, "even if we can't count on the Biden administration."HHS didn't return Fox News' emailed questions for this article.Florida is one of seven states, alongside Texas and Alabama, making up the majority of demand for the treatment. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Thursday the seven states made up roughly 70% of the requests.DeSantis on Thursday argued that it shouldn't be surprising that the states currently experiencing a seasonal surge are the ones needing the most doses of the treatment.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThe Alabama Medical Association voiced alarm about the HHS changes after Monday's announcement."Alabama's hospitals are full and under tremendous stress. That's why physicians are very concerned about federal efforts that will end up limiting our supply and access to this effective treatment," Dr. Aruna Arora, the association's president, said in a statement Monday."We're calling on the federal government to help us provide more of this treatment – not less – so we can save lives and keep COVID patients out of the hospital."Houston Keene is a reporter for Fox News Digital.

We acknowledge the difficulty balancing protective measures with the primary mission of securing the border. However, DHS must be prepared to meet the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic," according tothe report.MIGRANT NUMBERS UNDER TEXAS BRIDGE DOUBLE TO 8,000+ IN 24 HOURS: 'OUT OF CONTROL'The report also asserts that U.S. Customs and Border Patrol (CBP), which falls under DHS, "is not able to maintain proper physical distancing in holding facilities due to the current number of migrants illegally entering the United States."Another problem is that mask protocols that are not being followed by migrants. The report states, "Migrants are constantly reminded of COVID-19 risk but choose not to social distance or wear provided masks."Over 8,000 migrants gathered under a bridge in Del Rio, Texas, after crossing the border illegally."Additionally, during one interview with a CBP supervisory Border Patrol agent from a southwest border processing center, the agent raised specific concerns regarding the health and safety of the CBP staff and migrants. The agent stated that because CBP does not have a COVID-19 testing policy, UCs (unaccompanied child) are held in pods in close proximity with other potentially positive UCs. Moreover, in some instances due to HHS being at capacity, UCs were in CBP custody for more than 20 days without being tested for COVID-19."The report concludes that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) stresses the importance of testing, isolating and contact tracing measures to control the spread of COVID-19."DHS leadership must commit to strengthening these COVID-19 preventative measures," says the IG, which is also recommending DHS "reassess its COVID-19 response framework to identify areas for improvement to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 while balancing its primary mission of securing the border."DRONE FOOTAGE SHOWS THOUSANDS OF MIGRANTS UNDER BRIDGE IN DEL RIO, TEXAS AS LOCAL FACILITIES OVERWHELMEDEven thoughabout 30% of immigrantsheld at federal detention facilities are refusing to be vaccinated, the Biden administration is not mandating the vaccine for migrants who cross the border. In contrast, Biden announced last week that American employers with over 100 employees will be required to mandate the vaccine for workers, or face a hefty fine.The IG report also comes after the CBPannounced Wednesdaythat there were 208,887 encounters in August. Although it is a slight dip from July, it represents a 317% increase over August 2020 numbers. Of those encounters, 44% resulted in an expulsion under Title 42 public health protections, but just 19% of the more than 86,000 family unit encounters ended in a Title 42 expulsion.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPFox News has also obtained drone footage of thousands of migrants under the International Bridge in Del Rio, Texas just this week. Border Patrol and law enforcement sources told Fox News that over 4,200 migrants were waiting to be apprehended under the bridge after crossing into the United States on Wednesday.That number under the bridge doubled to over 8,200 in just 24 hours, according to sources.Fox News' Adam Shaw and Bill Melugin contributed to this report.Get all the stories you need-to-know from the most powerful name in news delivered first thing every morning to your inboxSubscribedYou've successfully subscribed to this newsletter!This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2022 FOX News Network, LLC.

"But convincing those who are hesitant to do so would require you to allow room for discussion and disagreement."BIDEN'S SIX-PRONG COVID-19 PLAN INCLUDES VACCINE AND MASK MANDATES: PREVIEW OF THURSDAY SPEECH"Instead, you have offered the American people flimsy legal arguments, contradictory statements, and threatening directives. It is almost as if your goal is to sow division and distrust, rather than promote unity and the public’s health."A health worker administers a dose of a Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine during a vaccination clinic at the Grand Yesha Ballroom in Philadelphia.  (AP Photo/Matt Rourke, File)In the letter, they call the mandate "disastrous and counterproductive," saying that the rule "will simply drive further skepticism" about the vaccine and prompt "at least some Americans" to "leave the job market instead of complying."Republican Attorneys General Association (RAGA) Chairman South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson said in a press release announcing the multistate letter, "We will not tolerate Biden's tyrannical rule. The lines are clear, this is Joe Biden's unlawful agenda versus the American people. We will win this fight and protect the foundational principles that make our country great."The AGs pledge to "seek every available legal option to hold [Biden] accountable and uphold the rule of law."COVID-19 KILLS AMERICANS AT A RATE OF 1 IN 500, DATA SHOWSThe AGs argue that employees who leave their jobs as a result of the requirement will put added strain on "an already-too-tight labor market, burdening companies and (therefore) threatening the jobs of even those who have received a vaccine.""Worse still, many of those who decide to leave their jobs rather than follow your directive will be essential healthcare workers," they write, citing aNew York Times reportabout an upstate New York hospital that decided to stop delivering babies after six labor and delivery nurses resigned over the state's vaccine mandate.Hospitals across the country are simultaneously facingstaffing shortagesandfull ICU capacitydue to increasing COVID-19 cases, leaving staffoverwhelmed.The attorneys general also argue that Biden's mandate will add to vaccine skepticism, saying the order "suggests that the vaccinated need protection from those who, for whatever personal reason, choose not to or cannot receive a COVID-19 shot" and "fails to recognize natural immunity."A healthcare worker strokes the forehead of a COVID-19 patient in a field hospital set up inside the Citibanamex convention center in Mexico City, on the first year anniversary that the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus a pandemic. (AP Photo/Fernando Llano, File)There are currently more than 90,000 people hospitalized with the virus across the country, and there are 1,262 new COVID-19 deaths being reported every day over the last seven days — a 10% increase compared to the last calendar week.The Republicans conclude that "broadly mandating vaccinations (or weekly COVID-19 testing) for 80 million Americans, simply because they work at a business of a certain size, hardly seems ‘necessary' to meet any such danger," adding that there are other ways to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 besides requiring vaccines for businesses of a certain size.CAN KIDS GET ‘LONG COVID’ AFTER CORONAVIRUS INFECTIONS?The attorneys general of states with the lowest vaccination rates including West Virginia, Wyoming, Idaho, Alabama and Mississippi all signed the letter.More than half of the entire U.S. population have received both vaccine doses, while more than 60% have received at least the first dose.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPIn June, 99.5% of all COVID-19 deaths were of unvaccinated people.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has noted that no COVID-19 vaccine is 100% effective against the virus.The CDC has also reported two serious yet rare side effects of the vaccine, anaphylaxis, which can be treated immediately, and thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS), which occurred in seven out of 1 million women under 50 who received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.Audrey Conklin is a digital reporter for FOX Business and Fox News.

In his most forceful comments to date, the president last week announced new, wide-ranging, federal COVID vaccine requirements for those working at companies with 100 or more employees, health care workers and federal contractors.BIDEN APPROVAL RATING KEEPS SLIPPING IN WAKE OF AFGHANISTAN EXIT, COVID SURGEForty-eight percent of those surveyed said Biden’s vaccine mandates go too far, with 10% saying they doesn’t go far enough and nearly four in 10 saying they're about right.

(Samuel Corum/Bloomberg via Getty Images)Biden, in a White House speech last Thursday, took aim at the tens of millions of Americans who have yet to get vaccinated, even after months of availability and federal, state and local incentives to get the shots."We’ve been patient. But our patience is wearing thin, and your refusal has cost all of us," he said. And he stressed that the minority of Americans who are unvaccinated "can cause a lot of damage, and they are."CLICK HERE FOR THE LATEST FOX NEWS REPORTING ON THE COVID CRISISStudies indicate that the delta variant’s infection rate among those who are vaccinated is significantly lower than in people who have resisted taking the vaccine.But the president’s actions sparked a quick reaction from Republican leaders across the country – as well as some union leaders – charging that Biden was going too far in trying to force private companies and their workers to take the vaccines.An increasing number of mask mandates have been reinstated in certain areas across the country in the wake of the COVID case surge. According to the poll, Americans by a nearly two-to-one margin support requiring students, teachers and school staff to wear masks. And a majority (57%) support requiring masks while in indoor public spaces.By a 68%-24% margin, those polled said that the rise in COVID deaths this summer was preventable.CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC: STATE-BY-STATE BREAKDOWN"’It didn’t have to be this bad,’ say voters. The nearly three to one margin of Americans who feel the country should have by now turned the corner on COVID underscores deep, lingering concern over the still menacing virus," Quinnipiac University polling analyst Tim Malloy said.A separate national poll byMonmouth University, which was also released Wednesday, indicated that 63% of Americans support COVID vaccine mandates for health workers, with 58% supporting such mandates for federal employees, and 55% backing such requirements for private contractors working for the federal government.According to the survey, 63% support the instituting or reinstituting of state-based face mask and social distancing guidelines, up from 52% in July."The current poll shows majorities of residents in both red states and blue states support some type of Covid control measures, and that includes many of the mandates proposed by the president last week," Monmouth University Polling Institute Director Patrick Murray highlighted.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThe Monmouth University Poll was conducted Sept. 9-13, with 802 adults nationwide questioned.

Bill Haggerty, R-Tenn., on Secretary of State Antony Blinken getting grilled on the Afghanistan withdrawal during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing.President Biden’s standing among Americans continues to slide, according to new national poll released on Tuesday.Facing a barrage of bipartisan criticism for a month over his handling of the turbulent U.S. withdrawal and evacuation fromAfghanistan, and with an ongoing surge in newCOVID casesdue to the spread across the country this summer of the highly infectious delta variant, the president’s approval rating stands at 42% and his disapproval at 50% in aQuinnipiac University surveyconducted Sept. 10-13.That’s a significant drop from Quinnipiac’s previous national survey in early August, when the president stood at 46% approval 43% disapproval. And it’s the first time Biden’s job approval rating has dropped into negative territory in Quinnipiac polling since the start of his presidency in January.CLICK HERE FOR THE LATEST FOX NEWS REPORTING ON THE AFGHANISTAN EXITThe president’s approval rating hovered in the low to mid 50s during his first six months in the White House. But Biden’s numbers started sliding last month, as the crisis in Afghanistan dominated media coverage and mask mandates started returning in certain spots across the country as coronavirus cases rose.The president stands at 45%-50% approval/disapproval in an average of the latest surveys compiled by RealClearPolitics, and at 46%-49% in a compilation by the polling and analysis website FiveThirtyEight."If there ever was a honeymoon for President Biden, it is clearly over. This is, with few exceptions, a poll full of troubling negatives… from overall job approval, to foreign policy, to the economy," Quinnipiac University polling analyst Tim Malloy highlighted.DEMOCRATIC SENATOR TAKES AIM AT BIDEN WHITE HOUSE OVER FAILURE TO FORECAST TALIBAN TAKEOVER OF AFGHANISTANNearly seven in ten questioned in the poll said it was the right thing to do to end the war in Afghanistan, and a majority (54%-41%) said they approve of Biden’s decision to withdraw all U.S. troops from the war torn Central Asian nation – ending America’s longest war. But by a 65%-31% margin, Americans said they disapprove of how the president handled the rocky withdrawal and evacuation of U.S. personnel and Afghan allies.Biden has been pilloried for his handling of the hastily organized evacuation efforts in Afghanistan. While the president has repeatedly declared the withdrawal and evacuation a success – the U.S. airlifted roughly 120,000 people, including more than 5,500 Americans, after the fall of Kabul to repressive Taliban forces in early August through the end of last month - he’s been accused byRepublicansand someDemocratsfor underestimating the Taliban’s lightning fast takeover of the country and overestimating the strength of the now-collapsed, U.S.-backed Afghan government and military.The president’s approval on handling foreign policy now stands at 34%-59%, and his handling of his duties as Commander in Chief of the U.S. military is also underwater, at 40%-55%.WITH BIDEN'S POLL NUMBERS DROPPING, DEMOCRATS WORRY AFGHANISTAN EXIT MAY IMPACT 2022 MIDTERMSBiden showcased his foreign policy prowess and his competence in running an administration as he challenged formerPresident Trumpin the 2020 election. And while the rocky exit from Afghanistan is a major factor in the president’s approval rating plunge, it’s not the only issue that's feeding the fall.One of the issues that vaulted Biden to the presidency was the coronavirus, the worst pandemic to sweep the globe in a century. Biden vowed to do what Trump seemingly couldn’t do – get COVID cases under control, bring back a sense of normalcy to Americans and boost an economy that was severely battered by the pandemic.But the late-summer COVID surge due to the Delta variant is another blow to the president. Biden’s approval on handling the COVID crisis now stands at 48%, with disapproval at 49%. Biden’s approval on the issue in Quinnipiac polling stood at 65%-30% in May and 53%-40% at the beginning of last month.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPOn another key issue – the economy – Biden stands at a negative 42%-52%, down from 43%-48% in early August and a positive 48%-43% in May.Quinnipiac University surveyed 1,210 adults nationwide in their poll.

Terry McAuliffe, who is running to win back his seat in November, was seen maskless on anAmtraktrain from New York to Washington, D.C., in late July – skirting federal mask mandates and Amtrak rules.Fox News obtained photos of McAuliffe on a train from New York City's Moynihan Train Hall at Penn Station on the night of July 29. An Amtrak passenger, who spoke to Fox News on condition of anonymity, took the photos, calling McAuliffe's violation of the rules an "absolute double standard."The photo shows McAuliffe walking down the aisle of an Amtrak train, on a phone call, and not wearing a face covering. McAuliffe is seen standing under Amtrak's sign stating face masks are required. The relatively empty train car does show a passenger in the distance wearing a mask, and the passenger behind McAuliffe with a white strap over his ear, signaling that he, too, was wearing a mask.Democratic candidate for Virginia governor, former Gov. Terry McAuliffe, seen on Amtrak train without mask."Amtrak requires everyone to wear a face mask," the sign reads. "Face masks must fully cover the mouth and nose and secure under the chin. Face masks must always be worn unless actively eating or drinking."Amtrak’s website also states: "Federal law requires all customers and employees to wear a mask at all times while onboard trains and in stations, regardless of vaccination status or state or local laws."Amtrak requires all passengers to wear face coverings and masks throughout entirety of trip, per federal mandate."Refusing to wear a mask is a violation of federal law; passengers may be subject to penalties under federal law, denied boarding, removed from the train, and banned from future travel in the event of noncompliance,"Amtrakstates.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issuedan orderin January that required face masks to be worn by all people while on public transportation. That order also required all individuals to wear masks while at transportation hubs, including airports, bus or ferry terminals, train and subway stations, and other locations where people board public transportation in the United States.The passenger who shared the photos with Fox News said they were waiting to board the train when they recognized McAuliffe across the station taking a phone call.McAuliffe seen in New York Penn Station's Moynihan Train Hall without a face mask. Federal mask mandates require face coverings on public transportation and in all public transportation hubs including airports and train stations."My brain didn’t really move right away, but all of a sudden, I thought, that guy looks familiar," the passenger said, adding that they "took a picture of him there while we were in line."The passenger said a staffer for McAuliffe was waiting in line to board the train for him, while he took a phone call in the distance. When it was time to board the train, the passenger said the McAuliffe staffer waved him over to the line.The passenger said McAuliffe was "not wearing a mask on the escalator down to the platform," saying he continued his phone call."We happened to be in the same train car, and I took the second photo. We took our seats, and I didn’t get up for the rest of the trip, so I can’t speak to what he did or did not do during the trip as far as wearing a mask."The passenger added that when the train arrived to Union Station in Washington, D.C., McAuliffe was still not wearing a mask. The passenger, though, said they could not get a photo of him."I remember thinking I should say something to him, but didn’t want to start some incident or viral issue," the passenger said."I’m vaccinated, but Amtrak says put a mask on, so I put a mask on," the passenger said. "And when I looked around, he kind of highlighted himself because everyone else was wearing a mask."FLASHBACK: PHOTOS EMERGE OF NEWSOM INSIDE POSH RESTAURANT AMID CORONAVIRUS SPIKESHe added: "You have an individual who wants to be a leader of a state here in the United States, and it is an absolute double standard. You have to lead by example."The passenger went on to say that Americans "are tired of being told to do something by our leaders, and they don’t follow it themselves.""Whether you agree with it or not, it is easy enough to throw a mask on for a little while," the passenger said. "It seems to be a constant – whether you’re the governor of California or a member of Congress, or someone running for governor of Virginia."The passenger was referring to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who was seen last year at ahair salonin San Francisco, without a mask, despite local ordinances keeping salons closed; and California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who was seendining indoorswithout a mask last year, despite local COVID-19 guidelines. Newsom is facing a recall election Tuesday, as Californians attempt to unseat him over his handling of the COVID pandemic.FLASHBACK: PELOSI USED SHUTTERED HAIR SALON FOR BLOW OUT, OWNER CALLS IT ‘SLAP IN THE FACE’The passenger added: "There is no accountability with politicians these days and it frustrates people."The McAuliffe campaign did not comment on the photos of the candidate, but slammed his Republican opponent, Glenn Youngkin, saying that he has "an extensive history" of not following CDC mask guidance."Glenn Youngkin has shown Virginians he will be a failure when it comes to controlling this pandemic and rebuilding Virginia’s economy," McAuliffe spokesman Renzo Olivari told Fox News. "Glenn has an extensive history of not following CDC mask guidelines dating back to the worst periods of the COVID-19 pandemic, and he peddles such dangerous anti-vaxx and anti-mask rhetoric that doctors in Virginia have begged him to stop undermining measures that will prevent the spread of this virus."Olivari added: "Terry is the only candidate in this race who has a plan to get Virginians vaccinated, keep our kids in schools, and create a better future for all Virginians."McAuliffe, in anop-edpublished in the Washington Post in August about defeating the novel coronavirus, wrote that he "will always lead by example," and added that "taking this virus seriously is not a partisan issue it's a leadership test."McAuliffe has repeatedly posted on Twitter, reminding individuals to wear masks to protect against COVID-19 and to follow CDC guidance.As for Youngkin, he has attended some events without wearing masks or face coverings. There is no Virginia law requiring masks, butVirginiacurrently says individuals should wear a mask in public indoor settings in areas of substantial and high transmission of COVID-19.Virginia Beach currently is an area of high transmission.Virginia follows the federal order for both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, saying individuals "must wear a mask when using public transportation… as well as in indoor transportation hubs, such as airports and stations.""Youngkin follows the law and respects those around him by wearing a mask whenever and wherever it is necessary," Youngkin campaign spokesman Christian Martinez told Fox News."Terry McAuliffe said he wants to make life difficult for everyone else, but apparently he himself has difficulty taking the pandemic seriously and following federal law," Martinez said. "Just like all the other politicians with their mandates, he thinks the rules are for everyone else."CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPMartinez added: "McAuliffe loves to play politics with COVID, but he failed his own leadership test when he traveled to a COVID hot spot, demonstrating once again that he is all talk and no action."McAuliffe, 64, won Virginia's Democratic primary in June. A former businessman and investor, McAuliffe served as governor from 2014 to 2018. He served as chairman of Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign in 2008 and as chairman of the Democratic National Committee from 2001 to 2005.McAuliffe is facing off against Youngkin for governor on Nov. 2.Brooke Singman is a Fox News Digital politics reporter.

The Biden Administration is once again flouting our laws and precedents to push their radical agenda," Attorney General Mark Brnovich said in a statement.REPUBLICANS EXPLODE WITH FURY OVER BIDEN VACCINE MANDATE: ‘ABSOLUTELY UNCONSTITUTIONAL’Biden announced the measures last week, which require federal workers and private sector workers in businesses with more than 100 employees be vaccinated or take aCOVIDtest weekly, as part of an action plan to combat the virus.Arizona complaint on Biden vaccine regulationsbyFox Newson Scribd"We've been patient but our patience is wearing thin and your refusal has cost all of us," Biden said from the White House. "This is not about freedom or personal choice. It's about protecting yourself and those around you."The mandate, which is expected to affect as many as 100 million Americans in an array of jobs, including health care, directly impacts the private sector.Republicans have describedthe move as an "unconstitutional" act of federal coercion that should be challenged or resisted.Specifically, theArizona lawsuitcontrasts the mandates with thelack of mandate for those entering the country illegallyvia the U.S. southern border, where there has been a surge in migrant encounters – with more than 212,000 in July alone. While approximately 40% of those encounters result an expulsion via Title 42 public health protections, many other migrants have been released into the U.S., which has led to concerns about the risk of potential COVID-19 spread."There can be no serious or scientific discussion about containing the spread of COVID-19 that doesn’t begin at our southern border," Brnovich said.CONGRESS EXEMPT FROM BIDEN'S COVID-19 VACCINE MANDATEThe lawsuit argues that the mandate violates the Equal Protection Clause by allegedly favoring migrants who have come into the country illegally over American citizens."Although the precise contours of the federal vaccination mandates are not yet clear, the violation of the Equal Protection Clause is already evident and egregious," the brief says. "In a nutshell: unauthorized aliens will not be subject toanyvaccination requirements even when released directly into the United States (where most will remain), while roughly ahundred millionU.S. citizens will be subject to unprecedented vaccination requirements.""This reflects an unmistakable -- and unconstitutional -- brand of favoritism in favor of unauthorized aliens," it says.It also cites a retweet byWhite Housechief of staff Ronald Klein, whoretweeteda claim that the move was the "ultimate work-around" for the federal government to require vaccines.PSAKI STANDS BY HAVING EMPLOYER VACCINE MANDATE WHILE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS GET A PASS"The inadvertent admission in the preceding paragraph makes all of the administration’s actions constitutionally suspect," it says. "These other violations will be the subject of future challenges."CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPOther Republican states have also indicated that they intend to sue the administration as well."This is an egregious, tyrannical power grab that stands no chance in court," Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said.

Let’s end the politics. Let’s follow the science," he wrote in a November 2020 tweet.But internal administration battles call into question whether the president is following the scienceor leading it.Two senior officials at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are reportedly leaving over the Biden administration's efforts to promote and urge booster shots before their own scientists have signed off on them.Additionally, the White House and the FDA are also reportedly clashing with officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).Biden and the FDA are reportedly accusing the CDC of withholding crucial data that would help shape the administration’s plan to push COVID-19 booster shots, according to a recentPoliticoreport that cited several administration officials.Two of the officials spoke about their frustration when senior officials bucked Biden’s booster shot plan by pushing the prioritization of shots for frontline health care workers and elderly Americans.Weeks before, CDC Director Rochelle Walensky had signed onto an endorsement of Biden’s booster plan with other top Biden administration health officials.Some officials are fed up with the White House’s timeline and vaccination goals, saying the administration’s expectations are not realistic and are part of a push to get good press."Science takes time," one CDC official told Politico. "I don’t know how many times we have to say this.""The CDC is getting out what it can when it can," said another official, who also remarked that the White House’s vow to follow the science was crumbling behind the curtain.Another senior health official fired back at the notion that the Sept. 20 booster target date was forced on Walensky, saying the time frame was agreed upon by senior health officials in August.The FDA told Politico in a statement that the agency’s "longstanding collaboration with CDC continues to have a positive impact on our nation's public health.""Particularly for vaccines, our agencies have always had, and continue to have, shared responsibilities where FDA makes regulatory decisions and CDC's immunization advisory committee provides clinical recommendations," the agency said.When asked for comment by Fox News, the White House pointed to the Department of Health and Human Services’announcementon the booster shots.The hurricane of cacophony surrounding the Biden administration belies a bigger issue: Biden himself is undermining his own promise of following the science by simply not doing so.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThe two FDA officials — Office of Vaccines Research and Review director Marion Gruber and deputy director Phil Krause — are reportedly stepping down from their posts in protest of the Biden administration's push for booster shots.They and a group of other leading scientists recently asserted that the available evidencedoesn't yet supportencouraging COVID booster shots for all Americans."Careful and public scrutiny of the evolving data will be needed to assure that decisions about boosting are informed by reliable science more than by politics," they and an international group of scientists wrote, adding in part: "Widespread boosting should be undertaken only if there is clear evidence that it is appropriate."Fox News’ Kayla Rivas contributed reporting.Houston Keene is a reporter for Fox News Digital.

Col. Paul Douglas Hague, tweeted out by his wife and shared with Fox News, said he was resigning from the Army after 19 years of service and forgoing his pension primarily because of the Pentagon'smandatory COVID-19 vaccination orderfor all U.S. military service members.PENTAGON ORDERS COVID-19 VACCINATIONS FOR SERVICE MEMBERS"First, and foremost, I am incapable of subjecting myself to the unlawful, unethical, immoral and tyrannical order to sit still and allow a serum to be injected into my flesh against my will and better judgment," Hague, who is stationed at Fort Bragg in North Carolina, wrote in the letter. "It is impossible for this so-called ‘vaccine’ to have been studied adequately to determine the long-term effects."The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said the vaccines are safe and effective.Hague listed multiple other reasons for his resignation, including what he views as "an ideologically Marxist takeover of the United States government at their upper echelons," and "a complete lack of confidence" in the Biden administration, which he blamed for the Kabul terrorist attack last month that killed 13 U.S. service members."I would like nothing more than to continue in the Army to reach my 20 years of active federal service and retire with my pension," he wrote. "However, I instead will join those who have served before me in pledging my Life, my Fortune, and my Sacred Honor to continue resisting the eternal and ever-mutable forms of oppression and tyranny – both from enemies outside our nation‘s borders, and those within."Hague’s wife, Katie Phipps Hague, told Fox News her husband submitted the letter on Aug. 30 and that it has since been "sent up his chain of command" and appears to be "going smoothly" so far. She also sought to clarify some discrepancies in the letter that critics used in an effort to debunk the story.For instance, the letter is originally dated Aug. 23, but the Kabul attack occurred three days later. Phipps Hague said her husband began drafting the letter on Aug. 23, revised it multiple times, and forgot to change the original date before submitting it on Aug. 30.Phipps Hague also responded to skeptics on Twitter who asked why her husband didn’t protest the multiple other vaccines he had to take in order to serve in the military."He didn’t resign over a vaccine," sheresponded. "He said he felt the vaccine was being used as a political tool to divide and segregate Americans. He then went on to list many other reasons for his resignation – none of which have anything to do with vaccines."Hague confirmed to Fox News that his resignation process has begun and that he still stands by what he said.When reached for comment, Army spokesman Lt.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.Dozens of State Patrol troopers, firefighters and other state employees have filed a lawsuit againstWashingtonGov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, for his COVID-19vaccine mandate, alleging he is overstepping his authority and violating state law.Thelawsuit, filed Friday by Seattle attorney Nathan Arnold in Walla Walla County Superior Court, lays out seven causes of action against Inslee and pays particular attention to the nature of the state's religious exemptions, which plaintiffs allege constitute a deprivation of religious freedom under the state Constitution.In August, Insleeorderedall state employees to receive the COVID-19 vaccine by Oct. 18 or face being fired. Washington state's vaccine mandate is one of the strictest in the country.CONGRESS EXEMPT FROM BIDEN’S COVID-19 VACCINE MANDATEAmong the more than 90 individual plaintiffs, more than 53 are State Patrol employees, some are Department of Corrections employees, and several others work for the fire department or state ferry system."Some Plaintiffs have, as a right by statute and a right secured by the Washington Constitution, sought a religious exemption from the Governor’s Mandate," the lawsuit says in part. "As a condition of considering the Plaintiffs’ religious exemptions, the state or its agencies have required the submission of a ‘religious questionnaire’ which improperly inquired into protected private affairs regarding health care decisions and religious sentiment, belief, and worship."The lawsuit included screenshots of emails in which Inslee’s General Counsel Kathryn Leathers discussed exemption language with the state attorney general’s office. The complaint singled out what Leathers wrote in an Aug. 3, 2021 email: "Exemptions: medical for sure; and religious (if we have to; if yes, as narrow as possible)."The lawsuit went on to allege that some of the plaintiffs who submitted the religious exemption questionnaire requested "have had their religious sincerity questioned and have been forced to provide additional information."CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP"The Plaintiffs each face deprivation of their life, liberty, or property as a direct consequence of both the State’s inquiries on the religious questionnaire which is not consistent with due process, and the Governor’s Mandate which was not properly or legally enacted, and which is not consistent with due process," the lawsuit states."These requirements are in full compliance with the law.

Biden also announced that all employees of the federal government would be required to receive a COVID-19 vaccine."It shouldn’t be necessary," Trump said, referring to the mandates which have drawn criticism from Republicans and some in the private sector.SURGEON GENERAL: COVID NUMBERS DEEPLY CONCERNING, SAYS VACCINES ‘DOING ITS JOB’The Trump administration created Operation Warp Speed, a public-private partnership to create vaccines against the novel coronavirus, as the pandemic raged in 2020. Under his administration, the Food and Drug Administration approved emergency use authorizations (EUA) for the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines.Trump, in December 2020, signed an executive order that would ensure all Americans had access to coronavirus vaccines before the U.S. government could begin aiding nations around the world.Trump, in the exclusive Fox News interview, said that during his administration, more people were interested in getting vaccinated against COVID-19."If you remember, when I was president, there were literally lines of people wanting to take it," Trump said, pointing to vaccine hesitancy among some Americans. "Now, you have a different situation, and it’s very bad."Trump went on to point to comments made by some Democrats, including future Vice President Kamala Harris, who said they may not trust the effectiveness of a vaccine that he was pushing."Of course, they famously said, if Trump came up with it, I’ll never take it," Trump recalled."They disparaged the vaccine, and now they wonder why people aren’t wanting to take it?" He continued. "It’s a disgrace.""Look, it was one of my greatest achievements doing it in less than nine months instead of five years, or maybe never," Trump said, referring to the approval timeline for some vaccines at the FDA. "We saved millions of people all over the world."But pointing back to those against getting a jab, Trump said: "They don’t trust this president, and that’s why they’re not taking it."Trump and former first lady Melania Trump received both doses of a COVID-19 vaccine in January at the White House. It is unclear which vaccine they received. Trump talked up the vaccines' benefits in aninterviewwith Fox News' Greg Gutfeld last week, saying infections among the vaccinated were less severe compared to the unvaccinated at the start of the pandemic: "If you do get sick, you don’t get sick like they were before, meaning you don’t die."BIDEN TO ANNOUNCE VACCINE MANDATE FOR COMPANIES WITH MORE THAN 100 EMPLOYEESThe Biden administration has made a significant push in promoting COVID-19 vaccines, launching door-to-door efforts over the summer, to help communities receive information and resources regarding how and when they could receive their doses.The Biden administration, in July, also sought to incentivize Americans by urging state and local governments to use coronavirus relief funds to pay citizens $100 each to get vaccinated.The proposals came amid concerns over breakthrough cases, infections among vaccinated individuals, and the strengthening delta variant became prominent in communities across the country.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPMeanwhile, with COVID-19caseson the rise again in the U.S., health officials are urging the public to vaccinate themselves against the deadly disease, warning that the overwhelming majority of deaths and hospitalizations from the delta variantcontinue to be among unvaccinated Americans.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, over 178 million people in the United States have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19.Brooke Singman is a Fox News Digital politics reporter.

Gavin Newsomis teaming up on the campaign trail with his most high-profileDemocraticsurrogate to date as he tries to save his job steering the nation’s most populous state.Newsom will be joined byPresident Bidenon Monday at an election eve rally in the southern California city of Long Beach in an effort to convince Golden State Democrats and independents to hand their ballots in and vote against the recall.NEWSOM SPOTLIGHTS COVID, THE ISSUE THAT SPARKED THE CALIFORNIA RECALL, AS HE FIGHTS TO KEEP HIS JOBThe event with Biden is the culmination of a push by thegovernor, his political team and allies launched earlier this year to nationalize the recall drive by characterizing it as aRepublican"power grab." The embattled governor this summer has turned to well-known and influential Democrats and progressives to help inform and motivate California Democrats to vote, and in the past two months he has used thecoronavirus pandemic– the issue that last year sparked the recall effort – to warn about morbid consequences if a conservative Republican replaces him in running the state."This election is a choice about life and death," Newsom charged at an event in the Bay Area withVice President Kamala Harrislast Wednesday.Vice President Kamala Harris stands on stage with California Gov. Gavin Newsom at the conclusion of a campaign event at the IBEW-NECA Joint Apprenticeship Training Center in San Leandro, Calif., Wednesday, Sept. 8, 2021. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster)"California has among the lowest [COVID] case rates in America, and among the highestvaccinationrates in America, because we believe in science, we believe in public health. We’re not ideological, we’re open to argument and interested in evidence," the governor emphasized.In the closing weeks of the recall campaign, Newsom has been touting his efforts to combat the coronavirus, the worst global pandemic in a century, and warning what may happen if he’s replaced by a conservative Republican in the governor’s office. By doing so, the governor has been shining a spotlight on the issue, which over a year ago triggered the efforts to oust him, following accusations that Newsom mishandled the Golden State’s response to the coronavirus with heavy-handed mandates that flattened the economy.HERE'S WHO'S AIMING TO SUCCEED NEWSOM IN CALIFORNIA'S RECALL ELECTIONNewsom has repeatedly compared California’s COVID rates to much higher ones in large states with conservative governors, such as Texas and Florida. And the governor has also taken aim atLarry Elder, the conservative talk radio host and the polling and fundraising front-runner among the 46 gubernatorial replacement candidates on the recall ballot, who has said he’d halt the state’svaccineand mask requirements if elected."His model is Texas and Florida, and Mississippi," Newsom charged recently. "We have among the lowest positivity rates in America. They have the highest positivity rates in America. We have one of the lowest case rates in America. They’re among the highest."California has vaccine verification or testing requirements for state workers, school staff and health care workers. The state has also implemented universal masking for K-12 students at public schools.ELDER URGES SUPPORTERS TO REPORT ‘ANYTHING SUSPICIOUS’ IN RECALL ELECTIONS"I know that Gavin Newsom has mandated that every state worker who has not been vaccinated be tested once a week and wear a face mask at work. I’m going to repeal that before I have my first cup of coffee," Elder pledged on the campaign trail earlier this month.Many of the other leading Republican replacement candidates have joined Elder in saying that while they don’t oppose vaccines, they would roll back Newsom’s statewide vaccine mandates for those working for the state, in health care and at schools.But the governor argues that such moves would set California back in its battle to combat the coronavirus and recently emphasized that "there is no more consequential decision to the health and safety of the people, the state of California, than voting ‘no’ on this Republican recall."WILL NEWSOM'S MASSIVE AIRWAVES ADVANTAGE HELP HIM SAVE HIS JOB?FormerPresident Obama, who remains extremely popular among Democrats, says in a TV ad for Newsom, which is running statewide, that the governor "has spent the past year and a half protecting California communities. Now Republicans are trying to recall him from office and overturn common-sense COVID safety measures for health care workers and school staff."Voters are being asked two questions on the Newsom recall ballots. The first question is whether the governor should be removed from office. If more than 50% support removing Newsom, the second question offers a list of candidates running to replace the governor. If the governor is recalled, the candidate who wins the most votes on the second question – regardless of whether it’s a majority or just a small plurality – would succeed Newsom in steering California.The governor and his team for months have framed the recall drive against him as an effort by the far right, supporters offormer President Trump, national Republicans and conservative media to oust him. The political effort to save his job is called "Stop the Republican Recall."Newsom told a crowd at a recent rally that while Trump was defeated by Biden in November’s presidential election, "we did not defeat Trumpism…it is still alive across this country." And spotlighting his fight, the governor said "it has come to the state of California."NEWSOM SPOTLIGHTS TRUMP AS HE FIGHTS TO SURVIVE CALIFORNIA RECALLIt’s no surprise that over the past six weeks Newsom and his allies have been regularly blasting Elder. They’ve sent out press releases, fundraising emails, social media posts and indirectly targeted Elder in ads, highlighting his opposition to having any minimum wage, his downplaying of climate change and the nation’s issues with racial inequity, his controversial comments about women -- and tying him to Trump.Newsom emphasized last month that it’s "important to focus on Larry" because he argued that Elder’s "even more extreme than Trump in many respects."Conservative radio talk show host Larry Elder speaks to supporters during a campaign stop outside the Hall of Justice downtown Los Angeles, Thursday, Sept. 2, 2021. Elder is running to replace Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom in the Sept. 14 recall election. (AP Photo/Damian Dovarganes)(AP )It’s not just Elder.Newsom’s recall campaign team has also targeted another of the leading GOP replacement candidates – former two-term San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer – by spotlighting a photo of him beside then-President Trump in the Oval Office.Newsom’s strategy is simple: Trump, outside of his conservative base, is extremely unpopular in the very blue state of California. The then-president lost the Golden State and its whopping 55 electoral votes by over 5 million votes to Biden last November. And Newsom – who won election as governor in 2018 by 24 points - and his allies acknowledge that they need a strong turnout to counter Republican voters motivated to cast ballots in Tuesday’s election in hopes of ousting the governor.FROM BIDEN TO HARRIS TO SANDERS AND WARREN, TOP DEMOCRATS HELP NEWSOM IN RECALL'S CLOSING DAYS"The longer Donald Trump stays in political conversations the longer Democrats will effectively communicate that Republican candidates are mere ‘Baby Donalds,’ and that will always juice Democratic Party turnout," veteran California-based Democratic consultant Mike Trujillo told Fox News.The biggest stars are lending Newsom a helping hand.In addition to the president and vice president,Sen. Elizabeth Warrenof Massachusetts, a progressive leader who also unsuccessfully ran for the White House in 2020, andSen. Amy Klobucharof Minnesota, another Democratic presidential contender last cycle, each teamed up with Newsom at rallies earlier this month.It’s not just on the campaign trail where the governor's getting a lift from top surrogates. Both Obama andSen. Bernie Sandersof Vermont, the progressive champion and runner-up to Biden in the 2020 Democratic presidential primaries, are both making the pitch for Newsom in TV spots.Newsom’s strategy may be working.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPMost public opinion polls conducted in July and August indicated that likely voters were divided on whether to recall Newsom.But the latest surveys conducted over the past three weeks suggest that a solid majority of likely voters in the recall election support keeping the governor in office.Get all the stories you need-to-know from the most powerful name in news delivered first thing every morning to your inboxSubscribedYou've successfully subscribed to this newsletter!This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2022 FOX News Network, LLC.

Pete Ricketts discusses GOP state leaders' pushback against Biden's federal COVID-19 vaccine mandate.Vice President Kamala Harrisgot the ball rolling on the politicization of COVID-19 vaccines when she declared at her sole vice presidential debate that she would not roll up her sleeve to take the jab approved by regulators under the Trump administration,Chris Christie,the former New Jersey governor, said."That put us in a totally different area that allowed it to be politicized and that politicization is just continuing now" he told ABC’s "This Week" on Sunday.President Biden recentlyannounced a new mandate to get more Americans to sign up to take a COVID-19 jab because about 80 million people in the country have refused to voluntarily sign up for the shot. One of the main reasons is that people are skeptical of potential side effects and their effectiveness.Harris, in October, used the coronavirus outbreak and the federal government’s response as an example of what she identified as the Trump administration's shortcomings. She indicated that she would be skeptical of former President Trump’s involvement in any vaccine rollout."If the public health professionals, if Dr. Fauci, if the doctors tell us we should take it, I’ll be the first in line to take it, absolutely," Harris said. "But if Donald Trump tells us we should take it, I’m not taking it," she said.Her critics said that comment planted the seed of doubt in the minds of Americans and the issue suddenly became political. Her supporters say that Trump was cavalier when it came to the virus and it was fair that she had legitimate doubts.Former Vice President Mike Pence, who was interviewed on Fox News’"Life, Liberty & Levin,"told host, Mark Levin, that Harris and other Democrats  need to "stop playing politics with people’s lives by undermining confidence in a safe and effective vaccine."Pence said Trump has tried to speed up the vaccine through initiatives likeOperation Warp Speed, but said no corners have been cut when it comes to safety. He said any vaccine that would be released to the public would be vetted and approved by several agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration."So to have Kamala Harris say,  two, three times in a row that she would refuse to take the vaccine that was produced under the Trump administration" is unconscionable, he said.Harris’ office did not immediately respond to an after-hours email from Fox News.Politifact reported that Harris was asked in a month before the debate if she would take the vaccine and she responded, "Well, I think that's going to be an issue for all of us. I will say that I would not trust Donald Trump. And it would have to be a credible source of information that talks about the efficacy and the reliability of whatever he's talking about. I will not take his word for it. He wants us to inject bleach. I — no, I will not take his word."The report pointed out that Biden even questioned any vaccine delivered during the Trump years."Look at what’s happened. Enormous pressure put on the CDC not to put out the detailed guidelines. The enormous pressure being put on the FDA to say they’re going, that the following protocol will in fact reduce, it will have a giant impact on COVID. All these things turn out not to be true, and when a president continues to mislead and lie,when we finally do, God willing, get a vaccine, who’s going to take the shot? Who’s going to take the shot? You going to be the first one to say, ‘Put me — sign me up, they now say it’s OK’? I’m not being facetious."Biden and Harris have been major vaccine supporters.GET THE FOX NEWS APP"My message to unvaccinated Americans is this: what more is there to wait for? What more do you need to see? We have made vaccinations free, safe, & convenient. The vaccine is FDA approved. Over 200 million Americans have gotten at least one shot. We have been patient, but our patience is wearing thin, and the refusal has cost all of us,"Biden said at a press conference on Thursday.Edmund DeMarche is a senior news editor for FoxNews.com.

Psaki was asked in a White House press briefing Friday.BIDEN 'DISAPPOINTED' IN GOP GOVERNORS WHO PLAN TO RESIST VACCINE MANDATE: 'HAVE AT IT'"This is a tool and a step that we have legal authority for," Psaki responded. "But no, we don't have the ability to tell every American you have to be vaccinated. There’s a means of encouraging it, of mandating it through certain pathways, and that’s exactly what we’ve done."The administration, and Psaki on Friday, has sought to characterize the workplace requirement as a health regulation that falls under the purview of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Critics have characterized it as an unconstitutional unilateral federal mandate masquerading as a health provision.Psaki’s comment comes after White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain wasslammedfor retweeting  MSNBC’s Stephanie Ruhle’s description of Biden’s employer vaccine mandate as a "workaround.""OSHA doing this vaxx mandate as an emergency workplace safety rule is the ultimate work-around for the Federal govt to require vaccinations," the tweet said.WHITE HOUSE’S RON KLAIN PANNED FOR RETWEETING POST ON ‘ULTIMATE WORK-AROUND’ FOR FEDERAL VACCINE MANDATEConstitutional scholar Jonathan Turleycalledthe retweet "breathtakingly daft.""The retweet was breathtakingly daft on the eve of litigation over the order, Turley said.

"The Occupational Safety and Health Act...requires the Department of Labor, take action when it finds grave risk to workers. Certainly, a pandemic...qualifies as grave risk."When pressed another time, Psaki insisted that the mandate was vetted by legal experts and scoffed that it "doesn’t even take a legal degree" to understand that the mandate is legal.Andrew Mark Miller is a writer at Fox News.

Tate Reeves threatens legal action on 'The Ingraham Angle'Constitutional scholar Jonathan Turley calledWhite Housechief of staff Ron Klain’s recent retweet appearing to praise the Biden administration for executing the "ultimate work-around" forPresident Biden’s recentvaccinemandate "breathtakingly daft.""The retweet was breathtakingly daft on the eve of litigation over the order. It is reminiscent of President Biden admitting that his own White House counsel and their preferred legal experts all said that the eviction moratorium extension was likely unconstitutional," Turley told Fox News on Friday."Courts will now be asked to ignore the admission and uphold a self-admitted evasion of constitutional limits," Turley added. The "problem is that the thing being ‘worked around’ is the Constitution."BIDEN DECLARES SWEEPING NEW VACCINE MANDATE: 'THIS IS NOT ABOUT FREEDOM'Turley’s comment came in response to Klain retweeting MSNBC’s Stephanie Ruhle on Thursday, who tweeted: "OSHA doing this vaxx mandate as an emergency workplace safety rule is the ultimate work-around for the Federal govt to require vaccinations.""Klain effectively became a witness for the challengers in labeling the order an evasion or subterfuge designed for the courts. Klain leaves the courts in the unenviable position of ratifying an order that the Administration admits is a mere work around to evade constitutional limits. It is akin to claiming self-defense in an assault case while saying that it was the best way to shoot the guy," Turley said.Klain’s retweet came after President Biden announced a sweeping mandate requiring private employers with more than 100 employees to be vaccinated or submit to weekly testing. The mandate affects about 80 million Americans.About 17 million workers at health facilities who receive federal Medicare or Medicaid will also be required to get vaccinated. The rules will be enforced by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.WHITE HOUSE’S RON KLAIN PANNED FOR RETWEETING POST ON ‘ULTIMATE WORK-AROUND’ FOR FEDERAL VACCINE MANDATE"We’ve been patient. But our patience is wearing thin, and your refusal has cost all of us," Biden said in remarks Thursday, adding that the unvaccinated, "can cause a lot of damage, and they are."Klain sparked pushback from Republicans and other critics, including Sen. Ted Cruz, who called it "foolish,"  and added, "He said the quiet part out loud. Biden admin knows it’s likely illegal (like the eviction moratorium) but they don’t."Both Cruz and Turley referred to the Supreme Court’s ruling last month that prohibited the Biden administration from continuing its temporary eviction moratorium stemming from the pandemic, ruling the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lacked the authority to reimpose the moratorium without Congress’s approval.SUPREME COURT STRIKES DOWN BIDEN ADMINISTRATION'S EVICTION MORATORIUMTurley added in his comments to Fox News that "ironically" during the previous administration, former President Trump was accused of undermining the Department of Justice "with ill-conceived and self-defeating public statements.""Ironically, Democratic groups long argued that such public comments from Trump or his staff should be treated as official statements. Courts regularly used Trump tweets in reviewing challenges in fields like immigration."CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPHe added that Klain’s retweet "can be referenced by the courts as illustrative of the motive behind this obviously awkward avenue for a mandate.

Thomas Massie, R-Ky, wrote in a tweet, attaching a link to the news."Mandates are not the answer," Rep. Neal Dunn, R-Fla., said in response. "Getting the vaccine should be up to you and your doctor — not the federal government.""All 9 million federal employees should consult with their doctor and make a personal, informed decision about taking the vaccine," wrote Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo. "Instead, Sleepy Joe says take it or else… You don’t lead by coercion. Biden has failed as a leader in every way.""This is unconstitutional," said Rep. Robert Aderholt, R-Ala. "The U.S. Constitution does not give the President this type of authority. No where in Article 2 of the Constitution will you find anything that even remotely gives the President this kind of power.""The federal government has no authority to force businesses in Texas and across the country to mandate their employees get vaccinated. American businesses are still recovering from this past year and a half. It is cruel and burdensome to impose this authoritarian mandate," Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said in a statement Friday."While I support the vaccine and have received it, Americans have the right to exercise personal choice when it comes to their health. Getting the vaccine is a decision to be made in consultation with one’s doctor, not forced on Americans by the government."Arizona Republican Gov. Doug Ducey vowed to "push back" against Biden."This is exactly the kind of big government overreach we have tried so hard to prevent in Arizona — now the Biden-Harris administration is hammering down on private businesses and individual freedoms in an unprecedented and dangerous way," Ducey wrote. "This will never stand up in court.""This dictatorial approach is wrong, un-American and will do far more harm than good," Ducey added in another tweet. "How many workers will be displaced? How many kids kept out of classrooms? How many businesses fined? The vaccine is and should be a choice. We must and will push back.""I strongly oppose Biden’s authoritarian vaccine mandate on Americans, and believe it is a massive government overreach," said Rep. Lloyd Smucker, R-Pa.Republican South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem also weighed in on the news, saying the state is ready to hold the Biden administration legally responsible for the "unconstitutional rule.""My legal team is standing by ready to file our lawsuit the minute @joebiden files his unconstitutional rule," Noem wrote in a tweet. "This gross example of federal intrusion will not stand.""Elections have consequences," said Rep. Mo Brooks, R-Ala, as he shared the news on Twitter. "Biden’s mandate underscores how important it is for Americans to know & weigh candidates’ policies when voting. Liberty & freedom are at stake."Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., vowed to introduce legislation to "block" the mandates.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP"I will be introducing legislation to block this egregious assault on Americans' freedom and liberty," Biggs said. "We must fight against these attempts to force vaccine mandates on the American people.""This is blatantly unconstitutional," wrote Rep. Barry Moore, R-Ala., in a tweet. "The decision to get vaccinated lies between you and your doctor - NOT the federal government. We must fight back against medical tyranny that dangerously violates Americans' individual freedoms.""The president's action crosses the line," said Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-S.D. "I believe in the vaccine, but I also believe in a limited federal government. Effectively, this is a national vaccine mandate. Our federal government has never done this before, and it should not do so now."In a statement to Fox News, Rep. Greg Murphy, R-N.C., who serves as one of only a few practicing physicians in Congress and is a member of the GOP Doctors Caucus, said he is against government vaccine mandates, saying the decision should be made by patients who have consulted with their doctors."As I have repeatedly said, the decision about whether or not to take the COVID-19 vaccine, like every other medical decision, is one that should be made between a patient and a doctor," Murphy said. "The government does not know what is best for each patient, nor do they have the authority to dictate patient-doctor health care decisions."Kyle Morris covers politics for Fox News.

"We are in a pandemic. We have children who cannot be protected by avaccination."The governor’s order allowed parents to decide if they want their kids to wear masks to school rather than have local school districts make the decision, prompting a lawsuit brought by a group of parents in favor of school mask mandates.FLORIDA GOV.

"They protect the most vulnerable, people with disabilities and fragile immune systems, children too young to be vaccinated, and communities of color hit hard by the disease."ARIZONA AG DECLARES TUCSON'S COVID VACCINE MANDATE FOR CITY EMPLOYEES ‘ILLEGAL’The authors of the piece argue that vaccines are a "justifiable intrusion on autonomy and bodily integrity" while acknowledging that "may sound ominous" but "the fundamental right to bodily integrity is not 'absolute" and does "not include the right to inflict harm on others."Journalist Glenn Greenwaldrespondedto the piece by saying it sounds like an "NSA official justifying the need for mass surveillance" and pointed out that the ACLU has been opposed to vaccine mandates in the past."What makes the ACLU's position so remarkable — besides the inherent shock of acivil liberties organizationchampioningstate mandates overriding individual choice— is that, very recently, the same group warned of the grave dangers of the very mindset it is now pushing," Greenwald wrote on his Substack page. "In 2008, the ACLU publisheda comprehensive reporton pandemics which had one primary purpose: to denounce as dangerous and unnecessary attempts by the state to mandate, coerce, and control in the name of protecting the public from pandemics."SEATTLE COULD LOSE OVER 200 COPS DUE TO COVID VACCINE MANDATE, REPORT SAYSIn the ACLU’s 2008report, the group warned that "not all public health interventions have been benign or beneficial, however. Too often, fears aroused by disease and epidemics have encouraged abuses of state power. Atrocities, large and small, have been committed in the name of protecting the public’s health."Greenwald added, "The ACLU'sNew York Timesop-ed this week repeatedly stressed that coercive mandates are justified whenever ‘the disease is highly transmissible, serious and lethal.’ But its 2008 report argued exactly the opposite. The report was critical of forced vaccinations and other mandates in prior outbreaks of smallpox — certainly a highly contagious and lethal disease — but then argued that when the disease reappeared in the late 1940s, New York City handled it much better by offering voluntary vaccines and education programs rather than coercive measures."GET THE FOX NEWS APPThe ACLU’s shift in position comes as governments and businesses across the United States are grappling with the idea of requiring citizens and employees to get vaccinated against the coronavirus.New York CityMayorBill de Blasioenacteda plan this summer forcing residents of his city to show proof of vaccination in order to enter restaurants, bars, and gyms.

"COVID-19 vaccinations should be a choice, not a government mandate."TUCSON SHOOTING: 2 DEAD, SEVERAL INJURED, INCLUDING EMT PERSONNEL, NEAR HOUSE FIRE; KIDS MISSINGArizona lawmakers recently passed S.B. 1824, which forbids city governments from imposing the COVID vaccine mandates on its employees. However, exploiting a loophole in the statute delaying the law from taking effect until Sept. 29, Tucson announced that public employees would be required to provide proof of COVID vaccinate by 4:00 p.m. on Aug. 24 or be suspended without pay.Governor Doug Ducey issued an executive order in response to the city of Tucson's announcement, in order to stop cities from implementing vaccine mandates before Sept. 29, but Tucson did not rescind its vaccination requirement.The attorney general’s office (AGO) reached its conclusion following an investigation that found the mandate was in violation of both state statute and gubernatorial order and must be "rescinded or amended."Brnovich's office warned that "if the City of Tucson does not rescind its policy within the next 30 days, the AGO will notify the Arizona Treasurer, who will withhold the city’s portion of state shared revenue until it comes into compliance.""Additionally, the AGO believes the City of Tucson could subject itself to potential liability claims if it were to take adverse action against an employee who relies on E.O. 2021-18 and state law to refuse the vaccine," the attorney general's office says.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThe announcement comes afterweeksof investigation by Brnovich’s office.Tucson city council member Steve Kozachik pushed back on the determination, telling Fox News in an emailed statement that "Brnovich needs to put away the political science book and try reading real science.""There’s nothing illegal about our local ordinance, it comports with CDC recommendations and is in the best interest of public health," Kozachik said. "There’s a process, and we’ll avail ourselves of that defending what we have in place. In the meantime, I’d encourage all of our employees, and all of our residents to get a vaccination so we can put this all behind us."Another city councilman, Paul Cunningham, said he "respectfully disagrees" with Brnovich and stands by city’s vaccine mandate policy.Tucson Mayor Regina Romero and the rest of the Tucson city council did not immediately respond to Fox News’ requests for comment.Fox News' Kelly Laco contributed to this report.Houston Keene is a reporter for Fox News Digital.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.TheWhite Housewarned Friday that theUnited Statesis "not adequately prepared" to handle future pandemics and other "high consequence biological threats," and rolled out a strategy that would "fundamentally transform" the nation's ability to prevent, detect and rapidly respond to pandemics and threats.In a report released Friday by the White House Office of Science and Technology and the National Security Council, officials warned that the U.S., currently, is "not adequately prepared" to handle future pandemics, warning that "serious" biological threats are expected to occur "at an increasing frequency."FAUCI: 'MU' COVID VARIANT NOT AN 'IMMEDIATE THREAT' TO AMERICANSPresident Biden'stop science advisor and White House Office of Science & Technology Policy (OSTP) Director Dr. Eric Lander warned Friday that another pandemic could "occur soon," possibly within the next decade, and would "likely be substantially different than COVID-19.""We must be prepared to deal with any kind of viral threats," he said.The effort to transform U.S. response capabilities is expected to cost $65.3 billion— a dollar figure officials said "should not be viewed as a cost, but instead as providing a large return on investment.""Investing a modest amount annually to avert or mitigate the huge toll of future pandemics and other biological threats is an economic and moral imperative," the report states. "It’s hard to imagine a higher economic—or human—return on national investment."The investments would include those in critical scientific goal areas like vaccines, therapeutics, diagnostics, and early warning, as well as other investments in strengthening disease surveillance, health systems, surge capacity, personal protective equipment, innovation, biosafety and biosecurity, regulatory capacity, and global pandemic preparedness.""Biological threats are increasing, whether naturally occurring, accidental, or deliberate, and the likelihood of a catastrophic biological event is similarly increasing," the report states.Officials warned that new infectious diseases have been emerging at a "quickening pace" due to  "increased zoonotic transmission from animals, driven by population growth, climate change, habitat loss, and human behavior," adding that the diseases are "spreading faster" with increased global travel.Officials also warned that the number of laboratories around the world handling "dangerous pathogens" is growing, in part, as a response to an increased risk of pandemics, but also "boosting the likelihood that a contagious pathogen could be released accidentally."Officials also warned that as technologies of modern biology become more powerful, affordable, and accessible, there is the "disturbing possibility that a malign actor could develop and use a biological weapon, including one that is highly contagious," and in violation of the Biological Weapons Convention and UN Security Council Resolution 1540.A senior administration official told Fox News that the administration’s plan is not a response to an "immediate threat." The plan states that technologies of modern biology are becoming more powerful, affordable and accessible, which they say "makes real the disturbing possibility that a malign actor could develop and use a biological weapon.""The administration is dedicated to guarding against that risk, through this preparedness plan, which emphasizes safety and security, as well as our work in parallel to strengthen the Biological Weapons Convention; deter, prevent, detect, and respond to the development and use of biological weapons from states or terrorists; increase biosafety and biosecurity around the world with partners around the world, and reduce catastrophic biological risks," the official told Fox News.COVID-19 VACCINATIONS IN RURAL AREAS HIT FASTEST PACE IN 6 WEEKS: REPORTWhite House national security officials outlined the administration’s work across five pillars—including transforming the United States’ medical defense; ensuring situational awareness; strengthening public health, systems; building core capabilities, and managing the mission.Transforming the U.S. medical defense system would include dramatically improving vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics. With regard to vaccines, officials said the U.S. should "enable design, testing and review of a safe and effective vaccine against any human virus within 100 days after the recognition of a potential pandemic threat."The effort would enable the production of enough vaccines for the entire U.S. population "within 130 days and for the global population within 200 days after its recognition as a potential emerging pandemic threat."CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPAs for therapeutics, officials said a range suitable for "any virus family" should be available "before a pandemic or readily created during a pandemic."According to the White House, the COVID-19 pandemic, as of mid-August 2021,COVID-19has killed more than 4.3 million people globally, with excess mortality estimates suggesting a death toll exceeding 10 million. In the U.S., the number of deaths directly attributed to COVID-19 has surpassed 623,000 with many recovered patients living with "long-term effects."Brooke Singman is a Fox News Digital politics reporter.

"The science supports their decision, and we applaud their willingness to step forward and advance the safety of our patients, staff and community. These survey results do not reflect the views of the majority of our 10,000 employees, including our 2,600 nurses across the UC Health system."Businesses, school districts, state governments, and healthcare systems across the country have been grappling with the idea of vaccine mandates and the Biden administration has urged employers and local governments to require vaccinations.The White House COVID-19 response team on Tuesday urged businesses in the country to require employees to be vaccinated.COVID-19 response coordinator Jeff Zients presented a White House briefing alongside Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and White House chief medical adviser.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP"Bottom line, vaccination requirements work," Zients said. "They drive up vaccination rates and we need more businesses and other employers, including health care systems, school districts, colleges and universities, to step up and do their part to help end the pandemic faster. We need more individuals to step up to."He continued: "We continue to push for more vaccination process, including through vaccination requirements. The president first adopted vaccination requirements for federal workers last month and now over 800 colleges and universities, 200 health care employers, small and large businesses across the country and dozens of state and local governments and schools districts have stepped up to follow the president's lead.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.At just over seven months in office, theBidenadministration is facing three major crises, any one of which would be enough to deal with.There’s the fallout from the deadlyAfghanistanwithdrawal, the continued concern about thecoronaviruspandemic and the still-unknown damage fromHurricane Ida.All are placing enormous pressure on the administration to come up with solutions – both to prevent the problems from getting worse and to help quiet critics.On Tuesday, Biden defended his decision to end U.S. involvement in Afghanistan – even at the cost of 13 American lives in last week’s terror attack in Kabul."I was not going to extend this war forever," Biden said Tuesday during a speech from the White House. And I was not going to extend a forever exit."But the way the pullout was handled – with the deaths of U.S. service members, the struggle to evacuate Americans out of Kabul and the takeover of billions of dollars in U.S. military equipment by the Taliban – has Republicans calling for Biden’s resignation.NEWT GINGRICH: BIDEN'S ‘DAMAGE’ TO US IN AFGHANISTAN DISASTER IS UNPRECEDENTED"Mr. President, if you had an ounce of respect for your 50 years of service to this nation, and to move forward toward healing, to united our nation, to get past this nightmare that you’ve created, then by God, man, resign," U.S. Rep. Clay Higgins, R-La.,said Tuesday.But Biden insisted that ending two decades of involvement in Afghanistan would ultimately prove to be the right decision."There’s nothing China or Russia would rather have, want more in this competition, than the United States to be bogged down another decade in Afghanistan," Biden said.In dealing with the coronavirus, the Biden administration – through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other outlets -- has been accused of sending unclear messages about face masks, vaccines and other policies.It has also gone seven months withno permanent leader at the helmof the Food and Drug Administration, the agency that decides if vaccines produced by companies are safe for the public to use and effective in preventing infections.Tuesday brought news that uncertainty at the FDA may be taking a toll inside the organization. The FDA reportedly confirmed that two top officialsplan to step downover disagreements with the White House about vaccine booster shots.The FDA said that Marion Gruber, director of the agency’s Office of Vaccines Research and Review, and her deputy director, Phil Krause, will leave in October and November, respectively,according to CNBC.The Food and Drug Administration sign is seen at its headquarters in Washington.They were reportedly frustrated that the CDC and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) were spearheading decisions that should be the responsibility of the FDA, the biotech news outletEndpoint Newsreported, citing a former senior FDA leader as its source.Gruber and Krause finally decided to step down after the Biden administrationwent ahead with a booster programscheduled to start the week of Sept. 20 – without FDA approval.CLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGEMeanwhile, the administration’s messaging on coronavirus safety continues to be undermined by Democrats who go against restrictions or guidance in their private lives while expecting the public to comply with the rules.In the latest example, U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., was seen maskless at a wedding in New Mexico for a member of Biden’s Cabinet – Interior Secretary Deb Haaland -- in violations of that state’s coronavirus restrictions,according to the Washington Free Beacon.Haaland alsowas seen masklessat the event, according to the report.Still unclear Tuesday was the full impact of Hurricane Ida, which slammed into Louisiana and other parts of the Gulf Coast on Sunday with winds as strong as 170 miles per hour.But the damage was seen as severe, both in New Orleans – where the entire city lost electricity on Sunday -- and in outlying areas such as Grand Isle, which the Jefferson Parish president described as "uninhabitable" at a Tuesday news conference.Ida was blamed for at least four deaths in both Louisiana and Mississippi, where two people were killed when seven vehicles fell into a 20-foot-deep hole near Lucedale.The extensive damage caused by Ida was expected to be the first major test forDeanne Criswell, who Biden appointed his administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPOn Tuesday, Criswell tweeted photos of herself meeting with Louisiana’s governor and the state’s emergency preparedness office as the hurricane response continued."We have a lot of work ahead of us and no one is under the illusion that this is going to be a short process," Gov.

The department's Office of Civil Rights (OCR) is focusing on five states –  Iowa, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee and Utah."The Department has heard from parents from across the country – particularly parents of students with disabilities and with underlying medical conditions – about how state bans on universal indoor masking are putting their children at risk and preventing them from accessing in-person learning equally," U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona said in a press release.MISSOURI AG FILES CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT AGAINST SCHOOLS ENFORCING MASK MANDATES ON CHILDREN"It’s simply unacceptable that state leaders are putting politics over the health and education of the students they took an oath to serve. The Department will fight to protect every student’s right to access in-person learning safely and the rights of local educators to put in place policies that allow all students to return to the classroom full-time in-person safely this fall."OCR will be investigating whether the states comply with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. Both address discrimination based on disabilities.The move will likely provoke backlash from conservatives who believe coronavirus restrictions have gone too far and could impact children's emotional health.Fox News previously reported on an Oklahoma district school board member who apologized after suggesting that students could commit "murder" by not wearing masks. The state had prevented local districts from imposing mask mandates under certain circumstances."Until every American citizen is safely out of Afghanistan, President Biden shouldn’t spend a single second harassing states like Oklahoma for protecting parents’ rights to make health decisions for their kids," said Carly Atchison, communications director for Gov.

With the Pfizer vaccine fully approved and with children across the country heading back to school, more than 100 congressional lawmakers last week urged the FDA to give initial authorization for COVID vaccines for those under 12 years of age as soon as possible.Fauci, in a separate interview onABC’s "This Week,"said the FDA "hopefully will be acting quickly.""The data has been collected and we should have enough data by, I would say, the end of September, middle to end of September, early October, so that those data can then be presented to the FDA to examine for the risk benefit ratio of safety and effectiveness," Fauci added.INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY SAYS ITS UNABLE TO DEFINITIVELY CONCLUDE WHERE PANDEMIC ORGINATEDAnd Fauci said public health officials are sticking with the current recommendation that people get booster shots eight months after getting the COVID vaccine, but that could change going forward."We're still sticking with the eight months," Fauci said. "However, as we've said, even in the original statement that came out, we're gonna have to go through the standard way of the (Food and Drug Administration) looking at the data and then the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. So although we're sticking with eight, we're remaining flexible, that if the data tells us differently, we'll make adjustments accordingly.

TheBidenadministration had promised federal funds for any district that lost money for requiring masks.Cooper said government actions necessary to protect public health are exempted from a new Florida law, the "Parents' Bill of Rights," that DeSantis and others had argued gave parents the final authority.FLORIDA SCHOOL DISTRICTS DEFY DESANTIS WITH MASK MANDATES FOR MOST STUDENTSThe judge said a school district’s decision to require student masking to prevent the spread of the virus falls within that exemption.Students sit in an algebra class at Barbara Coleman Senior High School on the first day of school in Miami Lakes, Fla., Aug. 23, 2021. (Associated Press)The law "doesn't ban mask mandates at all," Cooper said during a two-hour hearing that was conducted online because of the pandemic. "It doesn't require that a mask mandate must include a parental opt-out at all."Cooper also issued an injunction against the state board of education because of its enforcement of the order, according to FOX 13 of Tampa.He added the law doesn’t allow for the state to penalize school boards for their defiance, saying they deserve due process."Parents' rights are very important but they’re not without some reasonable limitations," Cooper said, according toFOX 13.The governor’s office said the state plans to appeal the ruling."It’s not surprising that Judge Cooper would rule against parents' rights and their ability to make the best educational and medical decisions for their family, but instead rule in favor of elected politicians," spokeswoman Taryn Fenske said in a statement. "This ruling was made with incoherent justifications, not based in science and facts — frankly not even remotely focused on the merits of the case presented.""It’s not surprising that Judge Cooper would rule against parents' rights and their ability to make the best educational and medical decisions for their family."Amy Nell, who lives in the Tampa area and was one of the parents to sue, said Cooper’s ruling made her feel heard for the first time in a while."Since the beginning of the school year it has felt like bizarro world," she said. "We are being told that science — what we think it is and everything we know about viruses — may be not true." Her son is in elementary school.Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis speaks in Pembroke Pines, Florida, Aug. 18, 2021. (Associated Press)Cooper also noted that two Florida Supreme Court decisions from 1914 and 1939 found that individual rights are limited by their impact on the rights of others. For example, he said, adults have the right to drink alcohol but not to drive drunk, because that endangers others. There is a right to free speech, but not to harass or threaten others or yell "fire" in a crowded theater, he said.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPIn that same vein, he said, school boards can reasonably argue that maskless students endanger the health of other students and teachers.The delta variant caused the virus to resurge in the state over the summer with record highs for new cases.The Associated Press contributed to this report.Get all the stories you need-to-know from the most powerful name in news delivered first thing every morning to your inboxSubscribedYou've successfully subscribed to this newsletter!This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2022 FOX News Network, LLC.

Cuomo had reported to the public as of Monday, his last day in office."We’re now releasing more data than had been released before publicly, so people know the nursing home deaths and the hospital deaths are consistent with what’s being displayed by the CDC," Hochul said Wednesday on MSNBC. "There’s a lot of things that weren’t happening and I’m going to make them happen. Transparency will be the hallmark of my administration."New York Gov. Kathy Hochul speaks to reporters after a ceremonial swearing-in ceremony at the state Capitol, Tuesday, Aug. 24, 2021, in Albany, N.Y.(AP Photo)KATHY HOCHUL BECOMES NEW YORK’S FIRST FEMALE GOVERNORThe Associated Press first reported in July on the large discrepancy between the fatality numbers publicized by the Cuomo administration and numbers the state was reporting to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The count used by Cuomo in his news media briefings only included laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 deaths reported through a state system that collects data from hospitals, nursing homes and adult care facilities. That meant the tally excluded people who died at home, hospice, in state prisons or at state-run homes for people living with disabilities. It also excluded people who likely died of COVID-19 but never got a positive test to confirm the diagnosis.That lower number favored by the Cuomo administration still appeared in the daily update put out by Hochul’s office Tuesday, but with an explanation about why it was an incomplete count."There are presumed and confirmed deaths. People should know both," Hochul said in a Wednesday morning appearance on NPR. "Also, as of yesterday, we’re using CDC numbers, which will be consistent. And so there’s no opportunity for us to mask those numbers, nor do I want to mask those numbers. The public deserves a clear, honest picture of what’s happening. And that’s whether it’s good or bad, they need to know the truth. And that’s how we restore confidence."KATHY HOCHUL TIES RECORD, BECOMES NINTH FEMALE GOVERNORCuomo's critics had long charged that he was manipulating coronavirus statics to burnish his image as a pandemic leader.Federal prosecutors previously launched a probe examining his administration's handling of data around deaths among nursing home patients. The state, under Cuomo, had minimized its toll of nursing home residents’ deaths by excluding all patients who died after being transferred to hospitals.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPCuomo used those lower numbers last year to erroneously claim that New York was seeing a much smaller percentage of nursing home residents dying of COVID-19 than other states.The state Assembly Judiciary committee has also been investigating that issue as part of a wide-ranging impeachment probe, and is weighing whether to include those findings in a public report.Get all the stories you need-to-know from the most powerful name in news delivered first thing every morning to your inboxSubscribedYou've successfully subscribed to this newsletter!This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2022 FOX News Network, LLC.

The announcement of the previous deadline noted that the date could be moved up if a vaccine were to get FDA approval, and the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine received that approval earlier this week.WASHINGTON PUBLIC SCHOOL REQUIRES STUDENT ATHLETES TO WEAR TRACKING MONITORS TO TRACE COVID"To defend this Nation, we need a healthy and ready force," Austin said in a memo. "After careful consultation with medical experts and military leadership, and with the support of the President, I have determined that mandatory vaccination against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is necessary to protect the Force and defend the American people."Austin directed the secretaries of the various military departments to have all Armed Forces members on active duty and in the ready reserves, including the National Guard, vaccinated if they have not already received their shots.PENTAGON'S KIRBY ASKED IF HE'S BEING ‘DELIBERATELY VAGUE’ ON NUMBER OF AMERICANS IN AFGHANISTANWhile any of the vaccines that the FDA has permitted under Emergency Use Authorizations are acceptable, the Pentagon will only require people to get vaccinated using an FDA-approved vaccine. So far, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is the only one to get full FDA approval.The memo encouraged the military secretaries to "impose ambitious timelines" to complete the vaccination process.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPAt a briefing Wednesday, Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby indicated that exceptions will be made for service members who have a religious objection, or who have a health condition such that a doctor advises them not to get the vaccine. Kirby said that anyone refusing the vaccine outside of those two exceptions would need to speak with a physician and their commanding officer to talk about the risks, but he declined to say if they would face discipline under the Uniform Code of Military Justice."It's a lawful order," Kirby said. "And we fully anticipate that our troops are going to follow lawful orders. When you raise your right hand and and you take that oath, that's what you agree to do."The Uniform Code of Military Justicedirectsthat anyone who fails to obey a lawful order "shall be punished as a court-martial may direct," though Kirby indicated that commanders would use "plenty of other tools" to persuade service members "short of having to use disciplinary action."Sixty-eight percent of the military is fully vaccinated, and 76% have received at least one dose, Kirby said Wednesday.But some branches have seen more vaccinations than others. In the Navy, 73% are fully vaccinated while 40% of the Army are fully vaccinated. The Marine Corps has a 53% vaccination rate, and the Air Force 57%.President Bidenendorsed the idea of a vaccine mandate in a statement issued earlier this month following Austin's initial mandate announcement."I strongly support Secretary Austin’s message to the Force today on the Department of Defense’s plan to add the COVID-19 vaccine to the list of required vaccinations for our service members not later than mid-September," Biden said. "Secretary Austin and I share an unshakable commitment to making sure our troops have every tool they need to do their jobs as safely as possible."Lucas Y.

"Additionally, forcing schoolchildren to mask all day could hinder critical development by eliminating facial cues and expressions."DESANTIS, ABBOTT SCHOOL MASK RULES IN LINE WITH MANY FOREIGN COUNTRIES"We filed this suit today because we fundamentally don’t believe in forced masking, rather that parents and families should have the power to make decisions on masks, based on science and facts," he continued.

Americans are free people, not subjects."Schmitt’s lawsuitlists Columbia Public Schools, the district's superintendent and its board of education and members as defendants. It comes two days after dozens of Columbia Public School parents protested outside the school district’s administration building demanding an end to its mask requirement for the new school year, which started Tuesday.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThe lawsuit argues that school mask mandates are not grounded in science and that they can actually be detrimental to the development of young children.

Andrew Cuomo, who officially resigned from the post on Monday amid sexual harassment allegations, sent one final message to New Yorkers on an alert system he used regularly during the COVID-19 pandemic.Those who had signed up for alerts from the state received the email, which the governor regularly used to deliver updates about the pandemic."We didn’t get everything done we wanted to, and we didn’t always get it quite right, but I want you to know, from the bottom of my heart, that every day I worked my hardest, I gave it my all, to deliver for you," Cuomo wrote.He posted the same message on Twitter.Cuomo touted some of the successes achieved during his nearly three-year tenure, including passing Marriage Equality and establishing a $15 minimum wage.CUOMO CALLS AG PROBE 'POLITICAL FIRECRACKER,' TAKES SHOTS AT FAR-LEFT DEMS IN FAREWELL ADDRESSEarlier in the day, Cuomo delivered his final public address, in which he maintained innocence and cast doubt on a report that found he sexually harassed multiple women.Cuomo will be succeeded by Lieutenant Gov.

Ron DeSantis criticizes the president's handle on foreign relations.Republican governors like Florida’sRon DeSantisand Texas’Greg Abbottare getting slammed by Democrats and media personalities for their opposition toCOVID-19masking in schools, despite taking an approach that falls in line with many nations across the globe.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention currently recommends universal indoor masking by all students ages 2 and older. While many states and school districts have followed the CDC’s guidance by instituting mask mandates in schools, DeSantis issued an executive order allowing parents to opt their children out.FLORIDA SCHOOL BOARD DEFIES DESANTIS, SETS 90-DAY MASK POLICY AFTER HEATED MEETINGAbbott, meanwhile, has banned mask mandates by any government entity, though enforcement of the ban is currently paused because of ongoing court challenges.The oppositional approach to mask mandates by the Republican governors has earned them scorn and derision by the media and the Democratic Party, who argue their policies have prolonged the COVID-19 pandemic. President Biden accused Abbott of "Neanderthal thinking" for lifting his mask mandate in March and he routinely battles DeSantis over his handling of the pandemic, telling him earlier this month to "get out of the way" of local mandates.But contrary to the CDC, manyEuropeanand developed countries have decided against recommending masks for young children in schools or other public settings.The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, an agency of the European Union, does not recommend masks for children 6 and under in any setting or for children 12 and under in a classroom setting. In the Republic of Ireland, children ages 13 and younger are only advised to wear a mask if they attend middle school. In Sweden, children have never been told to wear masks in school.In Iceland, children ages 15 and younger are exempt from mask requirements. In Norway, schoolchildren 7 and younger are not required to wear masks. When it comes to the U.K., which is reporting a similar COVID-19 surge as the U.S., public health officials in England and Wales are no longer recommending masks in classrooms starting this September. In Scotland, children 12 and under are no longer required to wear face coverings in public places. And officials in Northern Ireland have indicated they plan to drop masking requirements in schools this fall.In New Zealand, masks are not recommended in schools or for children younger than 6 in any public setting, but children or teachers who wish to wear them "may do so if they want to" and "should not be criticized for doing so," the country’s Ministry for Education website currently states.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPDeSantis' press secretary Christina Pushaw told Fox News in a statement that President Biden is focused on politicizing the pandemic in an effort to distract from the Afghanistan crisis."Governor DeSantis seeks the best advise and expertise from all over the world; his detractors simply accept the proclamations of the CDC as though they are infallible," Pushaw said. "However, the CDC’s guidance has flip-flopped many times, and U.S. public health authorities have lost the trust of the American people. In other countries, COVID-19 is not as politicized, so it makes sense that the EU is following a more data-driven, pro-child approach.

"Virginia is already struggling to recover from the pandemic due to failed Democratic leadership, and now Terry McAuliffe wants to 'make life difficult' for Virginians and businesses by issuing a government mandate that attempts to bully them into complying with what McAuliffe and the government thinks is best, and that will clearly evolve into closing down businesses and locking down Virginia again."Earlier Monday, the FDAgrantedfull approval to Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine for individuals 16 years and older, paving the way for the Pentagon to mandate the vaccine among 1.3 million active-duty service members.Jessica Chasmar is a reporter for Fox News Digital.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.TheKentuckygovernor’s efforts to aggressively combatCOVID-19suffered a landmark legal defeat Saturday as the state’s high court cleared the way for new laws to rein in his emergency powers.The stateSupreme Courtordered a lower court to dissolve an injunction that temporarily blocked the Republican-backed laws strictly limitingDemocraticGov. Andy Beshear’s emergency powers.The ruling revolved around a constitutional showdown between Beshear and the GOP-led legislature over the scope of the governor’s executive authority in emergencies. It comes as COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations are surging because of the highly contagious delta variant.The case stems from measures passed by the legislature this year to curb those emergency powers in response to Beshear’s aggressive handling of the coronavirus crisis. The governor immediately filed a lawsuit challenging the measures after his vetoes of the bills were overridden.TOM T. HALL, COUNTRY SINGER AND 'HARPER VALLEY P.T.A. COMPOSER, DEAD AT 85The Supreme Court said Saturday that the governor’s claims that the measures impaired his ability to carry out his constitutional duties were "largely unsupported by sound legal principles.""In sum, considering that the challenged legislation was lawfully passed, the governor’s complaint does not present a substantial legal question that would necessitate staying the effectiveness of the legislation," Justice Laurance B. VanMeter wrote.Republican lawmakers said the new laws were meant to put checks on what they viewed as Beshear’s overreach in ordering a series of restrictions to combat the virus’s spread. The governor maintained the steps he took to limit activity during the pandemic have saved lives.The governor lifted most of his pandemic restrictions in June. But with COVID-19 cases spiking due to the delta variant, he signed a recent executive order imposing an indoor mask mandate in K-12 schools, child care and pre-kindergarten programs across Kentucky.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPOne of the contested laws limits the governor’s executive orders in times of emergency to 30 days unless extended by lawmakers. Under another measure, businesses and schools have to comply either with COVID-19 guidelines from the governor or the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. They could follow whichever standard is least restrictive.Last year, the state Supreme Court upheld the governor’s authority to issue coronavirus-related restrictions on businesses and individuals to try to contain the spread of COVID-19.

Several other school districts have challenged the law with mask requirements but Sarasota is the first country formerPresident Trumpwon in 2020 to do so, FOX 13 of Tampa reported.During the five-hour meeting, residents and parents decried the district’s "medical tyranny" and said they were "disgusted" and "mad as heck" over a mask mandate, Politico reported.The meeting had to be paused several times due to outbursts from attendees and some people were removed, according to Sarasota Magazine."So what this is, is it’s literally putting fear in our children and this is stuff that kids cannot overcome," parent Heather Huddleston told FOX 13 while demonstrating against masks outside of the meeting.TEXAS SCHOOLS CAN MANDATE MASKS IN DEFIANCE OF GOV. ABBOTT'S EXECUTIVE ORDER PENDING LEGAL CHALLENGESThe only exceptions to the mandate will be a medical exemption or an Individual Education Program and employees and visitors will also be required to wear a mask. The board was voting on three options - all of which involved a mask mandate.The state has threatened to withhold school board salaries for defiant counties but the Biden administration has offered federal financial assistance to districts requiring masks, according toPolitico.Florida Gov.

Ron Johnson and Sen. Rand Paul are accusing the HHS of stonewalling on the origin of the coronavirus and have sent multiple letters requesting documents.On Thursday, Johnson sent a letter to Becerra following up on aprevious letterfrom June requesting emails between health officials and scientists related to a Wuhan lab that received United States research funding.WUHAN LAB REPORT RAISES FURTHER QUESTIONS ABOUT POSSIBLE COVID-19 LAB LEAKJohnson told Fox News that the U.S. government provided 200 pages of documents, but the redactions made it impossible to gather proper context."They do not feel like they have to be honest with Congress and transparent with the American public," Johnson told Fox News. "They release information that’s so fully redacted you really can’t use it for legitimate oversight."In the August 19 letter, Johnson asks Becerra for unredacted documents from National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases official Ping Chen concerning her report on a visit to the Wuhan Institute of Virology."Based on other documents in our possession, including a January 19, 2018 State Department cable regarding safety concerns at the WIV, we are concerned that HHS has redacted important information potentially relating to these safety issues," the letter says.HANNITY: DR. FAUCI SHOULD BE FIRED, HE'S BEEN WRONG TOO OFTENThe letter says that based on some correspondences from April 2020 that have been made public, "it appears that Chen’s November 2017 report partially served as the basis for the January 2018 cable that raised safety concerns about the Wuhan lab."The letter continues, "However, because of HHS’s redactions and incomplete document production, it is unclear whether Chen raised similar safety concerns to her colleagues in the enclosed email chain regarding her trip to the Wuhan lab. If Chen did raise safety concerns about the Wuhan lab to NIAID and National Institutes of Health officials as early as November 2017, it is unclear what actions, if any, those officials took."The letter calls for a "complete unredacted copy of Ping Chen’s 2017 report" and "all unredacted communications referring or relating to her report."The fact that we’re not getting this information, to me, just smacks of a cover-up," Johnson said. "Why is it the NIH, HHS, NIAID, the organization that Fauci has, why aren't they being completely transparent? What do they have to cover up?"Johnson called on Senate Homeland Security & Governmental Affairs Committee Chairman Gary Peters, a Democrat,  to utilize the committee’s subpoena power to look at the information on a "bipartisan basis."GOP REPS SEEK ANSWERS FROM FAUCI ON WHETHER HE MISLED AMERICANS ON GAIN-OF-FUNCTION RESEARCH IN CHINA"Particularly the Anthony Fauci emails, those occurred during a previous administration, a Republican administration, those are information on gain of function," Johnson added. "What do NIAID know about the lack of protocols and safety at a bio lab that they were funding research at? What do they know and when did they know it?""That’s information the American government needs to know about what certain government agencies are doing, particularly involving something as dangerous as gain of function research," Johnson said.As the lab-leak theory hasgained credibilityafter being widelydismissed in the presslast year, there's more attention being paid to monies given to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, known for its bat coronavirus research and so-called "gain of function" methods, which involves manipulating viruses to make them more infectious for research.Republicans on the House side have also been trying to press the federal government for answers involving gain of function research at the Wuhan lab that many believe was the site where the coronavirus originated.Last month, Reps. Chip Roy, R-Texas, and Bill Posey, R-Fla., led a letter – first obtained by Fox News – to the nation's top infectious disease expert in which they accuse him of appearing to "mislead the American people on the origins of COVID-19 and gain-of-function research."WHO SAYS COVID-19 ORIGIN NEEDS MORE STUDIES AS TOP EXPERT'S LAB 'CONCERN' MADE PUBLIC FOR FIRST TIME"He testified before the Senate that risky gain-of-function research was not occurring in Wuhan, yet in his now-public emails, sends an urgent message to his deputy on gain-of-function," Roy told Fox News Wednesday. "His emails also implicate him in having influence over a paper that called the lab leak theory implausible."The American people deserve answers about what Fauci knew and when he knew it; we must investigate this and see wherever the truth leads us."The group of 13 lawmakers fired off a series of specific questions to Fauci about his emails, which were recently published by news outlets thanks to Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests. They suggest that Fauci's email communications contradict his public statements that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) did not fund so-called "gain-of-function" research at a Wuhan virology lab.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPFauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has repeatedly denied any NIH money went to such research in Wuhan, but his organization has givenmillions of dollarsin grant money to the EcoHealth Alliance, a research nonprofit that funneled at least $600,000 to Wuhan coronavirus research.Marisa Schultz contributed to this reportAndrew Mark Miller is a writer at Fox News.

"Not only do they all share one thing in common, their support for Trump. But they also support eliminating mask mandates in our public schools, eliminating vaccine verifications.""The leading candidate Larry Elder says he'll do that day one," he continued. "So, I have no interest in taking us off the COVID cliff."NEWSOM RECALL: LARRY ELDER SAYS HE WILL REPEAL MASK, VACCINE MANDATES IF HE WINS ELECTIONThe interview comes as Newsom continues ramping up his campaign to hold onto the governorship as the Sept. 14 recall election looms.He has long been criticized for his handling of the pandemic, with recall challengers such as Larry Elder slamming him for decimating businesses and requiring students wear masks in the classroom.Newsom, however, defended how he reopened schools in the state, saying the pandemic was "difficult times.""You have to remind yourself.

"We got a majority of schools to reopen by the end of the school year."GAVIN NEWSOM SLAMMED FOR MASK 'HYPOCRISY' AND 'IGNORING SCIENCE' BY GOP GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE LARRY ELDER"Look, it's a difficult job balancing, managing the needs, desires, aspirations of 40 million Americans," he added when pressed for specifics on any mistakes he may have made during the pandemic. "But I'm very proud of what we've done on COVID. It's been challenging, it's been stressful, but I think it's important … our approach of being the first to lead with the stay at home order, I believe saved lives."He also said that former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who became governor of the state in 2003 after a recall election, has advised him ahead of the Sept. 14 vote."I appreciate his advice and counsel," he said of Schwarzenegger. "All the former governors have been very helpful throughout this pandemic."Elder, meanwhile, has vowed to do away vaccine and face mask mandates if he is elected governor."This man that I'm going to defeat on September 14, he shut down the state in the most severe way than any of the other 49 governors have," Elder told an audience in a San Jose church last week. "When I get elected, assuming there are still face mask mandates and vaccine mandates, they will be repealed right away and then I'll break for breakfast."ELDER FORCEFULLY DENIES BRANDISHING WEAPON ON EX-FIANCEE: 'POLITICS OF PERSONAL DESTRUCTION'The embattled governor held his first official campaign event last week, where he warned voters to vote "no" on recall ballots and said that Elder is more right-wing than former PresidentDonald Trump."He's to the right of Donald Trump. To the right of Donald Trump. That's what's at stake in this election and don't think for a second you can't do damage in that role. Think about the judges he could appoint. Who would he have appointed to replace Kamala Harris in the U.S. Senate? How would that impact the trajectory of this country. What would this mean for the future of the Democratic party in our efforts to keep the House of Representatives,"Newsom said last Friday in San Francisco.The ballots began shipping out to voters this week, and ask who of the 46 candidates should replace Newsom."Just vote no. You don't even have to touch the other part. The other part is irrelevant. Don't even touch it. Simple no. This is about the easiest ballot you ever had to fill out. Just vote no.

Andrew Cuomo next week, said in an appearance on CBS’ "Face the Nation." "What I have done already is met with the commissioner of health and we will be talking about what outstanding requests for data are in the realm. I will look at those and have my team focus on that early on.""I have to tell ya, on Day 1, I am focused on COVID," Hochul, a Democrat, continued. "We have to deal with the fact that the rates are rising. I want to get money out to people. We have way too much money sitting there that should be going to renters, the landlords who are suffering. And I also want to get the money out for the excluded worker program where people who are immigrants aren’t getting any money because they aren’t documented and that money is sitting there unspent."CUOMO SUCCESSOR KATHY HOCHUL SAYS 14-DAY TRANSTION PERIOD ‘NOT WHAT I ASKED FOR’"So I have a lot of priorities, but I will absolutely make sure that my administration fully cooperates with these requests for data," she said.Cuomo announced last week that he will resign on Aug. 24, giving himself a two-week transition period following a scathing report from New York Attorney Letitia James that concluded he had sexually harassed multiple women. Hochul, a Democrat, will replace him on that date.She has said she intends to run for reelection in her own right next year.The Cuomo administration severely undercounted nursing home deaths after the governor ordered long-term care facilities to accept positive coronavirus patients in the early stages of the pandemic. Cuomo officials also reportedly altered a report on nursing home deaths to obscure the fact that the administration was undercounting such deaths.The governor has also faced scrutiny for granting immunity to nursing home executives from coronavirus-related lawsuits. The immunity for the nursing home execs followed a large donation to Cuomo's campaign from a high-powered health care industry group. Cuomo has repeatedly denied wrongdoing in the nursing home saga.Meanwhile, New York State Assemblyman Ron Kim has called for Hochul to release email records in order to prove that she was not aware of Cuomo’s alleged sexual misconduct."It's hard to prove a negative because I've had no communication along those lines. But I believe in transparency and we’ll evaluate all of those requests," Hochul said Sunday. "But it is no secret that the governor and I were not close. But I did support the legacy of progressive accomplishments which are outstanding, and my role as lieutenant governor is not to be in those rooms or spend much time in the capital – but to really be out speaking to New Yorkers and championing issues like childcare, paid family leave and higher wages. And I’m going to continue doing that."CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPHochul said she knows Cuomo’s accusers "feel welcome to stay in the administration if they are here.""I want them to know the culture will be changed 1,000%," she said. "I want every young woman, just like I was a high school assembly intern, to realize that this is a place where they have a role. We need their voices, we need that diversity. We’re getting there. We’re making progress on more elected women, but I want by the end of my administration for every woman to say there are no barriers."Fox News’ Andrew Mark Miller contributed to this report.Danielle Wallace is a reporter for Fox News Digital covering politics, crime, police and more.

Students who don’t comply will have their registration canceled, and employees who don’t comply will lose their jobs.A three-judge federal appeals court panel, including two judges appointed by former President Donald Trump, was one of two lower courts to side with Indiana University and allow it to require vaccinations. The plan announced in May requires roughly 90,000 students and 40,000 employees on seven campuses to receive COVID-19 vaccinations for the fall semester.In July, an Indiana district court judgesided with the universityin declining to issue a preliminary injunction blocking the vaccine mandate.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.As left-leaningagendasare descending ontoschool districtsacross the country, they're being met with intense resistance from parents concerned about the impact on children.For the past few months, the country has seen protests and charged public meetings with comments opposed tocritical race theory, masking rules and gender-related policies.On Wednesday, the Loudoun County School Board inVirginiaapproved a gender-related policy with provisions that had been inspiring conflict for months within the county.Policy 8040, which the school board overwhelminglyapproved, requiresteachersto use preferred pronouns and allows "gender-expansive and transgender students" to participate in sports and other activities "in a manner consistent with the student’s gender identity."VIRGINIA SCHOOL BOARD SEES CONTENTIOUS, EMOTIONAL MEETING AS IT WEIGHS GENDER-RELATED POLICIESNatassia Grover lambasted what she called the board's "relentless onslaught against girls," taking special aim at fathers on the school board."I am so shocked there are fathers on this school board who support Policy 8040. As a father, you are in a role that is supposed to be protective of children's privacy, modesty and safety," she said."The tiny minority of students who do not feel comfortable or safe in spaces with people of the same sex should be accommodated with a third neutral space rather than violating the basic rights of the majority of students."The issue came to a head in May when one teacher objected to the policy – prompting his dismissal and an ongoing legal battle.But even before that, Loudoun was one of the most prominent school districts with parents fighting back against CRT. Amid their fight, several other localities saw parents revolt.Nicole Solas, a mother inRhode Island, has been sued in response to copious public records requests she made in relation to CRT in her district.CRITICAL RACE THEORY: DIVERSE GROUP OF MOTHERS FROM ACROSS THE COUNTRY SPEAK OUTAs students return to school, they'll also have to deal with various public health requirements for combating the coronavirus. Earlier this week, a school board member in Oklahoma went so far as to say kids could "commit murder" by not wearing masks. She later apologized, but her comment seemed to reflect ongoing tension over one of the most hot-button topics of the pandemic.InTennessee, parents reportedly argued that schools didn't have the power to mandate whether their children wore masks. "Parents should be allowed to choose what they want and how their children go to school," said parent David Grimmett, according toNBC News.OKLAHOMA SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER APOLOGIZES AFTER COMMENTS ABOUT MASKLESS STUDENTSRankin County,Mississippi,similarly saw backlash as it decided to implement a new mask mandate. "The choice belongs to the parent and legal guardians. As a parent I make the medical decisions for my children, not the school district," Kassie Wilsonreportedly said.Parents have also supported these various initiatives. For example, one Loudoun commenter, who identified as Charlotte McConnell, spoke in support of provisions like 8040. As she spoke, she held up a sign that read: "We can disagree and still love each other, unless your disagreement is rooted in my oppression and denial of my humanity and right to exist."CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPMcConnell claimed to have been abused multiple times, but by "straight, White men."Sam Dorman is a reporter with Fox News.

Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney announced Wednesday that the city is implementing an indoor mask mandate effective Thursday. Oregon Gov. Kate Brown announced a mask mandate Wednesday to take effect Friday."Masks are simple and they are effective. Wearing a mask should give you confidence that you are not infecting others," Brown said at a Wednesday press conference. "Masks are also our best bet at keeping our schools and our businesses open.""The pandemic is far from over. It's a disappointing reminder that we still have dark days ahead. Until more people get vaccinated, we are all still in danger," she said.TEXAS GOV. ABBOTT SAYS THOSE WHO DEFY ORDER BARRING MASK MANDATES WILL ‘BE TAKEN TO COURT’People who are vaccinated are almost certainly not in danger from COVID-19. The coronavirus vaccines are extremely effective at preventing nearly all severe illness, hospitalization and death, even in the case of "breakthrough" infections. In the vast majority of states, vaccinated people make up less than 1% of hospitalized coronavirus patients, according to theNew York Times.Brown said part of the reason she decided to implement a mask mandate was out of exasperation with local officials who wouldn't. Multnomah County, where Portland is, imposed a mandate that is also effective Friday. But, Brown said, "for the most part local elected officials were not willing to make the tough decisions."Kenney expressed his own kind of exasperation Wednesday, but at individual citizens rather than other officials. He said people who aren't getting vaccinated are to blame for his mask mandate decision."I'm upset that people just can't act in the way they're supposed to act and do what's good for everybody," he said, regarding vaccinations. "This amazes me that this is the most simple thing to do… and people still refuse to do it… it's a shame."DALLAS SCHOOLS ISSUE MASK MANDATE, DEFYING GOV. ABBOTT’S EXECUTIVE ORDERKenney further said that any future lockdowns in his city would also be the fault of the unvaccinated."Not if everybody acts like a mature adult and does what they're supposed to do, we don't anticipate a lockdown," he said. "People just have to grow up and do what they're supposed to do."Philadelphia also imposed a requirement on city employees that they either get vaccinated or will be forced to wear two masks while at work.California Gov. Gavin Newsom speaks with reporters at Carl B. Munck Elementary School, Wednesday, Aug. 11, 2021, in Oakland, Calif. (Santiago Mejia/San Francisco Chronicle via AP, Pool)(Santiago Mejia/San Francisco Chronicle via AP, Pool)Oregon joined Hawaii and Louisiana as states with mask mandates regardless of vaccination. Philadelphia joins several major cities that have already reinstituted indoor mask mandates, including Washington, D.C.; Atlanta; Berkeley, California; Kansas City, Missouri; Los Angeles, and Minneapolis.Other cities that brought back mask mandates in the past week include Little Rock, Arkansas, and Baltimore, Maryland."This pandemic is not over and we must all do our due diligence to protect ourselves and our neighbors," Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott said last week.Baltimore Health Commissioner Letitia Dzirasa added that the delta variant "poses a serious threat to our unvaccinated residents.""I’m speaking to you not just as the health commissioner but as a mother of a child that is too young to be vaccinated," she said.AMID COVID SURGE, SCHOOL MASK MANDATES APPROVED BY MOST PARENTS: POLLThe coronavirus, however, does not pose a serious threat to unvaccinated young children. In fact, in the final two weeks of July, only 3.5% and 3.2% of patients hospitalized with the coronavirus were under age 17, according toCDCdata. The majority of COVID-19 patients in hospitals are still over 50 and nearly all of such patients are not vaccinated.Another place with a new mask mandate is Danbury, Connecticut. Beginning Aug. 15, that city will require "all individuals… to wear masks or cloth face coverings at all times while in public indoor settings, regardless of vaccination status."These city and statewide mask mandates are in addition to the increasingly common – and very controversial – school mask mandates being ordered for both universities and primary schools.Princeton announced an indoor mask mandate on Wednesday, according toThe Daily Princetonian.Penn Stateannounced a similar mandate earlier this month.Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, a Democrat, joined many other governors this week in requiring masks in schools – a decision that prompted one school superintendent to call him a "liberal lunatic," according to theLouisville Courier Journal.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThere are still many places around the country that aren't mandating masks, however. Those are mainly red states and cities, especially places like Florida and Texas.Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, for example, signed an executive order banning mask mandates. And Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said that he will vigorously defend that order from any court challenges.But some Democratic areas are also reluctant to implement mask mandates – most notably Boston and New York City. Boston Mayor Kim Janey is vigorously resisting vaccine mandates and is strongly encouraging citizens to wear masks, according to theBoston Herald. But she is not mandating them anywhere but schools.New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, conversely, has embraced vaccine mandates. But like Janey, he has been cool to the idea of blanket mask mandates. De Blasio has said the vaccine is a much more powerful tool to fight the coronavirus than a mask.Tyler Olson covers politics for Fox News Digital.

"We've had 615,000-plus deaths, and we are in a major surge now as we're going into the fall, into the school season. This is very serious business."AUSTIN AND DALLAS SCHOOLS IMPLEMENT NEW MASK MANDATES, CONTRAVENING GOV. ABBOTT'S BANDespite warnings from President Biden that the U.S. could see increased mandates with the rise in delta variant-positive cases, Fauci said the directives will not come from the federal level.The director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said the orders would come from state leaders instead.Fauci suggested he thinks statewide mandates will become increasingly likely after the Food and Drug Administration gives its stamp of approval to the vaccine.Biden said the vaccine’s FDA approval is expected sometime this fall, though the administration has yet to home in more precisely on when the U.S. can expect the federal green light."There's no doubt that these vaccines are going to get fully approved," Fauci said. "This idea about, 'It's not fully approved,' is really a false narrative. It really is. I mean, you should consider this as good as fully approved and get vaccinated."Children ages two through 12 have not been approved to receive the coronavirus vaccine – a hurdle that has become ever more urgent with the more contagious delta variant.The number of reported cases of children contracting the virus increased by four percent last week according to data from the American Academy of Pediatrics with nearly 94,000 newly confirmed cases.FAUCI SAYS 'HOPEFULLY' MAKING YOUNG KIDS WEAR MASKS WON'T HAVE 'LASTING NEGATIVE IMPACT'Fauci said he thinks it is necessary for children and adults to don masks while at school."It's not comfortable, obviously, for children to wear masks, particularly the younger children," he told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt Monday. "This virus not only is so extraordinarily transmissible, but we're starting to see pediatric hospitals get more and more younger people and kids not only numerically, but what seems to be more severe disease."Parents who oppose their kids wearing masks argue it is impeding their social and cognitive abilities because masks hide an individual’s expression.Fauci said the Centers for Disease and Prevention (CDC) were attempting to "balance" the potential threat delta poses to children and adults.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP"But hopefully, this will be a temporary thing, temporary enough that it doesn't have any lasting negative impact on them," he added.The CDC reported a daily average of nearly 90,000 new cases last week, a near 34 percent increase from the week prior.Jessica Chasmar contributed to this report.Get all the stories you need-to-know from the most powerful name in news delivered first thing every morning to your inboxSubscribedYou've successfully subscribed to this newsletter!This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2022 FOX News Network, LLC.

We’re checking that,"Biden said Tuesdaywhen asked if he could intervene in states such as Texas and Florida that have banned mask mandates. "But there are — federal workforce, I can."Biden's remarks came after he addressed the issue of states that have banned public schools districts from imposing mask mandates for the upcoming school year. The presidentcalled such efforts "disingenuous," arguing governors should allow districts to follow Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines."And I find it interesting that some of the very people who are saying that, who hold government positions, are people who are threatening that if a schoolteacher asks a student if they have been vaccinated, or if a principal says that ‘everyone in my school should wear a mask’ or the school board votes for it, that governor will nullify that — that governor has the authority to say, ‘You can’t do that,’" Biden said."I find that totally counterintuitive and, quite frankly, disingenuous," he added.Although Biden didn't single out any specific governor by name, the president has recently been embroiled in a war of words withFlorida Gov.

Lisa McClain and GOP members demand to know why DOJ won't investigate Michigan coronavirus nursing home deaths.Hours after New York Gov.Andrew Cuomoannounced his intention to resign, U.S. House Minority WhipSteve Scalise, R-La., demanded that the governor releaseCOVID-19nursing home data to the public before he leaves office.In January, New York's Democratic Attorney General Letitia Jamesreleased a reportshowing that the state's Department of Health under Cuomo had undercounted COVID-19 deaths in nursing homes after the governororderednursing homes to accept patients who had tested positive for the disease. Cuomo had received an Emmy award for his COVID-19 briefings and wrote a book about his leadership during the pandemic."Governor Cuomo’s predatory behavior has traumatized countless women, and his disastrous leadership during the COVID-19 pandemic led to the deaths of thousands of senior citizens in nursing homes," Scalise said in a statement on Tuesday after Cuomoannouncedhis resignation. "For too long, Democrats and the mainstream media fawned over Cuomo, made excuses for Cuomo, and enabled Cuomo, despite overwhelming evidence."NY GOV. CUOMO RESIGNS AMID SEXUAL HARASSMENT SCANDAL"Now that he is finally resigning, it is long overdue for Governor Cuomo to end the coverup and be transparent by releasing the data from his deadly mandate that nursing homes take COVID-positive patients, which led to the untimely deaths of thousands of seniors. All those families who lost loved ones deserve answers and the ability to seek closure," Scalise added.Scalise called on Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul, who will serve the remainder of Cuomo's term, to release the information herself, should Cuomo fail to do so."If Governor Cuomo refuses to release this data, then Lieutenant Governor Kathy Hochul must do the right thing and end the coverup by making this nursing home information public when she takes the oath as governor," Scalise concluded. "Grieving families across the Empire State deserve answers about the real reason why so many seniors died of COVID-19 in nursing homes and long-term care facilities."Last year, House Republicans on the Select Committee on the Coronavirus Crisissent five lettersto governors who ordered nursing homes to admit COVID-positive patients, including Cuomo.The Republicans claimed that such orders contrasted with guidance issued by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. CMS guidance explicitly did "not direct any nursing home to accept a COVID-19 positive patient, if they are unable to do so safely." Indeed, the guidance urged that "nursing homes should admit any individual that they would normally admit to their facility, including individuals from hospitals where a case of COVID-19 was/is present" only if the nursing home can follow CDC guidance.CMS Administrator Seema Verma also warned, "Under no circumstances should a hospital discharge a patient to a nursing home that is not prepared to take care of those patients’ needs."CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThe Department of Justice under President Trump opened an investigation into whether or not governors like Cuomo violated the civil rights of institutionalized persons by ordering nursing homes to admit COVID-positive patients. Last month, the DOJ under Preisdent Bidenannouncedit would not pursue the investigation."It is outrageous that the Department of Justice refuses to investigate the deadly ‘must admit’ orders issued by governors in New York, Pennsylvania and Michigan that resulted in the deaths of thousands of senior citizens," Scalise said at the time. "Where is the justice for nursing home victims and their grieving families?"Tyler O'Neil is an editor at Fox News. On Twitter:@Tyler2ONeil.

Kevin Stitt, who isreportedly refusingto allow mask mandates for schoolchildren. In May, he passed a law prohibiting school districts from imposing mandates unless the governor has at least declared a state of emergency that's in effect for their area."I would like to try to find a way to stand up as a district," Sexton said, "and get our surrounding superintendents to stand up with us, and protect our little kids.

"This is about personal responsibility, this is about freedoms," he said last month."Nothing in the legislation last year prevents a parent from sending their child to school with a mask on, or prevents anyone from having their child under 12 get vaccinated.

"If this is true, I call on your Department to cease these actions immediately."Brnovich was responding to a report in whicha Customs and Border Patrol union official warnedthat the U.S. was "releasing people out of the door day in and day out with actual positive tests for COVID and more keep popping up.""This is a stunning admission that has serious implication for border communities and states," Brnovich said of the report.BORDER PATROL UNION OFFICIAL WARNS COVID-POSITIVE MIGRANTS BEING RELEASED INTO US ‘DAY IN, DAY OUT’In addition to demanding a halt to the releasing of positive migrants, Brnovich sought an "accounting of COVID-positive people who have been released by Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents in Arizona sectors sincePresident Joe Bidenwas sworn into office."Chris Cabrera, a vice president of the National Border Patrol Council who made the revelations referenced by Brnovich, also warned that the situation has resulted in several agents getting sick with COVID-19."We have a lot of agents quarantined right now, which adds to our problem, on top of agents who are sick with COVID, so we’re concerned about catching it ourselves, we’re concerned about our families and coworkers and it just seems everyone's turning a blind eye to it when we have a real situation down here," Cabrera said last month.In the letter, Brnovich argued that the current situation at the border has "compromised the security and safety of countless American communities."Since the start of the 2021 fiscal year, CBP has apprehended over 1.1 million migrants at our southern border," Brnovich said. "We also know that there are (at least) tens of thousands of migrants (or ‘gotaways’) who escape detection and blend into our communities.

"But you know, what we’re starting to see, Hugh, and I think it's going to unfold even more as the weeks go by, that this virus not only is so extraordinarily transmissible, but we're starting to see pediatric hospitals get more and more younger people and kids not only numerically, but what seems to be more severe disease."Now we're tracking that, the CDC is tracking that really very carefully, so it’s going to be a balance that we would feel very badly if we all of a sudden said OK, kids, don't wear masks, then you find out retrospectively that this virus in a very, very strange and unusual way is really hitting kids really hard," he continued. "But hopefully, this will be a temporary thing, temporary enough that it doesn't have any lasting negative impact on them."Hewitt pushed back, citingan editorial Sundayby The Wall Street Journal, titled, "The Case Against Masks for Children," which argues that long-term masking can cause physical and developmental issues in children and that there’s little evidence to back up a mandate."Facial expression are integral to human connection, particularly for younger children who are only learning how to signal fear, confusion and happiness," Hewitt said. "Covering a child's face mutes these nonverbal form of communications, can result in robotic and emotionless interaction. So, Doctor, what did you base it on? Why?"Dr. Faucirespondedby claiming the data cited in the editorial "dates back to the alpha variant, not necessarily all the most recent data on delta."CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP"Delta is different," he said. "We’d better go back and make sure those data are really solid the same way you’re asking me, and I will. I’ll go back to the CDC and make sure that the data that they’re talking about is really solid. So let’s do both. Let’s just check both those things out and make sure we’re really talking about apples and apples and not apples and oranges, and make sure we’re talking about transmissibility of delta as we’re seeing what it’s doing right now."So I’ll just keep an open mind," he added.Jessica Chasmar is a reporter for Fox News Digital.

The duel threats of Covid and climate change have collided to create a food crisis in 23 hot spots. Most of the hardest-hit countries are inAfrica, but nations closer to home, such as Haiti and others in Central America have been badly affected also. The war in Afghanistan continues to create an emergency there."We protect the most vulnerable with safety nets," says Beasely.

The contributions from American taxpayers far outstrip the mere $11 million in donations from China and $72 million fromRussiain 2020.Other nations are also pitching in.Qatar recently donated $100 million to help feed people in war-torn Yemen, which the United Nations considers the world's worst humanitarian crisis."Qatar's support, part of which will go to WFP, is critical for staving off famine in Yemen and will save millions of lives," said Beasley."I am very encouraged by this latest development in Qatar's partnership with WFP and my sincere thanks go to the government and people of Qatar for this much-need expression of solidarity."UNVACCINATED INDIVIDUALS TWICE AS LIKELY TO FACE COVID-19 REINFECTION: CDC STUDYThe WFP says it supports nearly 13 million people in Yemen with emergency food assistance and special foods to prevent malnutrition for more than 3 million mothers and children.

This money will go a long way in helping end the suffering in Yemen, which reinforces efforts for regional peace and security," the senators said in a joint statement.The U.S. Special Envoy for Yemen, Tim Lenderking, thanked the Amir and noted that "more funding is urgently needed."Other nations have also targeted their donations to support the WFP's programs in Yemen, including Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E.

"If deputy sheriffs are forced to vaccinate a percentage of them will retire early or seek employment elsewhere."STUDENTS ASK SUPREME COURT TO BLOCK INDIANA COLLEGE'S COVID VACCINE MANDATEThe post stated the majority of officers are vaccinated, but that the union believes that continuing to wear face masks should be sufficient for those who are not."Approximately 160 out 700 Deputy Sheriffs [that] are not vaccinated prefer to mask and test weekly instead of being vaccinated due to religious and other beliefs," the post continues. "Currently, the staffing at the SFSO is at the lowest it has ever been due to the past 9-month applicant testing restriction placed on the Sheriff's Office by the Mayor."The union added that the city "cannot afford" to lose and more deputy sheriffs and public safety will be negatively affected if officers step down because of a vaccine mandate.CNN FIRES THREE WORKERS FOR COMING TO WORK WITHOUT BEING VACCINATEDThe announcement from the union comes as San Francisco is experiencing asurgein shootings and assaults.Last month, the cityannouncedthat all public employees, roughly 35,000, must be vaccinated against the coronavirus by Sept. 15 or risk the possibility of being fired.Religious and medical exemptions are allowed, but those who claim them could still face "repercussions [that] go all the way up to termination," chief of policy for the city’s Department of Human Resources Mawuli Tugbenyoh said.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThis week, Los Angeles County took a similar step andmandatedall public employees be vaccinated by Oct. 1, but did not allow for religious or medical exemptions."With the coronavirus again raging, driven by the highly contagious Delta variant," Board of Supervisors Chair Hilda L.

Asa Hutchinsonsigned in April banning mask requirements by governmental entities. The ban was being challenged by two lawsuits, including one from an east Arkansas school district where more than 900 staff and students are quarantining because of a coronavirus outbreak.Fox ruled against the measure on multiple grounds, including the argument that it discriminated between public and private schools.The law "cannot be enforced in any shape, fashion or form" pending further court action, Fox said.DESANTIS SAYS HE'S OPPOSED TO MANDATORY VACCINES FOR HOSPITAL WORKERSFox issued the ruling hours after lawmakers adjourned a special session that Hutchinson had called to consider rolling back the ban for some schools. Hutchinson had said the change was needed to protect children under 12 who can't get vaccinated as the state's virus cases and hospitalizations skyrocket.Hutchinson faced heavy opposition from fellowRepublicans, who had been inundated with calls and messages from opponents of masks in schools.The governor, who has said he regretted signing the ban into law, said he agreed with Fox's decision but didn't plan to reimpose the statewide mask mandate he lifted in March. He also criticized lawmakers who opposed taking action, saying many of them had taken a "casual, if not cavalier, attitude" toward the state's COVID-19 crisis."What concerns me is many are simply listening to the loudest voices and not standing up with compassion, common sense and serious action," he told reporters.Hutchinson was named as a defendant in the lawsuit along with the state and legislative leaders. He left open the possibility of separately asking the state Supreme Court to uphold Fox's ruling when it's appealed.A House panel on Thursday rejected two measures that would have allowed some school districts to issue mask requirements.Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson prior to the start of the second day of the Republican National Convention on July 19, 2016 in Cleveland, Ohio.  (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)CNN FIRE THREE WORKERS FOR COMING TO WORK WITHOUT BEING VACCCINATEDThere had been growing calls to lift the ban before school starts statewide later this month. The Marion School District, one of the districts challenging the mandate ban, on Friday said 949 staff and students have had to quarantine since classes began last week because of a coronavirus outbreak. The district said 54 students and 11 staff have tested positive for COVID-19."I think we're going to come to really regret not taking action," Democratic Sen. Keith Ingram, the chamber's minority leader, said. "I just hope the consequences aren't fatal for children or staff or teachers in this state."Pediatricians and health officials have said masks in schools are needed to protect children, as the delta variant and Arkansas’ low vaccination rate fuels the state’s spiraling cases. The state on Monday reported its biggest one-day increase in COVID-19 hospitalizations since the pandemic began, and the Department of Health on Friday said only 28 intensive care unit beds were available in the state.Opponents of lifting the ban who testified before the Legislature repeatedly cited false and discredited claims about the virus, including a woman who falsely suggested COVID-19 doesn't exist."That's what's frustrating, is we're not making decisions on data, respected data," Democratic Rep. Denise Garner, who co-sponsored one of the proposals to lift the ban.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThe Republican sponsor of the mandate ban said he thinks the state needs to focus on other ways to address outbreaks in schools, such as leave for teachers who have to quarantine."What I don’t want is this false sense of security that masks seem to be providing because it’s an easy political tool," said Republican Sen. Trent Garner. "Let’s come up with the real solutions when this happens in our schools, and I think we’re woefully inadequate on that."The House and Senate on Friday gave final approval to the only other item on the session's agenda, legislation aimed at preventing the state from resuming supplemental unemployment insurance payments to 69,000 people in the state.A state judge last week ordered Arkansas to resume the payment, ruling that Hutchinson didn't appear to have the authority on his own to cut off the payments. Hutchinson was among more than two dozen GOP governors who ended their states' participation in the federally funded payments, which were scheduled to run through early September.Get all the stories you need-to-know from the most powerful name in news delivered first thing every morning to your inboxSubscribedYou've successfully subscribed to this newsletter!This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2022 FOX News Network, LLC.

The order applies to workers in hospitals, nursing homes, and other health care facilities."As we continue to see an increase in cases and hospitalizations due to the Delta variant of COVID-19, it’s important that we protect the vulnerable patients in these settings," CDPH Director and State Public Health Officer Tomás J. Aragón said. "Today’s action will also ensure that health care workers themselves are protected. Vaccines are how we end this pandemic."DESANTIS FIRES BACK AT BIDEN: 'EVERY COVID VARIANT ON THIS PLANET' IS COMING THROUGH HIS OPEN BORDERAccording to the executive order, workers need to receive their second dose or be fully vaccinated by Sept. 30. The state said it would offer limited exemptions for medical or religious reasons.Workers who qualified for those exemptions would have to submit to weekly or biweekly COVID-19 testing, depending on the facility. They would also be required to wear a medical-grade mask while on site.In a separate executive order, public health officials said health care facilities can only admit visitors who are fully vaccinated or have tested negative for COVID-19 within 72 hours of an indoor visit to a patient.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThe measures were announced roughly one week after embattled California Gov.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.White Housepress secretary Jen Psaki did not say Thursday whether theBidenadministration will require vaccines for migrants coming across thesouthern bordereven as she acknowledged that the administration is considering mandating vaccines for foreign travelers entering the United States.Psaki was asked repeatedly about the specifics of the administration's internal deliberation regarding requirements for international travelers. She did not go into specifics and said the U.S. is "not at that point" of relaxing travel rules "because of the delta variant." She did say mandating vaccines is "strongly under consideration."But Psaki dodged a question directly asking whether the administration would require migrants in the custody of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to get vaccinated as hundreds of thousands rush across the U.S. border every month. Thousands of them are being released into American cities."That's not what the CBP is doing," Psaki said of Customs and Border Protection (CBP) administering vaccines. "There are NGOs and other international organizations who are vaccinating migrants as they come across the border as they work in partnership with us. Certainly that helps keep a range of people safe in the country."White House press secretary Jen Psaki speaks during a press briefing at the White House, Wednesday, Aug. 4, 2021, in Washington. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)TEXAS BORDER CITY SAYS MORE THAN 7,000 COVID-POSITIVE MIGRANTS RELEASED SINCE FEBRUARY, 1,500 LAST WEEKThe Biden administration has come under fire for its handling of the migrant surge, which Republicans blame on the president's dovish comments on immigration when he was campaigning. The White House meanwhile blames the Trump administration for the current crisis, saying that it hollowed out DHS infrastructure to process incoming migrants during the past four years.The situation is only getting worse, according to Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas, whose district is on the southern border. He's been highly critical of the president's handling of the border and appeared at a lengthy press conference last week with Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.The pair suggested that President Biden name a new border czar, to replace the leadership of Vice President Kamala Harris on the issue. Her main focus has been on "root causes" of immigration rather than border security."You hear about safety concerns... People cross and they're walking through the streets and neighborhoods," Cuellar said. "And there have been lockdowns in schools because they're right at the border and people just come in through they're worried about their kids."CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP"The mayor of Laredo said 'We're still pretty safe, but I worry about where we're going to be as a community in the next six months,'" Graham said of a phone call he conducted with local leaders. "The police chief said the resources I have now are beyond my the problems that I'm having to deal with there, beyond the resources. But every passing day, it gets worse."The White House emphasizes that it hasn't rescinded Title 42, which is a a policy to expel many migrants at the border due to the pandemic implemented by former President Trump. It's also pointed to its work on expedited removal. But many migrants nevertheless are being allowed to walk free in the United States."Since mid-February of 2021 there have been over 7,000 confirmed COVID-19 positive immigrants released into the city of McAllen by [Customs and Border Protection], including over 1,500 new cases in the past seven days," a statement released by the city of McAllen, Texas this week.Fox News' Adam Shaw contributed to this report.Tyler Olson covers politics for Fox News Digital.

Some apply equally to everyone; no one can carry weapons through the TSA checkpoint," Kayyem wrote. "But other protocols divide passengers into categories according to how much of a threat the government thinks they pose. If you submit to heightened scrutiny in advance, TSA PreCheck lets you go through security without taking off your shoes; a no-fly list keeps certain people off the plane entirely. Not everyone poses an equal threat. Rifling through the bags of every business traveler and patting down every preschooler and octogenarian would waste the TSA’s time and needlessly burden many passengers."Kayyem says that the "same principle" justifies limiting the spread of the coronavirus by preventing the unvaccinated from flying.WHO CALLS FOR MORATORIUM ON VACCINE BOOSTER SHOTS"Flying is not a right," Kayyem explains, adding that "the federal government is the sole entity that can regulate the terms and conditions of airline safety."Kayyem added that requiring passengers to show proof of vaccination would be a "minor inconvenience.""For the privilege of flying, Americans already give up a lot: We disclose our personal information, toss our water bottles, extinguish our cigarette butts, and lock our guns in checked luggage. For vaccinated people, having to show proof of vaccination when flying would be a minor inconvenience," she wrote.Kayyem’s article comes as the Biden administration has increased pressure on states and businesses to require proof of vaccination for employees, while alsopushinga vaccine mandate for federal workers.This week, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin isexpectedto announce that all active-duty military personnel must be vaccinated against the coronavirus.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPPresident Biden has oftenreferredto getting vaccinated as a "patriotic duty," as many Republicans object to the idea of a vaccine mandated by the government.Officials in New York City recently announced that both workers and customers in many indoor locations such as restaurants and gyms will berequiredto show proof of vaccination.Andrew Mark Miller is a writer at Fox News.

Luckily, we have moved beyond the era of lockdowns, but many folks are still pushing back against vax mandates and mask rules.Matthew Walther, who lives in a rural region of southwestMichigan, writes inThe Atlanticthat no one in his area cares about COVID anymore."Outside the world inhabited by the professional and managerial classes in a handful of major metropolitan areas," he says, "many, if not most, Americans are leading their lives as if COVID is over, and they have been for a long while."And yet he acknowledges that the average number of new cases in his county is as high as it’s ever been, with 136 deaths attributed to the virus since June 2020. Still, Walther makes the "real America" argument:"I wager that I am now closer to most of my fellow Americans than the people, almost absurdly overrepresented inmediaand elite institutions, who are still genuinely concerned about this virus. And in some senses my situation has always been more in line with the typical American’s pandemic experience than that of someone inNew YorkorWashington, D.C., orLos Angeles."Maybe he’s right, and maybe his party-like-there’s-no-pandemic approach works fine for Walther and his family.

They want to take more trips and go to concerts. The through-line I heard was a sense of exhaustion with pessimistic news and disgust at the idea of more isolation. The 2020 shutdowns and stay-at-home orders hit young people especially hard, generating a surge of new stresses that made things like dating, making friends, and learning uniquely difficult."CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPI can certainly understand how having a year or more of college reduced to remote learning really upended their lives. And I get that younger and healthier people feel less jeopardized if they do happen to contract the virus.So here’s the paradox: Another virus surge is coming, and while there are more ways to deter and treat the disease, people are still dying.
