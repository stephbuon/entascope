This cuts in half the earlier recommendation of 10 days of isolation.Data shows that the majority of coronavirus transmission "occurs early in the course of illness," the CDC explained — generally in the one or two days before symptoms begin and two or three days after."Therefore, people who test positive should isolate for 5 days and, if asymptomatic at that time, they may leave isolation if they can continue to mask for 5 days to minimize the risk of infecting others," theCDC said in a statement.The CDC has also updated its recommended quarantine period for people exposed to the virus. It says unvaccinated people should quarantine for five days, followed by five days of "strict mask use." Exposed people who are more than six months past their second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines, or two months out from a Johnson & Johnson vaccine, should also quarantine for five days.People who have gotten their booster shot don't need to quarantine after exposure but should wear a mask for the next 10 days.Alejandro Brown receives a COVID-19 vaccine from a health care worker at a drive-through site in Miami on Dec. 16.Joe Raedle/Getty Imageshide captionAlejandro Brown receives a COVID-19 vaccine from a health care worker at a drive-through site in Miami on Dec. 16."The Omicron variant is spreading quickly and has the potential to impact all facets of our society," said the CDC's director, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, in a statement. "CDC's updated recommendations for isolation and quarantine balance what we know about the spread of the virus and the protection provided by vaccination and booster doses. These updates ensure people can safely continue their daily lives."Loading...Dr. Megan Ranney, the associate dean at Brown University's School of Public Health,tweeted Mondaythat a major reason the federal government altered isolation requirements is due to the economic strain of a full quarantine."Our economy is going to shut down if everyone has to isolate for 10 days.  Luckily the science backs up the move, at least partially," she tweeted. "On the one hand: I'm all for following the science for the vaccinated & asymptomatic. No reason to keep people home unnecessarily."Kudos, she said, to the CDC "for recognizing that our knowledge has changed - and the virus has changed" especially for the vaccinated.Ranney said what would make this decision even safer would be to require a rapid test before ending isolation.The CDC doesn't currently require this step and rapid, at-home COVID testshave been hard to come byduring the omicron surge.The Biden administration, which has come under pressure for not increasing widespread availability of at-home tests, last weekrolled out a planto set up federal testing across the country. The government will also buy a half-billion at-home COVID test kits and mail them out. But deliveries won't start until January.The new guidance comes days after the CDCloosened rulesfor how long health care workers should isolate after infection with the coronavirus, from 10 days to seven days. If there were staffing shortages, that isolation time could be further reduced.The next day, New York officialsfollowed suit, reducing to five the number of days for health care workers to isolate after a positive coronavirus test. On NPR'sMorning EditiononMonday, Dr. Anthony Faucipraised the move.Five days of quarantine should be enough for health care workers, Fauci said, adding: "That's going to be under consideration of whether or not we want to diminish it" for the general public.In the U.S. as of Monday, 242 million people have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, 205 million are fully vaccinated and 66 million have received a booster, according to the CDC'sCOVID Data Tracker.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention dropped its advisory warning Wednesday for cruise travel after more than two years of warning Americans.Joe Raedle/Getty Imageshide captionThe Norwegian Gateway cruise ship is moored at PortMiami on Jan. 7 in Miami. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention dropped its advisory warning Wednesday for cruise travel after more than two years of warning Americans.The Center for Disease Control and Prevention has lifted its risk advisory for cruise ship travel Wednesday following two years of issuing warnings to travelers about the possibility of contracting COVID-19 onboard a cruise.In anupdateposted online, the agency removed its "Cruise Ship Travel Health Notice," a notice that recommended individuals against traveling onboard cruise ships. Three months ago, the CDCincreasedits travel warnings for cruises to Level 4 — the highest level —  following investigations of ships that had COVID outbreaks.While the CDC has lifted its travel health notice, officials say it's up to the passengers to determine their own health risks before going onboard a cruise ship."While cruising will always pose some risk of COVID-19 transmission, travelers will make their own risk assessment when choosing to travel on a cruise ship, much like they do in all other travel settings," the agency said in a statement to NPR.The agency says it will continue to provide guidance to the cruise ship industry in order for cruise lines to operate in a way that will provide "safer and healthier" environments for crews, passengers and communities.News of the CDC's decision to remove its travel health notice was praised by the Cruise Lines International Association, the industry's largest trade organization."Today's decision by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to altogether remove the Travel Health Notice for cruising recognizes the effective public health measures in place on cruise ships and begins to level the playing field, between cruise and similarly situated venues on land, for the first time since March 2020.From the onset of the pandemic, CLIA's cruise line members have prioritized the health and safety of their guests, crew, and the communities they visit and are sailing today with health measures in place that are unmatched by virtually any other commercial setting."The CDC emphasizes that travelers should make sure they're up to date with their COVID-19 vaccines before taking a cruise, in addition to following their  ship's requirements and recommendations against the virus.Travelers are urged to check their cruise ship's COVID case levels and vaccination requirements online before traveling, the agency says.byJonathan FranklinWhite House press secretary Jen Psaki speaks during a press briefing at the White House on March 17, 2022, in Washington.

The NFL has suspended all aspects of its COVID-19 protocols, citing recent trends showing that the spread of the coronavirus is declining.The NFL and the NFL Players Association announced Wednesday they have agreed tosuspend all COVID-19 protocolsgoing into the 2022 football season, effective immediately.In a memo released by the league, both the NFL and the players' association announced the suspension, meaning the NFL will no longer conduct mandatory testing for any of its players and staff.Theleague citesthe "encouraging trends regarding the prevalence and severity of COVID-19, the evolving guidance from the CDC, changes to state law and the counsel of our respective experts" as reasons for the change in COVID protocols.With thechange in protocols, players and staff will no longer have to wear face coverings at team facilities, regardless of vaccination status. Each club, however, can require face coverings "if they elect to do so."Moving forward, the league says that players and staff must continue to monitor themselves for any COVID-19 symptoms "on a daily basis" prior to entering any NFL facility, according to the memo.Anyone displaying symptoms must report it to the team and show proof of a negative test before entering any NFL facility. Those that test positive, however, must self-isolate for five days after their test.Here’s the memo that just went to clubs on the NFL and NFLPA suspending all COVID-19 protocols. No more masks, tracking devices, mandatory surveillance testing or capacity limits, unless required by state and local law.pic.twitter.com/TIdvfCWr9mLeague officials say they will continue to "prioritize the health and safety of players, coaches and staff" as they have done so since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic."Should there be a reason to reimpose aspects of the Protocols or to take other measures, we will work closely with clubs, the NFLPA and our respective experts, and local, state and federal public health officials to continue to safeguard the health of the NFL community," the league said in its memo, according toNFL's Tom Pelissero.The NFL continued the memo by emphasizing that teams must remain "in compliance with state and local law" and are "free to continue reasonable measures to protect their staff and players."News of Thursday's memo from the league comes after two NFL seasons were played under the implemented protocols brought on by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.While no NFL games were canceled during the 2020 and 2021 seasons due to the COVID-19, many teams ended up moving games during the 2020 schedule, according toThe Associated Press.

The U.S. passed 900,000 deaths from COVID-19 on Friday.Damian Dovarganes/APhide captionDiana Merchant self-tests for the coronavirus at a drive-through testing site in Whittier, Calif., on Jan. 25. The U.S. passed 900,000 deaths from COVID-19 on Friday.The U.S. has crossed yet another tragic landmark in the battle against COVID-19. On Friday, the country surpassed900,000 deathsfrom the disease, two years after the first COVID-19 cluster was reported in Wuhan, China. Public health experts say coming close to the 1 million death mark from the coronavirus is "inevitable.""It's absolutely staggering," said Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University, which has tracked the number of COVID-19 deaths during the pandemic. "It's unreal, frankly. And what makes it an even ... greater heartbreak — as if the loss of 900,000 souls weren't enough of a heartbreak — is the fact that it's probably an undercount of the number of people that we've lost."University of Texas at Austin professor and epidemiologist Lauren Ancel Meyers said the "horrible milestone" didn't have to happen."It was not inevitable. There are things that we could have done and should have done ... to protect those who were most vulnerable," she said. "It's a very sad day."President Joe Biden marked the "tragic milestone," recognizing the "emotional, physical and psychological weight of this pandemic" and urged Americans to do their part.I urge all Americans: get vaccinated, get your kids vaccinated, and get your booster shot if you are eligible," Biden said in a statement. "It's free, easy, and effective — and it can save your life, and the lives of those you love."The rolling seven-day average for daily COVID-19 deaths has been above 2,000 since Jan. 23, according to data from theCenters for Disease Control and Prevention. That's nearly three times higher than in November, when the agency was reporting a seven-day average of 700 daily deaths.As COVID-19 vaccines have become widely available for Americans, the number of those who have received at least one dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna or Johnson & Johnson vaccine continues to increase.However, the percentage of fully vaccinated Americans is still relatively low at approximately 64%. Amid the most recent surge of the now dominant omicron variant, unvaccinated people were 97 times more likely to die compared with those who were boosted, according to data cited this week by CDC Director Rochelle Walensky.Public health experts note that broader vaccination and boosting would have reduced the number of deaths. "We would have at least 300,000 fewer deaths. Probably more ...  than that,"  if the early pace of vaccination had been sustained, said Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health. "But at least 300,000 Americans who have perished would still be with us. It's tragic."According to thelatest CDC data, 42% of eligible Americans have received a booster.byThe Associated PressSandra Castro vaccinates first-grader Kristen Cruz, 6, at KIPP Believe Charter School in New Orleans last week ahead of Tuesday's deadline for all students in the city's school system to be vaccinated.Ted Jackson/APhide captionSandra Castro vaccinates first-grader Kristen Cruz, 6, at KIPP Believe Charter School in New Orleans last week ahead of Tuesday's deadline for all students in the city's school system to be vaccinated.NEW ORLEANS — As school systems across the U.S. struggle to keep classrooms open amid the pandemic, New Orleans is set to become the nation's first major district to mandate COVID-19 vaccinations for children 5 and up, though state regulations will allow parents to opt out easily.Ahead of Tuesday's deadline, many schools in the city have been holding vaccination events, including one at KIPP Believe school.One by one, dozens of children presented their signed permission slips, pushed up the sleeves of their pale yellow school uniform shirts and — often wincing, but rarely with tears — received a shot. Then they got candy.Some said they had loved ones who had gotten the coronavirus and wanted to do what they could to protect their families. Others said their parents decided. Eight-year-old Nyla Carey had talked to her mother."She said that the COVID shot was to protect you. And so now I want to be brave," the third-grader said before going back to class.Schools Superintendent Henderson Lewis said the requirement, announced in December  in the district of nearly 46,000 students, won't lead to youngsters being kicked out of school come Tuesday.Waivers for those opposed to vaccination are easy to obtain under state regulations, and schools will work with students who aren't inoculated, he said. But eventually everyone will have to be vaccinated or have a waiver.New Orleans is a Democratic enclave in a red state, and the city and the district are outliers in the South, where many parents and elected officials have balked at measures to control the coronavirus.In fact, Louisiana Health Department guidelines  say parents can obtain waivers from any immunization simply by citing medical, religious or philosophical objections.Tulane University epidemiologist Susan Hassig said that even with the waiver option, the mandate is a good way to get students vaccinated. She said parents who were a little unsure or hadn't gotten around to it will have a stronger motivation to get their kids' shots.The New Orleans public school system consists entirely of charter schools, which are taxpayer-supported but independently operated. It has a mask mandate in place, and thousands of students are tested weekly. There's been little of the public controversy seen in other districts, where parents have berated school boards.Henderson said the mandate was a bottom-up decision, with charter school operators across the district submitting letters of support, as opposed to district officials imposing the policy on their own.About one-quarter of the district's schools were closed to in-person learning in mid-January as the omicron wave hit staff members and students, according to Henderson.Christine Pitts of the Center on Reinventing Public Education suggested that the charter schools' habit of operating independently might have played a role in their support for the vaccine requirement.The measure is also in step with others taken by the city at large to curb the virus, including a recently reinstituted mask mandate and vaccination requirements for everyone 5 and older to enter certain places, such as restaurants.A few other school districts around the country have taken similar measures. Students in Washington, D.C., will be required to be vaccinated by March 1. The Los Angeles school system delayed a requirement  that students 12 and up be vaccinated after it became clear that thousands of unvaccinated students who didn't meet the requirement would have to do online learning.But many states have gone the other direction, in some cases banning schools from mandating  the vaccine.About 55% of all 5- to 17-year-olds in New Orleans have had at least one dose of the vaccine, according to city figures. Statewide the number is about 26%. That compares with 66% of 12- to 17-year-olds and 30% of 5- to 11-year-olds nationally, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Tulane's Cowen Institute, which studies education issues, surveyed New Orleans parents in October  and found that vaccine mandates for students were opposed by 48% and supported by 44%. Black parents and parents in lower-income brackets were more strongly opposed.About 60% of the city is Black and 24% of the city is in poverty, according to census figures.But the report's author, Vincent Rossmeier, noted that in the rapidly changing pandemic, a few months can make a big difference. Since the poll was taken, vaccines have become available for 5- to 11-year-olds, and the omicron variant has caused widespread school disruptions.Outside Bricolage Academy, Renee Price waited to pick up her 10-year-old son. He was vaccinated about a month ago, and she was glad. She doesn't want him missing any more school or having to go to Zoom classes again."They get vaccines for other things to go to school. So I don't see there's that much difference," she said.At Warren Easton High School, Likithe McNeil was ready to lay down the law to get her 16-year-old vaccinated but didn't have to after they talked about how it would make it easier for the girl to get back to school and see her friends. McNeil said she does not have a problem with the mandate."We'll never get back to normal if we don't do what we need to do," she said.But some parents are more concerned. Michel Palmer, who waited in a long line of cars at Lake Forest Charter to pick up her 8- and 10-year-olds, said she is a little hesitant about the vaccine and hasn't gotten herself or her kids vaccinated. She applied for and received a waiver."It's up to the parents to decide whether they want to get their kids vaccinated," she said.byJonathan FranklinShown above are rapid at-home COVID-19 test kits ready to be distributed by the GreenRoots environmental protection organization and Chelsea Community Connections in Chelsea, Massachusetts.JOSEPH PREZIOSO/AFP via Getty Imageshide captionShown above are rapid at-home COVID-19 test kits ready to be distributed by the GreenRoots environmental protection organization and Chelsea Community Connections in Chelsea, Massachusetts.If you live in New Hampshire and are having trouble getting an at-home rapid COVID-19 test, you might soon find them among the bottles at state-run liquor stores.The New Hampshire Executive Council approved the request to sell 1 million at-home rapid COVID tests at liquor outlets across the state, Gov.

The Pacific island nations of Kiribati and Samoa have announced rare COVID-19 lockdowns after dozens of international travelers tested positive for the virus.Kiribati and Samoa both implemented COVID-19 lockdowns on Saturday after international arrivals brought the virus with them, a rarity for the remote Pacific island nations.This is the first pandemic lockdown in Kiribati, which had previously reported only two COVID-19 cases — both were people on a fishingship in May 2021who isolated on board. The countryreopened its bordersto international travel earlier this month for the first time in nearly two years.Its governmentannounced on Tuesdaythat 36 out of 54 passengers on a flight from Fiji had tested positive for COVID-19 upon arrival, despite being vaccinated and testing negative three times during the pre-departure quarantine period. They were escorted to a quarantine center for further monitoring and testing. One of the frontline workers stationed outside the quarantine center also tested positive.On Friday,the government confirmed a new case, this time from someone uninvolved with the quarantine center.Based on the newest case, "there is now an assumption that COVID-19 is now spreading in the community on South Tarawa and Betio," the government wrote on Facebook.South Tarawa is part of Kiribati's capital and home to abouthalf of its population, or some 63,000 people.A 24-hour curfew went into effect on Saturday and it's not clear how long the lockdown will last.Residents can only leave their homes to access emergency or essential services including hospitals, police departments, grocery stores and banks. Essential providers can only operate during certain hours, public transportation will not run, social gatherings are banned and travel between the outer islands is prohibited.The government also urged residents to get vaccinated. Only about 53% of adults had received two doses as of late December, according toRadio Kiribati.In Samoa,officials announceda 48-hour lockdown after 15 out of 73 passengers who arrived on a Wednesday flight from Brisbane, Australia, tested positive.Samoa had previously confirmed justtwo COVID-19 casessince the start of the pandemic, according to the World Health Organization.

In a 6-3 vote, the court rejected the Biden administration's plan to require vaccines or regular COVID testing at companies with more than 100 workers."We respect the court's ruling and will comply," Starbucks Chief Operating Officer John Culver wrote in the memo.Starbucks' reversal is among the most high-profile corporate actions in response to the Supreme Court ruling. The company employs 228,000 people in the U.S.Boston-based General Electric Co. also suspended its vaccine mandate last week, according to IUE-CWA Local 201, a union that represents machinists, electricians and other GE employees. GE, which employs 56,000 people in the U.S., had initially called for employees to get fully vaccinated no later than Feb. 11.But other companies have kept their mandates in place. Citigroup Inc., one of the largest U.S. banks, announced in October that employees needed to be vaccinated or receive an accommodation by Jan. 14. New York-based Citi said Wednesday that 99% of its employees have complied so far.Work clothing maker Carhartt also stuck to its vaccine mandate. The Dearborn, Mich.-based company, which has 3,000 U.S. workers, told employees in an email last Friday that the Supreme Court decision wouldn't impact its own mandate, which went into effect this month."Carhartt fully understands and respects the varying opinions on this topic, and we are aware some of our associates do not support this policy. However, we stand behind our decision because we believe vaccines are necessary to protect our workforce," the company said.Carhartt said the "vast majority" of its employees have gotten vaccines. The company has also granted some medical or religious waivers.Some big companies like Target and McDonald's stayed mum on their vaccination plans for frontline workers as the issue moved through the courts. Many companies, facing labor shortages, have been loathe to force requirements on workers, who might choose to go elsewhere.A November survey of more than 500 U.S. companies by the consulting firm Willis Towers Watson showed that very few employers with vaccination requirements — 3% — had seen a spike in resignations. But nearly one-third of those planning mandates said they were very concerned that the mandates could cause employees to leave. On the other hand, nearly half of employers surveyed believe that vaccine mandates could help recruit and retain employees.On Jan. 3, Starbucks said it would require all employees to be vaccinated by Feb. 9 or face a weekly COVID test requirement, citing the Biden administration's rules. At the time, Culver said it was the responsibility of Starbucks' leadership "to do whatever we can to help keep you safe and create the safest work environment possible."In Tuesday's memo, Culver said the company continues to strongly encourage vaccinations and booster shots. The company also told workers on Tuesday that they shouldn't wear cloth masks to work, and should instead use medical-grade surgical masks provided by the company.Starbucks required workers to reveal their vaccination status by Jan. 10. The company said Wednesday that 90% have reported and the "vast majority" are fully vaccinated. Starbucks wouldn't say what percent of workers are not fully vaccinated.byScott NeumanDr. Anthony Fauci, White House chief medical adviser and director of the NIAID, testifies at a Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee hearing on Capitol Hill last week.Greg Nash/Pool/Getty Imageshide captionDr. Anthony Fauci, White House chief medical adviser and director of the NIAID, testifies at a Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee hearing on Capitol Hill last week.Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top White House medical adviser, says that the coronavirus pandemic won't end with the elimination of the virus. Instead, he says that a less dangerous and disruptive strain of the virus will likely take hold and become endemic.Speaking Monday at the World Economic Forum's Davos Agenda, Fauci said scientists don't know how exactly the pandemic will finally play out and that it's important "to be openly honest about that."However, he said "if you look at the history of infectious diseases, we've only eradicated one infectious disease in man, and that's smallpox. That's not going to happen with this virus.""But hopefully it will be at such a low level that it doesn't disrupt our normal social, economic and other interactions," said Fauci, who is director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases."I think that's what most people feel when they talk about in endemicity, where it is integrated into the broad range of infectious diseases that we experience," such as the flu, he said.Fauci said it may still be too early to tell whether the surge in cases driven by the omicron variant will push the pandemic toward a more manageable phase, "but I would hope that's the case.""That would only be the case if we don't get another variant that eludes the immune response to the prior variant," Fauci cautioned.Fauci's remarks come as the omicron variant of the coronavirus is causing a huge worldwide spike in new cases. The sheer number of people who have become infected with the variant has overwhelmed medical resources in many parts of the world, even though omicron has proved to be less deadly than its delta predecessor.Some 5.4 million new cases of coronavirus infection were reported last week in the U.S. alone, according to data tallied byJohns Hopkins University. Since the start of the pandemic, nearly 852,000 Americans have died from COVID-19. Worldwide, the disease has claimed more than 5.5 million lives.A version of this story originally appearedin theMorning Editionlive blogbyThe Associated PressA man wearing a face mask to curb the spread of coronavirus, sits on a bench as pedestrians walk outside Evangelismos hospital in Athens, Greece, Monday, Jan. 17, 2022.Thanassis Stavrakis/APhide captionA man wearing a face mask to curb the spread of coronavirus, sits on a bench as pedestrians walk outside Evangelismos hospital in Athens, Greece, Monday, Jan. 17, 2022.ATHENS, Greece — Greece imposed a vaccination mandate Monday for people 60 and older, as the country's vaccination rate remains below the European Union average and a spike in infections has put sustained pressure on Greek hospitals.Older people failing to get vaccinated will face penalties, starting at a 50-euro ($57) fine in January and followed by a monthly fine of 100 euros ($114) after that.About two-thirds of Greece's 10.7 million people are fully vaccinated, while the EU average is just over 70%. But COVID-19 deaths and daily hospitalizations have increased following the arrival of the highly contagious omicron variant, though pressure on ICU capacity has eased slightly.Health Minister Thanos Plevris said the fines would be collected through the tax office with the money going to help fund state hospitals."The age factor is important because of its impact on the public health service," Plevris told private Open TV on Sunday.Greece imposed a vaccination mandate for health care workers last year. And starting Feb. 1, vaccination certificates for adults will expire after seven months unless the holder receives a booster shot.New infections surged sharply in early January but have eased over the past week.The vaccination mandate for the 60 and older age group was announced in late December and, according to government data, 41.5% of the 530,000 people targeted by the measure are now fully vaccinated. Opinion polls suggest strong public support for the mandate, but some lawmakers across party lines have questioned the legality of singling out a specific group. The government defended the measure as constitutional, citing a 2020 high court decision allowing public day care centers to refuse children who had not been vaccinated for childhood illnesses.Government spokesman Giannis Oikonomou said only people with legitimate health exemptions, those who had suffered a recent infection and applicants for home vaccination appointments that were delayed would be spared the fine."The law will be fully enforced," Oikonomou said.Greece has the seventh oldest population in the world, as measured by share of residents aged 65 and over, according to the U.S.-based Population Reference Bureau. It has seen nearly 22,000 virus-related deaths in the pandemic.byThe Associated PressTrash sits out for collection on a Philadelphia street on Thursday. The omicron variant is sickening so many sanitation workers that waste collection in Philadelphia and other cities has been delayed or suspended.Matt Rourke/APhide captionTrash sits out for collection on a Philadelphia street on Thursday. The omicron variant is sickening so many sanitation workers that waste collection in Philadelphia and other cities has been delayed or suspended.Theomicron variantis sickening so many sanitation workers around the U.S. that some cities have had to delay or suspend garbage or recycling pickup, angering residents shocked that governments can't perform this most basic of functions.The slowdowns have caused recycling bins full of Christmas gift boxes and wrapping paper to languish on Nashville curbs, trash bags to pile up on Philadelphia streets, and uncollected yard waste — grass clippings, leaves, branches — to block sidewalks in Atlanta."It's just a shame," said Madelyn Rubin, who lives in Jacksonville, Florida, where officials have halted recycling."You know that they could find the money to do it if they wanted to," she said. "If it was a business that wanted to come in here, they would dump money in to make it happen."Cities including Atlanta, Nashville and Louisville are so shorthanded they have temporarily stopped collecting things like recyclable bottles, cans, paper and plastic, yard waste or oversized junk to focus on the grosser, smellier stuff. The delays are more than annoyance to residents, creating problems such as clogged storm drains and blocked sidewalks.Nashville City Council member Freddie O'Connell was just as surprised as his constituents when he received notice before Christmas that the city was halting curbside recycling."I was just stunned there wasn't an alternative or a back-up plan," he said. "No hot line for people who are mobility impaired or don't have reliable access to a car" to carry their recyclables to a central drop-off site."It feels like a failure of governance," he added.The garbage crisis is actually the third of the pandemic. Thefirst happened in the spring of 2020, when COVID-19 took hold in the U.S. Problems arose again as the delta variant spiked over the summer.The Solid Waste Association of North America warned government officials and trash haulers in December to "plan now for staffing shortages."The highly contagious variant hit just when Americans were generating a lot of trash — over the Christmas holidays. Combine that with a relatively low vaccination level among front-line sanitation workers and you have a "perfect storm for delayed collection," the association's executive director, David Biderman, said this week.In some communities, up to a quarter of the waste-collection workforce is calling in sick, Biderman said.Garbage collection has become just another of the many basic services disrupted by omicron. Around the U.S., teachers, firefighters, police officers and transit workers have been out sick in large numbers."We're getting calls, emails, everything. People are understandably frustrated," said Atlanta City Council member Liliana Bakhtiari.Atlanta officials said Monday that because of the worker shortage, recycling and yard waste will be picked up "as staffing allows."Los Angeles said delays in the collection of recyclables could continue through the month.In Louisville, Kentucky, sanitation workers stopped picking up yard waste in early January until further notice. Residents can drop off branches and clippings at Christmas tree collection sites.New York City, which boasts the largest municipal sanitation force in the world, had around 2,000 of its 7,000 workers out because of the latest round of the coronavirus, but the rest are working long hours to clear a backlog of waste. They city has not suspended any services.Harry Nespoli, president of the union local representing the city's sanitation workers, said some are coming back after quarantining, while others are testing positive for the virus: "Right now it's a swinging door."In Philadelphia, sometimes called Filthadelphia because of the condition of its streets, around 10% to 15% of the 900-person sanitation workforce is out on any given day, leading to delays in waste collection, according to Streets Commissioner Carlton Williams."When people are out, we can't just hire to replace them," he said. "We have to give them time to get well."To keep the trash from piling up, some municipalities are hiring temporary workers or contracting with private haulers. Some are offering signing or retention bonuses or pay raises.Chattanooga, Tennessee, increased starting wages for drivers by more than 40%, from just over $31,500 to $45,000.That allowed the city to restore recycling collection in November after halting it in July and continue routine pickups despite the omicron surge, said spokesperson Mary Beth Ikard.byJonathan FranklinWest Virginia Gov.

Jim Justice was supposed to deliver his State of the State address Wednesday but is instead feeling "extremely unwell" after testing positive for COVID-19.Justice, 70, who said he is fully vaccinated and boosted, is experiencing moderate symptoms and is self-isolating at home.In astatementfrom his office, Justice said he woke up Tuesday morning with congestion and cough. A little while later, the Republican governor said he developed a headache and fever.By late Tuesday afternoon, his blood pressure and heart rate were elevated and he had a high fever, according to the statement.Results from his rapid test in the morning came back negative. However, results from his PCR test came back positive, Justice said. The governor is receiving a monoclonal antibody treatment to help alleviate his symptoms.Tonight I tested positive for COVID-19.While I was surprised that my test results came back positive, I’m thankful to the Lord above that I’ve been vaccinated, I’ve been boosted, and that I have an incredible support system, especially my loving family.https://t.co/x8u0f6qYH5"While I was surprised that my test results came back positive, I'm thankful to the Lord above that I've been vaccinated, I've been boosted, and that I have an incredible support system, especially my loving family," Justice said.Everyone that the governor has been in close contact with over the past few days is being notified. West Virginia first lady Cathy Justice tested negative Tuesday evening, according to the statement.Gov. Justice's office did not immediately respond to a request to comment on how the governor was feeling Wednesday."I ask everyone to continue praying for the 5,452 great West Virginians that we've lost. We need to keep pulling the rope together," Justice said. "We're going to get through this and put an end to this terrible pandemic once and for all."West Virginia's COVID-19 czar, Dr. Clay Marsh, said he has "full confidence" that Justice will recover quickly because he was fully vaccinated and received a booster dose of the COVID vaccine."Without the immunity afforded by those vaccines, his outcome could be much worse. I continue to strongly encourage all West Virginians to take the COVID-19 vaccine and get boosted when it's time to do so," Marsh said in a statement.Justice's positive COVID-19 test came a day before he was scheduled to deliver theannual State of the State address. The address was delivered as a written message, which state archivists say is a first in modern state history.byAndrea HsuA woman checks in for her flight at a United Airlines counter at Dulles International Airport on December 27, 2021.Anna Moneymaker/Getty Imageshide captionA woman checks in for her flight at a United Airlines counter at Dulles International Airport on December 27, 2021.Amid a flurry of flight cancellations, United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby offered a window into the staffing challenges employers are facing due to the omicron surge."We have about 3,000 employees who are currently positive for COVID. Just as an example, in one day alone at Newark, nearly one-third of our workforce called out sick," he wrote ina memo to employeeson Tuesday.U.S. airlines have had to cancel tens of thousands of flights in recent weeks due to a combination of winter weather and staffing shortages, leaving travelers stranded and frustrated over the holidays. Now, Kirby said United is working to cancel flights early when necessary, before customers arrive at the airport, and is reducing flights to ensure there is enough staff on hand to handle customer needs.In the memo, Kirby also took the opportunity to emphasize thatthe airline's vaccine mandateis working — despite the large number of employees testing positive.He noted that among United's 3,000 employees who currently have COVID-19, zero of its vaccinated employees are currently hospitalized.Moreover, he revealed that prior to the airline's vaccine mandate, which took effect in September, more than one United employee was dying from COVID-19 every week, on average."But we've now gone eight straight weeks with zero COVID-related deaths among our vaccinated employees," he wrote, noting that based on available data, that means approximately eight to 10 lives were saved by the vaccine requirement."While I know that some people still disagree with our policy, United is proving that requiring the vaccine is the right thing to do because it saves lives," Kirby wrote.United was among the first companies in the U.S. to require COVID-19 vaccinations for all of its employees, rolling out its policy in early August. By late September, more than 97% of its 67,000 U.S.-based employees had gotten the shots and a couple thousand were granted religious or medical exemptions.byThe Associated PressA woman gets her results after getting tested for COVID-19, outside a pharmacy in Mexico City on Monday.Marco Ugarte/APhide captionA woman gets her results after getting tested for COVID-19, outside a pharmacy in Mexico City on Monday.MEXICO CITY — Mexico's president announced Monday he has come down with COVID-19 a second time, as coronavirus infections spike in Mexico and virus tests become scarce.President Andrés Manuel López Obrador wrote that he tested positive, after he had sounded hoarse at a morning news briefing. He contracted COVID-19 and recovered from it the first time in early 2021."Even though the symptoms are light, I will remain isolated and only work from the office and hold on-line meetings until further notice," the president wrote in his social media accounts. "In the meantime, Interior Secretary Adán Augusto López Hernández will take over for me at press conferences and other events."Two of the president's Cabinet secretaries, the heads of the Environment and Economy departments, announced they had tested positive in recent days.Earlier on in the day, the president told Mexicans to just assume they had COVID-19 if they had symptoms. The number of confirmed cases spiked by 186% last week. .López Obrador claimed the Omicron variant is "a little COVID," noting hospitalizations and deaths had not increased at the same rate. However, experts say those are both lagging indicators that may not show up for weeks after infections spike.Reading advice posted on Twitter, the president said Mexicans with symptoms should just stay at home, take paracetamol and isolate, rather than going out and trying to find tests.Since Christmas, private pharmacies and the few available testing centers have been overwhelmed by long lines. The Twitter advice drew on guidelines from Mexico City and other health authorities.López Obrador's administration has long refused to implement mass testing, calling it a waste of money. He called on companies not to require COVID tests for employees.Mexico passed 300,000 test-confirmed coronavirus deaths last week, but so little testing is done in the country of 126 million that a government review of death certificates puts the real toll at almost 460,000.The virus spike was largely responsible for the cancelation of 260 flights between Jan. 6 and Jan. 10, the president said, as airline employees got infected and had to isolate, causing staff shortages.José Merino, the head of Mexico City's Digital Innovation Agency, said the capital had the same number of Covid cases as the peak of January 2020, but only 6% as many people hospitalized. he wrote in his Twitter account that 70% of those hospitalized were not vaccinated.byJonathan FranklinA health worker grabs at-home COVID-19 test kits to be handed out last month in Youngstown, Ohio.

Since Saturday, private health insurers have been required to cover up to eight at-home COVID-19 tests per month for those on their plans, the Biden administration announced last week.Starting Wednesday, Americans will be able to order free COVID-19 tests online from the Biden administration, ina plan outlined last week. They're also now able to get reimbursements from their private insurance.Individuals covered by a health insurance plan who purchase an over-the-counter COVID-19 diagnostic test that has been authorized, cleared or approved by the Food and Drug Administration have beenable to have those test costs covered by their insurancesince Saturday.Insurance companies and health plans are now required to cover eight free over-the-counter at-home tests per covered individual per month, according to White House officials. For instance, a family of four all on the same plan would be able to get up to 32 of these tests covered by their health plan per month."We are requiring insurers and group health plans to make tests free for millions of Americans. This is all part of our overall strategy to ramp-up access to easy-to-use, at-home tests at no cost," Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra stated in anews releaseon Jan. 10.This follows up on an announcement that the White House madelast month.During White House news briefing last week,press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters that the administration will start to have free coronavirus tests "out the door in the coming weeks.""The contracts [for testing companies] are structured in a way to require that significant amounts are delivered on an aggressive timeline, the first of which should be arriving early next week," Psakisaid.Today, my administration announced that health insurers will be required to cover the cost of at-home COVID testing kits starting January 15th.The Biden administration says it is "incentivizing" insurers and group health plans to set up programs that will allow Americans to get the over-the-counter tests (PCR and rapid tests) directly through preferred pharmacies, retailers or other entities with no out-of-pocket costs.For people whose health care providers have ordered a COVID-19 test, the Biden administration said there will not be a limit on the number of tests that are covered — including at-home tests.Currently, state Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) programs must cover FDA-authorized at-home COVID-19 tests without cost-sharing.Americans who are covered by Medicare already have their COVID-19 diagnostic tests, such as PCR and antigen tests, performed by a laboratory "with no beneficiary cost-sharing when the test is ordered by either a physician, non-physician practitioner, pharmacist, or other authorized health care professional," the Biden administration says.At this time, those who are on Medicare will not be able to get their at-home COVID-19 tests reimbursed through the program, according to theCenters for Medicaid & Medicare Services. Currently, Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program plans are required to fully cover the cost of at-home tests.Last year, the Biden administration issued guidance saying that both state Medicaid and CHIP programs must cover all types of FDA-authorized COVID-19 tests without cost-sharing.byDeepa ShivaramA booster dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine is prepared during a vaccination clinic on Dec. 29 in Lawrence, Mass.

The FDA is now shortening the wait time between the second dose and the booster to five months from six months.The period between getting the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine and the first booster shot has been shortened to five months from six for people ages 18 and up, the Food and Drug Administration says.The FDA's announcementFriday comes as the highly contagiousomicron variantis spreading rapidly around the country and immunity from the first round of vaccines is fading. Over the weekend,more than 1 millionpeople in the U.S. were diagnosed with COVID-19."Vaccination is our best defense against COVID-19, including the circulating variants, and shortening the length of time between completion of a primary series and a booster dose may help reduce waning immunity," said Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, in a statement.Marks also said the change in wait time provides some consistency among some of the vaccines. On Monday, the FDA shortened the interval between the second Pfizer dose and booster tofive monthsas well. For those who got the single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine, the time between getting the vaccine and booster remains at two months.Moderna's first booster shot's efficacy is expected to last through the winter, the company's CEO said at a health care conference hosted by Goldman Sachs on Thursday, but by next fall the protection may start to dip again and a fourth shot of the vaccine would be necessary."I would expect that it's not going to hold great. ...

"Some facilities are going to be strapped."State officialsreinstated the indoor mask mandateon Dec. 15 last year and it was originally due to expire on Jan. 15.Currently, the state requires mask-wearing for everyone — regardless of vaccination status — in all indoor spaces, such as bars, restaurants and retail stores.Many counties across California have their own indoor mandates, so the new statewide order primarily affects the counties that don't.As Feb. 15 approaches, "we will again re-evaluate the condition across California, our communities and our health-care delivery settings to make sure that we are taking the latest information into account to determine if there would be another extension, or if we're prepared to lift that requirement across the state," Ghaly said, according to KABC-TV.Over the last two weeks, the statewide seven-day average case rate has increased by "more than sixfold" as hospitalizations across the state have doubled, the California Health Department said."While the percentage of Californians fully vaccinated and boosted continues to increase, we continue to have areas of the state where vaccine coverage is low, putting individuals and communities at greater risk for COVID-19," the departmentsaidin a statement."Implementing a universal masking requirement not only has proven to decrease the rate of infections but is able to slow community transmission," the department continued.As of Wednesday, nearly 65 million total COVID vaccines have been administered to those eligible.So far, nearly 80% of Californians have been vaccinated with at least one dose, with close to 144,000 people a day are receiving a vaccine, according to health officials.byThe Associated PressPro-union pins sit on a table during a watch party for a Starbucks employees union election on Dec. 9 in Buffalo, N.Y.Joshua Bessex/APhide captionPro-union pins sit on a table during a watch party for a Starbucks employees union election on Dec. 9 in Buffalo, N.Y.BUFFALO, N.Y. — Employees of a Starbucks store in upstate New York whovoted to unionizelast month walked off the job Wednesday, saying they lacked the staff and resources to work safely amid surging COVID-19 cases.Six employees who had been scheduled to work formed a picket line outside the Buffalo store, leading Starbucks to close it for the day, the company said. Three other employees had remained inside."Pressure to go to work is being put on many of us, when some of us already have other health issues.

Anya KamenetzAn empty classroom during the pandemic in Seoul, South Korea.Chung Sung-Jun/Getty Imageshide captionAn empty classroom during the pandemic in Seoul, South Korea.17 trillion dollars.That's how much the pandemic could cost today's children in terms of lost earnings over a lifetime. The number comes from a new report by the United Nations and the World Bank.Starting in March 2020 schools closed in nearly every country, for 1.6 billion children. Nearly 2 years later, interruptions continue here in the U.S. and part-time or remote learning is still going on in places from India to Brazil.In thisnew report, UNESCO, the educational arm of the U.N., along with UNICEF and the World Bank estimate what these months of disruption could ultimately mean. Shuttered schools combined with frozen economies not only means lost learning, it means students driven into the workforce, some for good.With less schooling, children learn fewer skills. That takes them out of the running for higher-wage jobs. If they don't make up the time lost in school, it could potentially lead to lost earning over a lifetime. The $17 trillion estimate is up considerably from a $10 trillion estimate released in 2020 because learning interruptions have dragged on.Before the pandemic, the world had been making progress getting more children into schools. Between 2000 and 2015 enrollment in elementary schools in developing countries rose 8 percentage points to 91%. The U.N. and related organizations had turned their attention from increasing the number of children who weren't in school at all to improving the quality of education students were receiving.There was a lot of work ahead to meet that latter goal. UNESCO has a simple benchmark for "learning poverty": Can a child, by the age of 10, read a simple sentence in their native language?Borhene Chakroun, UNESCO's director of the division for policies and lifelong learning systems, says that even before the pandemic, more than half the children in low- and middle-income countries could not do it."Usually those who are not achieving these basic metrics are the ones that are disadvantaged, discriminated against or coming from a lower socioeconomic background," he explains. According to the new report, learning poverty is expected to potentially affect more of those children because of the pandemic – up to 7 in 10.That uptick in learning poverty has been triggered in part by the gaps and flaws in remote learning, even in the wealthiest countries. "Most of the countries found that their capacity to respond to such a crisis, their resilience, the infrastructure in terms of remote and hybrid learning, in terms of equipping the teachers with the digital skills and digital pedagogy, are lacking," says Chakroun.This wasn't just a problem in countries like Mexico, Morocco and Malaysia, he says, but in France, where he is based, and in the United States. Around the world, children with disabilities, the youngest children and poorer children had the most trouble accessing or benefiting from remote learning.Because of gender discrimination, this report found, girls around the world were also less likely to have the chance to participate in remote learning during COVID. In one of the more striking examples of downstream impacts of the pandemic, UNICEF projected in March of this year that 10 million more girls around the world than previously estimated could be forced into child marriage in the next decade. They were more likely to have to take care of younger siblings. They may have been orphaned or their parents were driven further into poverty because of COVID. This is an economic problem and a humanitarian problem.The authors of this report emphasize that there is still time to recover.And they have recommendations that apply to both rich and poor countries.First: invest in education. Reopen schools for full-time in-person learning and offer supplemental education and other services to bring girls, lower-income and other groups back up to speed. The authors note that only about 3% of government COVID relief funds globally have gone to education so far.Second: innovate in teaching. Chakroun mentions a method calledTeaching at the Right Level, developed by Pratham, a nonprofit in India, which is now being tried in countries like Cote d'Ivoire. Basically it means working one-on-one and in small groups to catch children up based on where they are at the moment – teaching in a way that is more flexible and personalized and less rote than is the norm in many countries' classrooms.Third: International organizations are speaking up more forcefully than earlier in the pandemic to say that given all the major long-term drawbacks, school closures for COVID outbreaks should be avoided whenever possible, even during outbreaks like the current one."Our stance together with other partners has been you cannot open a supermarket and leave the schools closed," says Chakroun, who adds that the rule should be to close schools last and open them first.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

Joe HernandezDr. Anthony Fauci, chief medical adviser to President Biden, says easing quarantine rules for health care workers will help keep them in their essential jobs.Anna Moneymaker/Getty Imageshide captionDr. Anthony Fauci, chief medical adviser to President Biden, says easing quarantine rules for health care workers will help keep them in their essential jobs.Dr. Anthony Fauci, President Biden's chief medical adviser, is praising New York officials for lowering the number of days health care workers must remain in quarantine after having COVID-19.The state announced on Christmas Eve thatfully vaccinated health care staff and other essential workers can return to work five days after a positive coronavirus testif they meet certain safety standards. Previously they had to remain out for 10 days."You need the health care workers. And when you have them out for the full 10 days, and you do that over a wide swath of people, you can have a situation where you really do not have enough health care workers," Faucitold NPR'sMorning Editionon Monday."I think that's something that we're going to be considering" beyond New York, Fauci added.Public health officials have worried that the highly infectious omicron variant, though it may cause milder illness, could once again overwhelm hospitals with the sheer number of patients getting sick.The Centers for Disease Control and Preventionupdated its guidance for health care workers with COVID-19 last week, saying they could return to work after seven days if they were asymptomatic and had a negative test."As the healthcare community prepares for an anticipated surge in patients due to Omicron, CDC is updating our recommendations to reflect what we know about infection and exposure in the context of vaccination and booster doses,"CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said at the time.Fauci said easing quarantine guidance for the general population would be "under consideration" but added that the administration was currently focusing on getting essential workers back on the job.Fauci also said duringan interview on MSNBC'sMorning Joethat it would be "reasonable to consider" a vaccine requirement for domestic flights. He noted that such mandates already exist for some colleges and workplaces, and that it might help boost the number of Americans who get the shot."When you make vaccination a requirement, that's another incentive to get more people vaccinated," Fauci said. "If you want to do that with domestic flights, I think that's something that seriously should be considered."A version of this story originally appearedin theMorning Editionlive blog.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

At least four cruise liners were turned away from ports or not allowing passengers to disembark,CNN reported.Three college football teams announcedover the weekend that they would not be able to field teams in upcoming bowl games because of players testing positive for the virus.The number of daily cases in the U.S. topped 197,000 on Friday, a 65% increase over two weeks ago and nearing the record of 251,000 new daily cases set in January.Dr. Anthony Fauci warned Sunday that the number of new COVID-19 cases will continue to rise and that while the omicron variant doesn't appear to be as severe as earlier cases, "we don't want to get complacent," as the sheer number of new cases could outweigh the lower rate of hospitalizations."If you have many, many, many more people with a less level of severity, that might kind of neutralize the positive effect of having less severity when you have so many more people,"Fauci told ABC News'This Week."And we're particularly worried about those who are in that unvaccinated class ... those are the most vulnerable ones when you have a virus that is extraordinarily effective in getting to people."Around the country, long lines continued at COVID-19 testing sites.In New York City, where new vaccination mandates go into effect Monday, the rate of positive test results increased over the weekend across all five boroughs. In Florida, which set a record for the number of cases for a second time this week, cars lined up hours before coronavirus test sites opened and at-home tests quickly ran out at distribution centers.The omicron wave comes as hospitals across the country report staffing shortages.More than 25% of hospitals in 13 states are experiencingcritical shortages of medical staff,Forbesreported, citing data from the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Andrea HsuBeata Moon sits on the balcony of her Queens, New York, apartment on Dec. 9. Because she is not fully vaccinated, much of New York City is off-limits to her.Andrea Hsu/NPRhide captionBeata Moon sits on the balcony of her Queens, New York, apartment on Dec. 9. Because she is not fully vaccinated, much of New York City is off-limits to her.New York City's strict vaccine requirementsget even stricteras of Monday. Everyone 12 years old and up now has to show proof of full vaccination to dine in at restaurants, go to the movies, work out in gyms, or attend any kind of indoor performance.For Beata Moon, a composer, pianist and teaching artist in Queens, that means she will not be able to perform a recital in February at Musica Reginae, a community concert space.She cannot attend a March concert at Carnegie Hall, where a piece she composed,setting the words of people experiencing homelessness to music,will be performed.That's because Moon, 52, is only partially vaccinated, with one shot of Moderna last March, making her an outlier in New York City, where 4 out of 5 adults are fully vaccinated.Now, amid a stunning spread of the omicron variant in the U.S., there's a renewed campaign to get first, second and third doses in as many arms as possible. Public health officials, medical doctors and scientists agree that vaccines remain the most powerful tool we have against severe illness and hospitalization."I — honest to God — believe it's your patriotic duty" to get vaccinated, President Biden said in a speech addressing omicron last week.Yet Moon says her mind is made up. She will not get a second dose.Like many people, Moon was excited about the arrival of the vaccines early in  2021."Both my husband and I couldn't wait to get it," she says.She got a first dose of Moderna in late March. But a couple of weeks later, she began feeling ill — as if she might black out. She wondered if it might be Zoom fatigue. Her professional life had moved online. She'd been teaching workshops and performing piano recitals in front of an iPad for months.In New York City, where 4 out of 5 adults are fully vaccinated, vaccines are offered from a city bus parked outside a school.Andrea Hsu/NPRhide captionIn New York City, where 4 out of 5 adults are fully vaccinated, vaccines are offered from a city bus parked outside a school.But after awakening one night feeling so dizzy and nauseated she feared she would fall down, she went to urgent care, where she tested positive for the coronavirus. She went home to quarantine.For the first time in her life, she started experiencing ear ringing, or tinnitus. Slowly, she got better. And then, over the summer, her symptoms came back. The ear ringing was more pronounced: a high-pitched, ringing sound, sometimes with variation in volume.Tinnitusis a common condition. Every year, about 10% of adults in the U.S. experience at least an episode of it.In the CDC'sVaccine Adverse Event Reporting System,there were about 13,000 cases of tinnitus as of Dec. 17 — self-reported cases from patients and health care providers.People who have gotten sick with COVID-19 have also complained of ear ringing. In the U.K., the National Health Service lists tinnitus as acommon side effect of long COVID-19. And a review of scientific literature published in theInternational Journal of Audiologyfound tinnitus to be a commonly documented symptom among COVID-19 patients with an estimated 14.8% experiencing it. The authors did note a dearth of high-quality scientific studies on the topic.Moon has some friends and family members who believe that her tinnitus came from her bout with COVID-19, not from the vaccine. But she has come to a different conclusion after hearing from an online community of people who share accounts of severe reactions to the vaccines."Because so many others have similar issues — or even worse issues — after the vaccine, when they were healthy," she says.Her stance has been met with skepticism — and hostility. And in some ways, she understands why.More than 240 million people in the U.S. have gotten a COVID-19 vaccine. The vast majority have been just fine."To be honest, if I hadn't experienced this, I don't know if I would have believed when people say, 'Oh, I'm really suffering these side effects,'" says Moon.If it's not happening to you, she says, it's easy to label someone an anti-vaxxer or a conspiracy theorist.In the pandemic, Moon has been teaching workshops and performing recitals in front of an iPad. She hopes the virtual work will continue for a while.David Jacobyhide captionIn the pandemic, Moon has been teaching workshops and performing recitals in front of an iPad. She hopes the virtual work will continue for a while.In New York City, virtually everyone she knows is fully vaccinated. Some of her family members don't understand her decision. Still, for her, it's settled.She is afraid the vaccine could make her ear ringing worse, so she will not get a second dose."I just can't take that risk," she says. "As a musician, my ears are my life."She avoids crowded indoor spaces and large gatherings. She wears a mask whenever she's inside with others.The irony is that the very thing Moon is trying to protect — her career as a musician — is what's being held back by her decision not to get a second shot.Even before today, New York City had some of the strictest vaccine requirements in the country. As a freelance musician, Moon works with many organizations across the city, including as a teaching artist at both Lincoln Center and Carnegie Hall. She's watched as one by one, they've imposed vaccine mandates — for employees and also for audiences.Beata Moon is not looking for sympathy."Fortunately, I've had some virtual work, and not a lot has been going on in-person," she says.But she wants people to stop judging her — to stop making assumptions. She hopes people will replace judgment with curiosity.She also hopes there will be more research into natural immunity — what protection a prior COVID-19 infection may provide.And she wants a rethinking of the mandates, especially now that scientists saythis coronavirus may never go away."It's something that we have to learn to live with and deal with, and so we need a lot more nuance and flexibility," she says.It's a tough time to be making such an argument as new cases have hit record highs and more than 800,000 people in the U.S. alone have died from COVID-19. It also appears that things are headed in the other direction.New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, has said she intends to introduce legislation to change the definition of "fully vaccinated" to include boosters. With data showing that boosters dramatically increase protection from the omicron variant, it's an idea that's swiftly gaining traction nationwide.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Elissa NadwornyNeuroscientist and author Magdalena Bak-Maier shares her tips for how to stay well and practice self-care during a holiday season made more stressful by the rapidly spreading omicron variant.ELISSA NADWORNY, HOST:And unfortunately, the pandemic is showing no signs of slowing just yet. In fact, thanks to the rapidly spreading omicron variant and surging coronavirus cases, this holiday season may feel a lot like last holiday season. If you're feeling extra stressed this year, you're not alone. We've called up someone who has advice for those of us feeling the pandemic holiday blues. Magdalena Bak-Maier is a neuroscientist, wellness coach and author, and she joins us now from London.Magdalena Bak-Maier, welcome.MAGDALENA BAK-MAIER: Hello. Lovely to be with you.NADWORNY: So what is it about the winter holiday season that makes it such a hard time, even without a pandemic?BAK-MAIER: Well, Christmas, you know, is very known to psychologists for being a highly triggering sort of event, if for no other reason than because it tends to bring up a lot of family dynamics. It reminds us of our connection with our relatives, memories of people we might have potentially lost, and the stress of it being quite performative, as in, you know, we're asked to be jolly and happy and maybe put on masks of all of that or take part in things when maybe some of us kind of want to sit on the sidelines and not really be part of it. So there's an awful lot about Christmas in its own right that can be very loaded for quite a lot of us.NADWORNY: What can people do if they're feeling like this? Any tips or concrete steps for people who might be spending the next week more isolated than they'd like?BAK-MAIER: Yes. So when people are feeling helpless in any situation, if we can't do it alone, we should certainly reach out for help through any possible means and not find ourselves isolated and alone and trying to deal with these emotions on our own. On the other hand, there are short-term things that we can all do to help us feel far better, which is to think about the short term, as in, you know, many times, we catastrophize or think about these fearful situations that our minds can imagine, which are very large, and they can happen on a larger timescale. But oftentimes, what we have to really think about is, how am I going to make today be a really good day?So I would invite people to really think about, how do you construct the next 24 hours? How do you plan to make sure that you have some things you can look forward to and begin to take that control back and that sense of agency and really thinking about how you look after yourself. And that comfort can give your nervous system a better sense that, actually, you can survive the moment - and also looking back at different situations in your history where you might have overcome some difficult experiences, to fall back on the sense that, you know, if you were able to do that and were resilient in the past, then your own history suggests that you'll be able to get across whatever the next obstacle is as well.NADWORNY: You created a tool for self-care and productivity called the Grid. Can you tell us about that? And how can we use the Grid during this period to keep us well?BAK-MAIER: Yes, of course. Grid is a very simple two-by-two matrix. In the Grid, we have effectively four areas that people are invited to look after. And they are life, self-care, work and career. So the Grid simply really invites people to kind of make a table of, you know, four lines and say, what can you do today or this week or this month or this year that is good for your personal life? What can you do that's good for your work? Then what can you do to self-care? So how can you look after your emotional well-being, your physical well-being, your mental well-being, et cetera? And what can you do to give yourself a sense of meaning or purpose, which is under the career part? When we do not balance these four areas, we end up creating deficits that over time creates an imbalance in our nervous system in the way we perceive our levels of safety, connection and joy that creates a situation where we start to feel like we're not as well as we can be.NADWORNY: You've said that the Grid is, at least in part, a tool for productivity. But I have to ask, you know, for those of us feeling the fatigue of this year - the last two years, really - productivity might sound like a dirty word. Is there any room to be unproductive?BAK-MAIER: Absolutely. And, in fact, you know, what I have always thought about in terms of productivity has been more along the lines of meaningful productivity, very holistic productivity. And the idea of really being productive goes back to some of the good, wise, you know, sages of different centuries, to sort of say, how do we live our life with meaning in a way where we are looking after ourselves? - which is why the Grid has that whole quadrant for self-care. And that will mean different things to different people. So you could be productive by taking time out and ensuring you get enough sleep or that you take time away from people to actually be in solitude and recharge your batteries that way.NADWORNY: Why is self-care and the development of routines like this, like the Grid, so helpful in maintaining well-being, especially during times like this?BAK-MAIER: Well, what we know about routines is the fact that routines, from a neurological point of view, is something that we are - or our minds are able to do through the basal ganglia, to the sort of much more evolutionarily older parts of our brain. In other words, we don't have to think about them. So the more we can fall back on the routine, the less thinking is involved. And that's where routine behaviors become really sort of a bit of a safety net so that even if I find it really hard, I know that I get up. And I brush my teeth. And I make my bed. And I give myself a breakfast. And that's already a really good start, you know? And from then on, your brain develops cues from your actions. So as you're moving forward in the day, your mind is getting this cue like, hold on a second. I'm holding it. You know, I'm getting on with the day. And that reinforces a sort of positive loop of direct experience that we're showing up.NADWORNY: That was Magdalena Bak-Maier. She's a neuroscientist, author and wellness coach based in London. Magdalena Bak-Maier, thank you so much for being with us today.BAK-MAIER: It's my absolute pleasure. Thank you for having me. And I hope everyone can put a dose of extra self-care into their day.(SOUNDBITE OF FREE NATIONALS' "TIME (INSTUMENTAL)")Copyright © 2021 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Anya KamenetzClosures from COVID-19 have affected 1.6 billion children worldwide. Nearly two years into the pandemic, experts say the economic costs are in the trillions and the social costs are incalculable.ELISSA NADWORNY, HOST:Throughout the pandemic, data like daily case numbers, hospitalizations and deaths have helped public health officials make sense of COVID-19 and all the ways it's altered daily life. And we begin today's program with another figure, $17 trillion. That's how much the pandemic could cost children around the world in terms of lost lifetime earnings. The number comes from a new report by the United Nations and the World Bank. NPR's education correspondent Anya Kamenetz has been digging into this, and she joins us now.Hi, Anya.ANYA KAMENETZ, BYLINE: Hey, Elissa.NADWORNY: So $17 trillion - that's a lot of money. How did the researchers land on that number?KAMENETZ: Sure. So, as you know, in March 2020, schools closed not only here in the United States, but all over the world for 1.6 billion children. And obviously, that's a really big deal in richer countries, but especially it's a big deal in regions of the world that have been working hard in the last couple of decades to get children into formal education.So in this new report, the United Nations and the World Bank are estimating what those months and months of disruption might ultimately mean for these children. So closed schools combined with the economic crashes all around the world not only means lost learning, it means students driven into the workforce. And some of them are going to stay there. So that all translates to children learning fewer basic skills, which makes them less qualified for higher-waged jobs. And that is how they get that estimate of $17 trillion of lost wages potentially over the lifetimes of these children.NADWORNY: OK. And when you say basic skills, what exactly are you talking about?KAMENETZ: Right. So I was interested in this. UNESCO actually has a really simple benchmark, which is can a child, by the age of 10, read a sentence in their native language? And if they can't, they call that learning poverty. And they found that even before the pandemic, more than half of the children in low- and middle-income countries couldn't do that. And now learning poverty is projected to potentially reach up to 7 in 10 of those children, given that remote learning could not and did not reach everyone.NADWORNY: Wow. Did you get any more details about which children in particular could be impacted by this lost learning?KAMENETZ: Yeah. Unfortunately, Elissa, I mean, it tracks the inequities that we see all over the place. It's poorer children. It's children with disabilities. And it's girls. So UNICEF says that 10 million more girls around the world could be forced into child marriage in the next decade as one of the most unusual cascading impacts of the pandemic. And this is because not only have they likely dropped out of school, they may be orphaned, or their parents were driven further into poverty. And essentially, they've run out of options for survival. So this is really a human toll that they're talking about here.NADWORNY: So keeping in mind that these reports are projections, is there anything that can be done to lessen the impact of COVID on education outcomes?KAMENETZ: Yes, absolutely. This is really important. So there's three big recommendations by the authors of the report that actually apply to both rich and poor countries. One is invest more in COVID recovery dollars into education. You know, if you spend the money now, you may not have to cost the money later in terms of these lost earnings. Second is to innovate in teaching. So interestingly, coming out of the developing world, there's a lot of really positive research about a method called teaching at the right level, which is basically working one-on-one and in small groups to catch children up based on where they are at this moment. And the third point made by Borhene Chakroun, who's the director of the Division of Policies and Lifelong Learning Systems for UNESCO, is that based on everything we've seen, even with these new variants like omicron, we really need to avoid closing schools again, if at all possible. Chakroun said...BORHENE CHAKROUN: Our stance together with other partners has been you cannot open supermarket and leave the schools closed.KAMENETZ: So he says the rule should be to close schools last and open them first.NADWORNY: That's NPR education correspondent Anya Kamenetz. Thanks, Anya.KAMENETZ: Thank you, Elissa.Copyright © 2021 NPR.  All rights reserved.

The team had to withdraw from the Military Bowl because of the pandemic.For the second year in a row, college bowl games are being canceled as coronavirus case counts climb. Rosters are also depleted by injuries and players either opting out of games or transferring to other schools.On Tuesday, UCLA announced it would not participate in the San Diego County Credit Union Holiday Bowl game against NC State.The UCLA football team is unable to participate in tonight’s San Diego County Credit Union Holiday Bowl due to COVID-19 protocols within the Bruins’ program.pic.twitter.com/rHXEmGv9glOn Sunday, three schools announced that they wouldn't participate in bowl games: The University of Virginia Cavaliers dropped out of Wednesday's Wasabi Fenway Bowl "due to the number of COVID cases impacting its roster, preventing safe participation," the Fenway Bowl said in astatementannouncing the game's cancellation.The Virginia team was supposed to head to Boston on Christmas Day to play the Southern Methodist University Mustangs. But as they prepared for that date, some U.Va. players started showing symptoms consistent with COVID-19, U.Va. said in a statement. After those players tested positive for the virus, the rest of the team was tested on Christmas morning — and more players were found to have the virus."We are extremely disappointed the team will not be able to participate in the inaugural Fenway Bowl," Virginia Athletics Director Carla Williamssaidin a statement. The bowl would have been the last chance for outgoing coach Bronco Mendenhall to coach the team.Also Sunday, Military Bowl organizerssaidthe bowl game would be canceled due to a spate of positive coronavirus cases at Boston College, where more than 40 players were unavailable to play."This is not the way we wanted to see this season come to an end,"saidBoston College head football coach Jeff Haley. "We just do not have enough players to safely play a game."The Military Bowl, which would have pitted the Boston College Eagles against the East Carolina University Pirates, was scheduled to kick off Monday in Annapolis after a parade and festival. All of the events are now canceled.Late Sunday, the University of Miami announced that it wouldn't be able to field a team against Washington State in Friday's Sun Bowl in El Paso, Texas."We are extremely disappointed that our football team will be unable to participate in the 2021 Tony the Tiger Sun Bowl," Deputy Director of Athletics and Chief Operating Officer Jennifer Strawleysaid in a statement. "But due to the number of COVID-19 cases impacting our roster we do not have enough student-athletes to safely compete, and the health and safety of our student-athletes will always be our top priority."Washington State, which had arrived in El Paso on Sunday before Miami's announcement, said it still hoped to find an opponent for Friday's game."It is disappointing news that the University of Miami is unable to participate in the 2021 Tony the Tiger Sun Bowl,"the university said in a statement. "We will work with the Pac-12 Conference and the Sun Bowl Association to hopefully find a replacement opponent for the game."These are just the latest of several bowl games canceled as the omicron variant of the coronavirus overtakes the country. The University of Hawaii said Thursday that its team, the Rainbow Warriors,wouldn't competeagainst the Memphis Tigers. The EasyPost Hawaii Bowl had been scheduled for Friday.Also last week, Texas A&M bowed out of the Gator Bowl "due to a combination of COVID-19 issues within the Texas A&M football program, as well as season-ending injuries," the schoolsaid."We just don't have enough scholarship players available to field a team," Texas A&M head coach Jimbo Fisher said.But the Gator Bowl will go on with Rutgers University invited to replace Texas A&M in Jacksonville, Fla., where it will compete against Wake Forest University.The College Football Playoff management committee updated itspolicieslast week for the national championship and the Cotton Bowl, Fiesta Bowl, Orange Bowl and Peach Bowl, should any team be unable to compete in those games.During the playoff semifinals, a team that doesn't have enough players will forfeit and its opponent will advance to the national championship game in Indianapolis. The championship — currently scheduled for Jan. 10 — can be rescheduled as late as Jan. 14. At that point, any team unable to play will forfeit, leaving the other as the national champion.If neither team can play, the CFP said, "then the game shall be declared 'no contest' and the CFP National Championship shall be vacated for this season."Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

When Olson's son-in-law died in March after contracting COVID-19, she and her daughter had to grapple with more than just their sudden grief. They had to come up with money for a cremation. Even without a funeral, the bill came to nearly $2,000, a hefty sum that Olson initially covered.BOSTON — When Wanda Olson's son-in-law died in March after contracting COVID-19, she and her daughter had to grapple with more than just their sudden grief. They had to come up with money for a cremation.Even without a funeral, the bill came to nearly $2,000, a hefty sum that Olson initially covered. She and her daughter then learned of a federal program that reimburses families up to $9,000 for funeral costs for loved ones who died of COVID-19.Olson's daughter submitted an application to theFederal Emergency Management Agency, received a deposit by June and was able to reimburse her mother the $1,974."Had this not been available, we would have been paying the money ourselves," said Olson, 80, of Villa Rica, Georgia. "There wasn't any red tape. This was a very easy, well-handled process."As of Dec. 6, about 226,000 people had shared in the nearly $1.5 billion that FEMA has spent on funeral costs that occurred after Jan. 20, 2020, the date of the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in the U.S. With the nation's coronavirus death toll topping 800,000, it's clear that many families who are eligible for reimbursement have yet to take advantage of the funeral benefit.Olson's son-in-law was traveling a lot, working on air conditioning systems in theaters, restaurants and businesses, when he began feeling ill, she said. After a few days at home, he went to the hospital and was put on a ventilator. He died several weeks later."He could never overcome it," Olson said.To be eligible for reimbursement, death certificates for those who died after May 16, 2020, must indicate that the death was attributed to COVID-19.For deaths that occurred in the early months of the pandemic — from Jan. 20 to May 16, 2020 — death certificates must be accompanied with a signed statement from a medical examiner, coroner or the certifying official listed on the certificate indicating that COVID-19 was the cause or a contributing cause of death.The percentage of individuals who have been reimbursed varies dramatically from state to state — from nearly 40% in North Carolina and Maryland to fewer than 15% in Idaho and Oregon, according to state-by-state data compiled by FEMA.While the reimbursement must go directly to individuals, some funeral directors have taken on the task of informing grieving families of the benefit.After the benefit was first announced, David Shipper, owner of the Sunset Funeral Home, Cremation Center & Cemetery in Evansville, Ind., took out ads to let people know that help was available if they qualified."Nine thousand dollars — that's a lot of money. We wanted to find a way to tell people about it," he said. "We stopped advertising some time ago, but when we have a new family with a death from COVID, we tell them about the program."Workers at the home will sit down with families, gather the needed paperwork, contact FEMA on the phone and help walk them through the process if they ask, he said.Many families may simply be unaware of the benefit, but others may opt against seeking the cash out of reluctance to revisit the pain of the death, Shipper said. He said the better time to seek the help is when planning the funeral."They're much more likely to take advantage right then than if they've already spent the money and don't want to open it up again," Shipper said.The largest states account for some of the biggest shares of the FEMA reimbursement money.The program has paid out more than 21,000 reimbursements in California and Texas, which have both reported more than 74,000 COVID-19 deaths. Residents applied for more than $141 million in each state.The fewest number of reimbursements have occurred in Vermont, where 123 people were awarded a total of about $704,000.Expenses covered under the FEMA program include funeral services, cremation and interment, as well as the costs for caskets or urns, burial plots or cremation niches, markers or headstones, transportation or transfer of remains, clergy or officiant services, and the use of funeral home equipment or staff.The program has been funded using federal stimulus funds, and money remains available. No online applications are allowed.After all required documents are received and verified, it typically takes fewer than 30 days to determine if an individual is eligible, according to FEMA. Once eligibility is confirmed, applicants who request direct deposit may receive the money in a matter of days. It may take longer for applicants who request a check.The reimbursement is one way of helping ease the emotional and financial burden that the pandemic has wreaked on communities across the country according to Ellen Wynn McBrayer, president of Jones-Wynn Funeral Homes & Crematory in Villa Rica.She recalled one woman who lost her mother, husband and one of her children to the disease in the span of six months. One of the workers at the funeral home also succumbed to the virus."To have to help a grieving family is hard on a normal day, but to see so many deaths," she said. "COVID has just broken a lot of hearts and taken a lot of lives."Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

Members of the group are seen here at a news conference to introduce their single "Butter," in May. They are, from left to right: V, Suga, Jin, Jungkook, RM, Jimin, and J-Hope.SEOUL, South Korea — Three members of the K-pop superstar group BTS have been infected with the coronavirus after returning from abroad, their management agency said.RM and Jin were diagnosed with COVID-19 on Saturday evening, the Big Hit Music agency said in a statement. It earlier said another member, Suga, tested positive for the virus on Friday.All three took their second jabs in August, the agency said.BTS is a seven-member boyband. The four other members are J-Hope, Jungkook, V and Jimin.According to the agency, RM has exhibited no particular symptoms while Jin is showing mild symptoms including light fever and is undergoing self-treatment at home. The agency said Friday that Suga wasn't exhibiting symptoms and was administering self-care at home in accordance with the guidelines of the health authorities.RM had tested negative after returning from the United States earlier this month following his personal schedule there. But he was later diagnosed with the virus ahead of his scheduled release from self-quarantine, the agency said.After returning to South Korea this month, Jin underwent PCR tests twice — upon arrival and later before his release from self-quarantine — and tested negative both times. But he had flu-like symptoms on Saturday afternoon before he took another PCR test that came back positive, the agency said. Media reports said he also had traveled to the U.S.Suga, who has had a number of personal engagements in the United States during the band's official time off, was diagnosed with COVID-19 during quarantine after returning from the U.S., the agency said.The agency said it'll continue to provide support for the three members for their speedy recovery. It said it will cooperate with the requests and guidelines of the South Korean health authorities.Since their debut in 2013, BTS has garnered global recognition for their self-produced music and activism, which includes giving a speech at the United Nations and publicly calling out anti-Asian racism.BTS was named artist of the year and favorite pop duo or group, and also won the favorite pop song award for "Butter" at the American Music Awards in November.In October, the group's collaboration with British rock band Coldplay, "My Universe," hit No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100. It was BTS' sixth Hot 100 No. 1.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Brian MannNew York Gov. Kathy Hochul shortened the quarantine period for many essential workers even as infections have surged because of the omicron variant.Mary Altaffer/APhide captionNew York Gov. Kathy Hochul shortened the quarantine period for many essential workers even as infections have surged because of the omicron variant.New York Gov. Kathy Hochul says most of the state's essential workers can return to work just five days after a positive coronavirus test if they're fully vaccinated and meet other safety standards.Previously, workers were required to stay away from their jobs for at least 10 days.Hochul said Friday thechange in quarantine guidelineswill make it easier to maintain "critical services that New Yorkers need, healthcare, transportation, grocery stores."The policy shift will affect employees in a wide range of industries, from pharmacies and food processing plants to hospitals and taxi fleets.The governor made the announcement as infections have surged nationwide because of the omicron variant.In New York state, officials said the number of daily infections rose dramatically in recent days, up from roughly 22,000 on Tuesday to more than 44,000 on Thursday.During a briefing Christmas Eve, Hochul also pointed to data suggesting the latest COVID strain may cause less severe infections."Positive cases don't mean you're too sick [to work] and require hospitalization," she said. "We want to make sure our critical workforce ... can get back."In a statement, New York's acting Health Commissioner Dr. Mary Bassett said the impact of the winter omicron surge on the workforce "is already being felt.""A reduction of isolation from 10 days to 5 days is sensible guidance and in alignment with the recent CDC guidance for health workers," Bassett said.On Thursday, theCenters for Disease Control and Prevention issued new national guidanceallowing workers with COVID-19 to return to work after 7 days of quarantine, with a new negative test."[T]hat isolation time can be cut further if there are staffing shortages," the CDC saidin a statement.Officials in New York chose to cut the quarantine period even further — setting the state guideline at 5 days rather than 7.  They also said workers returning to the job do not need to be retested.Employees do, however, have to be fully vaccinated and wear a mask on the job site. They also have to be asymptomatic or "mildly symptomatic," with no fever for 72 hours.During her briefing, Hochul said rising hospitalization rates are also putting additional strain on health care workers.  She voiced sorrow for those who've lost loved ones to the pandemic during the holiday season."Our hearts go out to their family members just on the verge of this beautiful holiday," Hochul said. "To know there's going to be an empty seat at the table has to be incredibly painful."Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

The offer of shots was an expression of "care for one's neighbor" that was consistent with the message of Christmas, cathedral provost Guido Assmann told the DPA news agency.Around the world, people weary from nearly two years of lockdowns and other restrictions searched for ways to safely enjoy holiday rituals."We can't let the virus take our lives from us when we're healthy," said Rosalia Lopes, a retired Portuguese government worker who was doing some last-minute shopping in the coastal town of Cascais.She said she and her family were exhausted by the pandemic and determined to go ahead with their celebrations with the help of vaccines and booster shots, rapid home tests and mask-wearing in public. She planned a traditional Portuguese Christmas Eve dinner of baked cod.In New York City, where omicron has spread widely, people waited in long lines to get tested, many doing so as a precaution before traveling to reunite with family.Brianna Sultan and her daughter Ava, 8, spent Friday in one of those long lines waiting for a test after they got word of another infection at school."It's a terrible way to be spending Christmas Eve," Sultan said after more than two hours in line and as the chill deepened into the evening in New York City's Harlem neighborhood. "It's terrible that we can't see our families because this COVID strain is coming back up again."Holiday travel was dealt a blow when major airlinescanceled hundreds of flightsamid staffing shortages largely tied to omicron.Sadia Reins arrived in New York City from Alexandria, Virginia, on Friday to be with with her 75-year-old mother. Reins said the two haven't spent Christmas together in two years, and despite the risks in traveling during the outbreak, she couldn't bear to be apart from her mother again this year.Members of the winter swimming club "Pirrlliepausen" go into Lake Senftenberg, which is four degrees cold (39 Farenheit) for their traditional Christmas swim, in Seftenberg, Germany, on Friday.Bernd W'stneck/dpa via APhide captionMembers of the winter swimming club "Pirrlliepausen" go into Lake Senftenberg, which is four degrees cold (39 Farenheit) for their traditional Christmas swim, in Seftenberg, Germany, on Friday."We're going to cry," she said, adding: "We talk on the phone all the time, but it's not the same as looking at someone."In Britain, where the coronavirus variant is ripping through the population, some houses of worship hoped to press on.At St. Paul's Old Ford, an Anglican church in East London, priests planned to hold services on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. But to protect parishioners, the church called off its Nativity play."You might have to cancel the service, but you can't cancel Christmas,'' said the Rev. April Keech, an associate priest. "You can't stop love. Love still stands."Numerous churches in the U.S. canceled in-person services, including Washington National Cathedral in the nation's capital and historic Old South Church in Boston. Others planned outdoor celebrations or a mix of online and in-person worship.In Rome, a maskless Pope Franciscelebrated Christmas Eve Massbefore an estimated 2,000 people in St. Peter's Basilica, where admission was limited and worshippers had to wear masks.While the number of faithful was far more than the 200 allowed in last year, it was a fraction of the 20,000 the basilica can seat. Before the pandemic, St. Peter's was routinely packed for midnight Mass.Women wearing masks to curb the spread of the coronavirus work on decorations to celebrate Christmas at a church in Bali, Indonesia, on Friday.Firdia Lisnawati/APhide captionWomen wearing masks to curb the spread of the coronavirus work on decorations to celebrate Christmas at a church in Bali, Indonesia, on Friday.In Germany, churchgoers faced a thicket of health restrictions and limits on attendance. Some had to show proof of vaccination or testing.Frankfurt's cathedral, which can hold 1,200 people, offered only 137 socially distanced spaces, all of which were booked days in advance. Singing was allowed only through masks.People in the Netherlands tried to make the best of the holiday, despite living under one of the strictest lockdowns in Europe. All nonessential shops were closed, including bars and restaurants, and home visits were limited to two people per day, four on Christmas."We are just meeting with some small groups of family for the next few days," Marloes Jansen, who was waiting in line to buy the traditional Dutch kerststol, a Christmas bread with fruits and nuts.A glitch in a computerized appointment system prevented scores of people from scheduling COVID-19 tests and undermined the government's efforts to administer booster shots in a country already lagging far behind its neighbors.In France, some visited loved ones in the hospital. In the Mediterranean city of Marseille, the intensive care unit at La Timone Hospital has been taking in more and more COVID-19 patients in recent days.Amelie Khayat has been paying daily visits to her husband, Ludo, 41, who is recovering from spending 24 days in a coma and on a breathing machine.They touched their heads together as she sat on his bed, and now that he is strong enough to stand, he got up to give her a farewell hug, as a medical worker put final decorations on the ICU Christmas tree.People gather around illuminated Christmas decorations on Christmas Eve in Seoul, South Korea.Ahn Young-joon/APhide captionPeople gather around illuminated Christmas decorations on Christmas Eve in Seoul, South Korea.Parisians lined up at chocolate shops, farmers' markets and testing centers. France has posted record numbers of daily COVID-19 infections, and hospitalizations have been rising, but the government has held off on imposing curfews or closings during the holidays."It does affect our enthusiasm to celebrate Christmas. It does makes us a bit sad. But at least we are sure not to contaminate or get contaminated. We will all do the test in our family," said Fabienne Maksimovic, 55, as she waited in line at a pharmacy in Paris to get tested.In Antwerp, Belgium, Christmas trees hung upside down from windows in a protest against the closing of cultural venues.In Bethlehem, the scene was much more festive than it was a year ago, when musicians marched through empty streets. This year, hundreds of people gathered in Manger Square as bagpipe-and-drum units streamed through.Before the pandemic, Bethlehem would host thousands of Christian pilgrims from around the world. The lack of visitors has hit the city's hotels, restaurants and gift shops especially hard.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
The Associated PressPope Francis unveils a statue of Baby Jesus as he celebrates Christmas Eve Mass at St. Peter's Basilica, at the Vatican, on Friday.Alessandra Tarantino/APhide captionPope Francis unveils a statue of Baby Jesus as he celebrates Christmas Eve Mass at St. Peter's Basilica, at the Vatican, on Friday.ROME — Pope Francis celebrated Christmas Eve Mass before an estimated 2,000 people in St. Peter's Basilica on Friday, going ahead with the service despite the resurgence in COVID-19 cases that has prompted a new vaccine mandate for Vatican employees.A maskless Francis processed down the central aisle as the Sistine Chapel choir sang "Noel," kicking off the Vatican's Christmas holiday that commemorates the birth of Jesus in a manger in Bethlehem. He remained maskless throughout the service.In his homily, Francis urged the faithful to focus on the "littleness" of Jesus, and remember that he came into the world poor, without even a proper crib."That is where God is, in littleness," Francis said. "This is the message: God does not rise up in grandeur, but lowers himself into littleness. Littleness is the path that he chose to draw near to us, to touch our hearts, to save us and to bring us back to what really matters."Attendance on Friday was limited to about 2,000 people, far more than the 200 allowed in 2020 when Italy was in a full Christmas lockdown. But the number is a fraction of the capacity of St. Peter's, which can seat up to 20,000 and in pre-pandemic times would be packed for one of the most popular Vatican liturgies of the year.A Swiss Guard stands as Pope Francis celebrates Christmas Eve Mass at St. Peter's Basilica.Alessandra Tarantino/APhide captionA Swiss Guard stands as Pope Francis celebrates Christmas Eve Mass at St. Peter's Basilica.The "Midnight Mass" actually began at 7:30 p.m., a nod to the 85-year-old pope's endurance and a hold-over from last year, when the service had to end before Italy's nationwide COVID-19 curfew.No curfew is in place this year, but cases this week have surged even beyond 2020 levels. For the second day in a row, Italy on Friday set a new pandemic daily record with 50,599 new cases. Another 141 people died, bringing Italy's official death toll to 136,386.With the arrival of the omicron variant in Italy, the Vatican secretary of state on Thursday imposed a new vaccine mandate on all Vatican staff, extending it to all employees except those who have recovered from the coronavirus. Previously, only employees who dealt with the public directly had to be vaccinated, such as staff at the Vatican Museums and the Swiss Guards, while others could access their offices with regular testing.The mandate does not apply to the faithful attending Mass, but they are required to wear masks. Those attending Friday's Mass, and the priests, bishops and cardinals concelebrating it, all wore masks. Francis, who is missing part of one lung and had intestinal surgery in July, has largely eschewed masks, even when greeting prelates and the general public.Pope Francis celebrates Christmas Eve Mass, going ahead with the service despite the resurgence in COVID-19 cases.Alessandra Tarantino/APhide captionPope Francis celebrates Christmas Eve Mass, going ahead with the service despite the resurgence in COVID-19 cases."I'm not worried because first of all I have a mask on, and I've had my third dose so I feel relaxed," said Franco Pasquali, a Rome resident attending the service. "The problem is those who don't vaccinate, that's all."Francis is believed to have received the third booster shot, as has emeritus Pope Benedict XVI. Francis has said vaccination is an "act of love" and he has called for wealthier countries to provide the shots to the developing world.Among those attending the Mass was Melissa Helland, an American tourist visiting Rome with her family."This is the first time in the last two years that we've been able to gather both as a family and to attend Mass because of the pandemic, so we are very excited and grateful," she said before the service began.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

After Thanksgiving, the family all had breakthrough COVID cases, resulting in a couple weeks spent at home. The trampoline served as a distraction for the kids, Farmer says.Erica Calhoun for NPRhide captionBlake Farmer plays with his kids, Louisa, 2, and Turner, 8, on the trampoline in their backyard in Nashville, Tenn. After Thanksgiving, the family all had breakthrough COVID cases, resulting in a couple weeks spent at home. The trampoline served as a distraction for the kids, Farmer says.When our 2-year-old tested positive for COVID-19 after Thanksgiving, we knew it would put our mostly vaccinated household to the test — because the only place she seems to cough or sneeze is in her parents' faces.And if you're thinking, "but couldn't she just wear a mask?" then you haven't been raising a toddler during the pandemic.Breakthrough experiences are becoming more common as our vaccine protection wanes, our pandemic precautions fade and the variants become more prevalent and more evasive.Our family's saga began the Monday after Thanksgiving. And it left us with a handful of questions that I'll try to answer in the hopes that our experience may help others navigate the December holidays.As the boys in my 8-year-old's Cub Scout den fumbled around with a compass in a dark church parking lot, I received a text from Moriah, my wife of 16 years."You probably need to come home ... now," she wrote. An 11-year-old, a cousin, who was at our house for Thanksgiving, had tested positive for COVID-19."[Expletive]," I thought.Moriah's first thought: "I'm a bad person. What was I thinking, inviting 20 people from Texas and Tennessee over to the house?"As a health care journalist what went through my mind was: "This will be really interesting to see who gets sick."Ironically, this transmission event may have begun because our extended family members were trying tomaximizethe power of the vaccines. The presumed source of infection, the 11-year-old distant cousin, could theoretically have gotten a dose of the Pfizer vaccine for 5- to 11-year-olds before Thanksgiving.But the cousin was on the cusp of turning 12, so her mother had decided to wait until her daughter's birthday at the end of November. At that point, she would qualify for the bigger adult dose of the COVID-19 vaccine.That's areasonable thought, though it did remind me of some prescient words fromDr. James Hildreth, president and CEO of Meharry Medical College in Nashville. Whenever reporters asked him whether people should wait for the most effective vaccine, he responded with advice that became his mantra: The best COVID-19 vaccine is the one you can get right away.In our household, our immediate concern was our unvaccinated 2-year-old, Louisa. But the next morning we also tested Turner, the 8-year-old. He had just received his second dose of the pediatric Pfizer vaccine the day before and was actually feeling a tad puny.Here in Nashville, it's still remarkably easy to get a free PCR test with no appointment. And that night Turner's results arrived by email — "virus detected."At that point we now had two little COVID-19 patients. Louisa, whom we call "Lou," was snotty and coughing. But neither kid had a fever.We alerted their schools. Fortunately, Turner's elementary in Metro Nashville Public Schools strictly enforces a mask requirement — despite the Tennessee legislature effectivelyoutlawingmask mandates. So no one else had to quarantine. He was sent home to isolate for 10 days.But Lou's preschool class got the dreaded email: Sorry parents, class is out for at least a week.Moriah felt guilt and shame. My take was more philosophical: Sorry, but this is just life in the age of COVID.As for the two of us, we were putting our own vaccines to the test. I've been fully Pfizer'd since mid-April. Moriah had snagged Moderna shot a few weeks before me. Neither of us had made time yet to get the booster, though we were planning on it. But Moriah probably did have a little more protection than me, since she also had antibodies after falling ill with a pretty mean case of COVID-19 back in 2020.By the first weekend after Thanksgiving, everyone in our house was feeling rather sick of one another, but otherwise we were healthy. Still, I decided to get myself tested, since I was supposed to go to the radio station for an on-air fundraising drive.And to my surprise, I was positive.I had no symptoms that I noticed, though I began thinking maybe my sniffer was a little off. Could have been my imagination. But at least I no longer had to pretend I was keeping my distance from my COVID-ridden kids.Blake and Moriah Farmer and two kids, Turner, 8, and Louisa, 2, hang out in the backyard of their home in Nashville. After a family gathering for Thanksgiving, Louisa contracted COVID-19 and the rest of the family were struck with breakthrough cases, leaving the four to return to the days when everyone stayed inside a bubble.Erica Calhoun for NPRhide captionBlake and Moriah Farmer and two kids, Turner, 8, and Louisa, 2, hang out in the backyard of their home in Nashville. After a family gathering for Thanksgiving, Louisa contracted COVID-19 and the rest of the family were struck with breakthrough cases, leaving the four to return to the days when everyone stayed inside a bubble.In the end, we got through this unexpected holiday outbreak just fine, as a family. My wife and I are fortunate in that we can work from home. We had to lean on screen time more than we would have liked. The pandemic gift of a trampoline came in especially handy at this time, to keep the kids sane and somewhat exercised.We served our isolation time and resumed our normal routines on Dec. 13. We got ourselves PCR tests just to be sure, and they came back negative. We sent the kids back to school for a few more days before Christmas break. And that concluded our holiday-time brush with COVID-19.But the experience left me with some questions, which I spent some time trying to answer.Having nearly 20 people under one roof for a few days is a risk. We knew all the adults were vaccinated. And the grandparents, who had the highest risk of severe illness, were boosted. The kids who came to our house were a mixed bunch as far as their vaccine status.In hindsight, it would have been a good idea if everyone had taken rapid tests just before gathering. Epidemiologistssayit doesn't eliminate the risk of transmission, but it does give you a window of lower risk. At the same time, if I'm being honest, there was a part of me that just didn't want to know. We had already called off Thanksgiving at the last minute in 2020 because of a local surge, and frankly, we missed gathering as a family.The current official advice from the Biden administration, as Christmas approaches, doesn't map easily onto the situation we faced.President Biden said during a speech about omicron, on Dec. 21:"I know some Americans are wondering if you can safely celebrate the holidays with your family and friends. The answer is yes, you can, if you and those you celebrate with are vaccinated, particularly if you've gotten your booster shot" and, he added, if you "follow the precautions that we all know well."But how would that apply to our family, with its mix of vaccinated adults, and unvaccinated children?CDC director Dr. Rochelle Walensky brought some clarity the following day, when sheadvisedthat Americans to "please get vaccinated, get boosted, wear a mask in public indoor settings, and take a COVID-19 test before gathering with others."Taking those rapid tests would indeed have been a good idea, in retrospect, but it's unclear with everyone in our party would have been able to get their hands on those tests. Plus, they're not free. Compared with in Europe, availability of the tests has been erratic in the U.S., and recently, many Americans havecomplainedabout being unable to find them.It sure seems like they did. The only person with symptoms in our house was the unvaccinated toddler. While my infection qualified as a "breakthrough" case, the vaccine did its job and kept me from becoming ill, or even feeling ill. It appears that even our 8-year-old, who at Thanksgiving time had only received one of his two pediatric shots, benefited from protection.This is the only part of the story that sort of scares me. If we hadn't been alerted, we never would have thought about getting tested. Even little Lou just had what I would consider "the crud." Her symptoms didn't seem COVID-like. No one ever had a fever. Asymptomatic cases tend not to spread the virus as much as those that involve lots of coughing and sneezing everywhere. But if we hadn't been alerted about the exposure, we certainly could have silently infected many more people, possibly someone vulnerable to severe infection.The officialrecommendationof the CDC is to get a booster as soon as symptoms clear up. However, there's some thought among infectious disease experts that it could be ideal to wait even longer, allowing the new antibodies created by a breakthrough infection to "mature."But as with many things in this pandemic, the science is still emerging. The official advice remains: Get a booster six months after the second vaccine dose. If you happen to be sick with a breakthrough infection at the time, then wait a little longer until symptoms disappear. There's no way of being absolutely sure that an infection will be mild, like ours. Any COVID-19 infection, even a breakthrough, can potentially become quite serious, or even fatal, and boosting is the best way to prevent infections.We haven't gotten the booster yet, but will.I pray not for much longer. Life during this pandemic asks a lot of us, even when we follow the science and get vaccinated. By contrast, we don't go to get tested for the flu, after we learn we've been around someone who had the flu. For many families, there are real economic consequences to holing up for two weeks. And it's psychologically burdensome. I can't blame people for going on about their business if they're vaccinated and feel fine and deciding to see what happens after a possible exposure, rather than seek out a test.But COVID-19 is also quite different from the flu. COVID-19 is still killing, on average, more than 1,200 Americans a day. So we have to treat it differently and do what we can to protect those around us.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Jennifer LuddenA Lufthansa flight arrives at Miami International Airport last month. The German airline, along with United and Delta, reported canceling dozens of Christmas Eve departures as illnesses tied to the omicron variant of COVID-19 take a toll on flight crew.Lynne Sladky/APhide captionA Lufthansa flight arrives at Miami International Airport last month. The German airline, along with United and Delta, reported canceling dozens of Christmas Eve departures as illnesses tied to the omicron variant of COVID-19 take a toll on flight crew.As if this second holiday season of the pandemic wasn't hard enough, many looking forward to seeing family and friends for Christmas were informed at the last minute that theirflights had been canceled. A main reason is that the highly contagious omicron variant of coronavirus has left airlines short-staffed."The nationwide spike in Omicron cases this week has had a direct impact on our flight crews and the people who run our operation," said United Airlines in a statement to NPR.The airline said it had canceled more than 175 flights for Friday and 69 on Saturday, and was notifying customers before they arrived at the airport. "We're sorry for the disruption and are working hard to rebook as many people as possible and get them on their way for the holidays."Likewise, Delta Air Lines canceled around 145 flights for Friday. It said some were due to potential bad weather, but also noted the impact of the omicron variant on its crews."Delta teams have exhausted all options and resources — including rerouting and substitutions of aircraft and crews to cover scheduled flying," Delta said in a statement to NPR. "We apologize to our customers for the delay in their holiday travel plans."Delta said it was also working to rebook travelers.Brianne Armstrong of San Antonio says she hit "crisis mode" when she saw a cancellation text from United Airlines at 2:30 am, just as she was getting ready for her 6:15 am flight to the Dominican Republic.She tells NPR that after postponing a trip to Amsterdam in the fall and then canceling it altogether last week due to coronavirus, she pivoted to the Dominican Republic — mostly because it had few COVID-19 restrictions. Now Armstrong is rebooked on a Christmas Day flight and is hoping that won't get canceled, too.Armstrong wonders if, after nearly two years of pandemic, a shift is needed so every new variant doesn't pose another crisis. "How do we live with this, how do we plan for the future of this?" she says. "Are we being proactive, or are we being reactive to every time there's a new variant?"According toFlightaware, nearly 3,400 flights were canceled worldwide on Friday and Saturday. While more than half of the cancellations came from Chinese airlines, about 20% were from U.S.-based carriers.Germany-based Lufthansa alsocanceled a dozen transatlantic flightsciting a "massive rise" in sick leave, though the airline said it couldn't confirm whether that was related to COVID-19.On Thursday, Airlines for America (A4A), a lobby group for airlines,wrote CDCdirector Rochelle Walensky asking for changes that could ease staffing shortages. The letter sayscurrent guidelinescall for 10 days of isolation for flight crew. But A4A wants that to be shortened to 5 days from the onset of symptoms for those who experience a breakthrough infection."Current medical data suggests that Omicron is 25% to 50% more contagious, but likely less virulent and milder symptoms particularly among people who are fully vaccinated," the lobby group wrote, noting that the latest variant seems to have a shorter incubation period and infectious period for vaccinated individuals.On Thursday the U.S. shortened COVID-19 isolation rules forhealth care workersonly.The holiday cancellations are just the latest challenge for an airline industryonly beginning to recoverfrom the Thanksgiving holiday — its busiest week since the pandemic began. To accommodate the surge in Christmas travelers, some airlines had offered employees incentive pay to work extra hours or not call in sick.Despite the ongoing omicron-fueled COVID-19 surge, the Transportation Security Administration said it expected to screen some 30 million passengers from Dec. 20 through Jan. 3. That compares to nearly 44 million during the same period prior to the pandemic.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Fran KritzEach week, we answer frequently asked questions about life during the coronavirus crisis. If you have a question you'd like us to consider for a future post, email us atgoatsandsoda@npr.orgwith the subject line: "Weekly Coronavirus Questions." See an archive of our FAQshere.I hear a lot of talk in the news these days about the omicron variant and the kind of disease it might cause: mild, moderate, severe. Could you explain those terms?As the omicron variant spreads around the globe, everyone wants to know: Will it cause mainly mild disease? Moderate? Severe?Early studies suggest that many people could have asymptomatic or mild cases rather than severe, in part because many more people are now vaccinated or have had previous disease. There's not yet enough data for a definitive answer.And then there's the question of what exactly "mild," "moderate" and "severe" mean vis-a-vis COVID.It turns out that question isn't so easy to answer. That's because doctors and patients have different concerns when assessing COVID.Doctors think in terms of how your lungs and other organs are doing and what treatments might be required."SARS-CoV-2 is a respiratory virus that causes COVID, and the designations refer largely to how well a patient's lungs are able to oxygenate and what treatment is necessary to keep the illness from progressing," says Stanford University infectious disease physicianDr. Abraar Karan."So when we move from mild to severe, we mean how easy or how difficult is it for you to breathe and maintain certain oxygen levels in your blood, and what treatments, if any, should we be using."Patients, meanwhile, think in terms of how horrible they might feel. This is an important distinction because some patients can have very low oxygen levels without many other symptoms or could have bad symptoms such as high fever and a painful headache but have normal oxygen levels.So what does a mild case look like? A mild case could mean barely any symptoms and a quick return to feeling normal. But so-called mild cases aren't always ... well, mild. The National Institutes of Health guidelines for treatment categorize mild COVID as" [i]ndividuals who have any of the various signs and symptoms of COVID-19 (e.g., fever, cough, sore throat, malaise, headache, muscle pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, loss of taste and smell) but who do not have shortness of breath, dyspnea (difficult or labored breathing), or abnormal chest imaging.""At board of health meetings I've heard discussions of people designated as 'mild' but they couldn't get out of bed for three days," saysShira Doron,a hospital epidemiologist at Tufts Medical Center in Boston.Indeed, NPR reporter Will Stone had a case of COVID that would be classified as "mild" by the guidelines that Dr. Karan cites. And here'sStone's self-report:"Fatigue had enveloped me like a weighted blanket...[n]ext, a headache clamped down on the back of my skull. Then my eyeballs started to ache. And soon enough, everything tasted like nothing...It was a miserable five days. My legs and arms ached, my fever crept up to 103 and every few hours of sleep would leave my sheets drenched in sweat."Not exactly what you think of when you hear the word "mild."As for moderate, patients in that category would experience shortness of breath or difficulty breathing. If you're using a device called a pulse oximeter to monitor your breathing, you should seek medical attention if the concentration of oxygen in your blood falls below 94%.To make matters more complicated, the World Health Organization updated its descriptors in November — and they're different than those used by NIH. Rather than mild, moderate, and severe, WHO uses the terms "non-severe" "severe" and "critical." It defines non-severe as "absence of signs of severe or critical disease." Critical disease covers individuals who have respiratory failure, septic shock and/or multiple organ dysfunction.So what's a patient to do?First off, Karan urges that anyone with symptoms get tested to see if it's actually COVID-19 you have. It is flu season and other viral and bacterial infections are circulating. If you don't have COVID and your symptoms worsen, you might benefit from a targeted therapy for what you do have, such as a flu antiviral or an antibiotic.And perhaps you shouldn't worry about figuring out the right adjective for your case, suggests Dr.William Schaffner, professor of medicine at Vanderbilt University and medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases. It's more important to alert your physician to what you're experiencing, he says."Be very specific about symptoms," says Schaffner, "including temperature, any difficulty breathing and your oxygen saturation rate if you are using a pulse oximeter. We need these benchmarks to put people and their doctors on alert that symptoms could be progressing and they need to be seen. And always tell the doctor if you — or someone with you — just have this feeling that things are going south."One more note on the subject of COVID terminology. Dr.Waafa El-Sadr, chair of global health at the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University, has another description she'd like to see made more precise: "breakthrough infections." That's what cases are COVID are called in people who are fully vaccinated — and in some cases boosted."We should be saying post-vaccination infections instead," says El-Sadr. "Breakthrough implies the vaccine has failed, when we knew from day one that these vaccines were never expected to protect 100% from developing infections. What they do is decrease the risk of getting infected and of hospitalization."El Sadr says that just when we need unvaccinated people to go ahead and get their shots, "the term breakthrough may be undermining the importance of being vaccinated and boosted."Fran Kritz is a health policy reporter based in Washington, D.C., who has contributed toThe Washington Postand Kaiser Health News.

New York City, which was initially overwhelmed by the pandemic, has once again seen case numbers surge as the new omicron variant becomes dominant.Spencer Platt/Getty Imageshide captionPeople wait in long lines in Times Square to get tested for COVID-19 on Monday. New York City, which was initially overwhelmed by the pandemic, has once again seen case numbers surge as the new omicron variant becomes dominant.Holiday travel, family gatherings and the rapid surge of new coronavirus cases triggered by the omicron variant, are driving huge demand for COVID-19 tests, leaving people scrambling as they prepare to celebrate Christmas and New Year's.The result so far has been around-the-block lines at testing sites andshortagesof at-home tests at drug stores. And many Americans are facing the possibility that they'll have to scrap their plans altogether, as the number of testing opportunities dwindles ahead of the holidays."Oh my God. It's just overwhelming," Sheryl Malone,told NPR member station WKSUin Ohio.Malone was trying to get tested on Wednesday after she said she was exposed to COVID-19 at work. She said she'd exhausted all other options before joining the long queue. She'd gone on an unsuccessful hunt for for an at-home test kit at local drug stores. She'd also tried to make an appointment with her doctor and at pharmacies, but that didn't work either."Their appointments are so far off," she said, explaining how she'd ended up in line at a Cleveland testing facility half an hour before it opened.National, state and local leaders are trying to respond to the current crush of demand, but aid may come too late.Cars line up at a drive-thru COVID-19 testing site at Miami's Tropical Park on Wednesday.Joe Raedle/Getty Imageshide captionCars line up at a drive-thru COVID-19 testing site at Miami's Tropical Park on Wednesday.The Biden administration, which has come under pressure for not increasing widespread availability of at-home tests, on Tuesdayrolled out a planto set up federal testing across the country. President Biden also said the government would buy a half-billion at-home COVID test kits and mail them to people who want them. But deliveries won't start until January.The hyper-contagious omicron variant has led to record-high number of cases for New York state, and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio has said the city is planning toincrease the number of testing sites by the end of this week. Gov. Kathy Hochul alsoannouncedon Tuesday that the city will begin offering testing at two MTA stations as soon as Monday and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will operate three new mobile units across the city.In California, Gov.

The Associated PressThe 2022 sign that will be lit on top of a building on New Year's Eve is displayed in Times Square, New York, Monday, Dec. 20, 2021.Seth Wenig/APhide captionThe 2022 sign that will be lit on top of a building on New Year's Eve is displayed in Times Square, New York, Monday, Dec. 20, 2021.NEW YORK — Revelers will still ring in the new year in New York's Times Square next week, there just won't be as many of them as usual under new restrictions announced Thursday as the city grapples with a spike in COVID-19 cases.Viewing areas that normally accommodate about 58,000 people will be limited to about 15,000 to allow for more distancing, and everyone in attendance must show proof of vaccination and wear a mask, Mayor Bill de Blasio said in a news release announcing the changes."There is a lot to celebrate and these additional safety measures will keep the fully vaccinated crowd safe and healthy as we ring in the New Year," de Blasio said, noting the city's success in getting residents vaccinated while also keeping businesses open.The added precautions for New Year's Eve in Times Square were spurred by the rapid spread of the omicron variant in the Big Apple, where lines for testing have snaked around blocks in recent days.On Wednesday, the city set yet another one-day testing record with 22,808 new cases, though a true comparison to the number of cases during the initial COVID-19 surge in spring 2020 is impossible because tests were very limited at the time.Because of vaccinations, hospitalizations and deaths from the current surge are far fewer than at the pandemic's height.The new wave of cases has led to the cancellation of concerts, sporting events and Broadway shows, but de Blasio has shown a strong preference for having the annual Times Square ball drop go on as planned — the last major event of his eight-year tenure, which ends Jan. 1.Little more than a month ago, de Blasio gleefully announced that a fully vaccinated crowd of hundreds of thousands of people would be back at the iconic celebration — donning goofy 2022-themed glasses and watching a crystal-clad ball drop at midnight — after it was limited last year to small groups of essential workers.But that was before omicron caught fire, forcing city officials and event organizers to rethink just how many people they wanted to squeeze into the bright, billboard-lined tourist haven known to some as the Crossroads of the World.On Tuesday, the Fox network gave its verdict, pulling the plug on a planned live broadcast from the New Year's Eve event. Other networks plan to air the festivities, including Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve on ABC, the stalwart now hosted by Ryan Seacrest.De Blasio said along with Thursday's announcement that the city is monitoring the COVID-19 situation and could impose additional precautions if needed. Among the other changes announced Thursday, revelers won't be allowed into viewing areas until 3 p.m., much later than in past years.On New Year's Eve last year, Times Square was mostly empty, with Jennifer Lopez and other artists performing behind police barricades. After vaccines became widely available in the U.S., the city allowed crowds back to the Macy's Fourth of July fireworks, the Macy's Thanksgiving Parade and other events."New York is the best place in the world to celebrate New Year's Eve and now it will be one of the safest against COVID as well," Mayor-elect Eric Adams said in a written statement endorsing the new precautions. "New Yorkers and visitors alike can now enjoy Times Square and the rest of our city as we ring in 2022."Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Scott HensleyJoe HernandezMerck says it will have 10 million packs of its new COVID-19 treatment available by the end of the month.Merck & Co., Inc.hide captionMerck says it will have 10 million packs of its new COVID-19 treatment available by the end of the month.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration hasauthorized the second antiviral pillto treat COVID-19 at home.The medicine, called molnupiravir and made by Merck and Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, is taken twice a day for five days. Merck says it will have 10 million packs available by the end of the month.Thesenew antiviral pills could totally changehow people treat COVID-19 infections at home, since the only FDA-authorized treatment for nonhospitalized COVID-19 patients is monoclonal antibodies, which typically require an intravenous infusion.The agency authorizedPfizer's Paxlovid treatment for COVID-19on Wednesday."Today's authorization provides an additional treatment option against the COVID-19 virus in the form of a pill that can be taken orally," Dr. Patrizia Cavazzoni, director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said Thursday."Molnupiravir is limited to situations where other FDA-authorized treatments for COVID-19 are inaccessible or are not clinically appropriate and will be a useful treatment option for some patients with COVID-19 at high risk of hospitalization or death," she added.The drug works by introducing mutations into the SARS-CoV-2 virus's genetic code to prevent it from replicating.FDA didn't authorize molnupiravir for use in patients younger than 18 because the drug may interfere with bone and cartilage growth.The agency also said the medicine is not recommended for use during pregnancy because animal studies suggested it could harm the fetus. The FDA warned people who may become pregnant to use a reliable method of birth control while taking molnupiravir until four days after the final dose. Men who are sexually active with women who may become pregnant are advised to use birth control while taking molnupiravir and for at least three months after the final dose.The pill is available by prescription only, andtreatment should begin as soon as possible after a COVID-19 diagnosis and within five days of the onset of symptoms in order to treat mild-to-moderate disease, the FDA said.A version of this story originally appearedin theMorning Edition live blog.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Maria GodoyA firefighter tests the seal on his N95 mask at the start of his shift in Glen Burnie, Md. With the spread of omicron, experts say to wear high-filtration respirators in public indoor spaces for the best protection.Alex Edelman/AFP via Getty Imageshide captionA firefighter tests the seal on his N95 mask at the start of his shift in Glen Burnie, Md. With the spread of omicron, experts say to wear high-filtration respirators in public indoor spaces for the best protection.With another coronavirus variant racing across the U.S., once again health authorities are urging people to mask up indoors. Yes, you've heard it all before. But given how contagious omicron is, experts say, it's seriously time to upgrade to an N95 or similar high-filtration respirator when you're in public indoor spaces."Cloth masks are not going to cut it with omicron," saysLinsey Marr, a researcher at Virginia Tech who studies how viruses transmit in the air.Omicron is so much more transmissible than coronavirus variants that have come before it. It spreads at least three times faster than delta. One person is infecting at least three others at a time on average, based on data from other countries."It's very contagious," says Dr.Robert Wachter, chair of the Department of Medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. "And the kind of encounter that you could have had with prior versions of the virus that would have left you uninfected, there's now a good chance you will get infected from it."True, a cloth mask can be a "marginally OK to maybe a decent filter," Marr says. But with something as highly transmissible as omicron, just "OK" isn't good enough.Marr notes that preliminary data from scientists at the University of Hong Kong has shown that omicronmultiplies 70 times fasterinside human respiratory tract tissue than the delta variant does. That study also found that omicron reaches higher levels in respiratory tract tissue 48 hours after infection, compared with delta."That would suggest to me that maybe it reaches higher levels and then we spew out more [virus particles] if we're infected," Marr says. And while it's too soon to tell, she says it's conceivable that omicron is so good at infecting us, we just need to breathe in fewer viral particles of omicron to get infected.And virus particles from an infectious person can linger in the air indoors for minutes or even hours after they leave a room in some situations, saysDr. Abraar Karan, an infectious disease physician at Stanford University. "I think that people need to realize that transmission here can happen even when you're not near somebody," he says.Given all this, you want a mask that means business when it comes to blocking viral particles. Unlike cloth masks, N95, KN95 andKF94respirators are all made out of material with an electrostatic charge, which "actually pulls these particles in as they're floating around and prevents you from inhaling those particles," Karan notes. "And that really is key" — because if you don't inhale virus particles, they can't multiply in your respiratory tract.The material in surgical masks also has an electrostatic charge. But surgical masks tend to fit loosely, and a snug fit — with no gaps around nose, cheeks or chin — "really makes a big difference," says Marr, who has studied mask efficacy.KN95s tend to be a bit more comfortable than N95s, but counterfeits continue to be a problem. For safer shopping, check out a site likeProject N95, a nonprofit that helps consumers find legitimate personal protective equipment. Or check the CDC's site for advice onhow to spot a counterfeitand a list ofNIOSH-approved N95s.(For health care workers who need surgical N95s, here's theCDC's list of trusted sources.)For maximum protection, make sure your N95 fits snugly as well, creating a seal around your mouth and nose. The CDC explainswhat makes a good fitand how to test thatyours is sealing well.Still, surgical masks are cheaper than respirators. And if cost is a factor for you, at a minimum consider topping a surgical mask with a cloth mask to ensure a tighter fit, or get a mask fitter — a frame that fits over your surgical mask to make it more snug. While these options won't offer as much protection as an N95, they're a big improvement over a cloth mask alone, Karan and Marr say.As to when to wear a mask, obviously you want to cover up when you're using public transit, including airports and airplanes, and when you're indoors in grocery stores or other public places, as with previous surges. Check to see whether where you live has a lot of cases —most places do right now.Wachter says he's also covering up indoors with small groups of friends and family unless everyone is vaccinated and boosted. If they're not boosted, he says, "I consider them to be somewhere between vaccinated and unvaccinated, and I act appropriately if I'm going to be around them." That means he either has everyone mask up, or he has everyone take a rapid test to make sure no one is infectious at that moment. "One or the other." This is especially important if anyone attending is high-risk.Marr says that with omicron surging, she'd have kids wear respirators if possible when they're indoors in public spaces. Parents searching for good respirator options for their children can check out the work ofAaron Collins, aka "Mask Nerd," a mechanical engineer with a background in aerosol science. He's been testing the filtration efficiencies of hundreds of masks and respirators on the market. You can find his reviews on hisYouTube channel. (This spreadsheeton kids' masks may also be helpful.)Combined with getting vaccinated and boosted, upgrading to a high-filtration mask will be key to enjoying a safer holiday season without having to hibernate, experts say."I have a lot of confidence in the vaccines, if you're boosted, in protecting against severe outcomes," Marr says, "and I have a lot of confidence in an N95 and similar types of respirators. And I think that with those two things, you can still go about a lot of your normal activities."Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

Harris tested negative via a PCR test for the virus on Wednesday and will be tested again in the coming days."The Vice President is tested on a regular basis. As a part of that regular testing, the Vice President received an antigen test this morning and tested negative," the White House said in a statement."Earlier today, after being notified of the staffer's positive test, the Vice President received a PCR test and tested negative. She will be tested again on Friday then again on Monday per CDC guidance."Harris will continue with her daily schedule and will depart for her home state of California later Wednesday, remaining there through the New Year.Harris' staffer is thesecond close White House contactto test positive for the virus this week. On Monday, the White House said that a staffer who had recently traveled aboard Air Force One with President Biden had also tested positive for COVID-19.Bidentested negativefor the virus most recently on Wednesday.Both the president and vice president are fully vaccinated against the virus and have been boosted as well.The White House coronavirus cases come as the United States is entering another virus swell, fueled by the delta and omicron variants.The coronavirus pandemic, which in March will mark its second full year in the United States, has put a damper on many Americans' holiday plans.While more than204 million peoplein the United States are fully vaccinated against the virus, about 40% of the population is not.Speaking on Tuesday about the rising threat the omicron variant poses, particularly to the unvaccinated, Biden struck a firmer tone than he previously has, laying out a dim future for eligible Americans who still refuse to get the vaccine."We should all be concerned about omicron but not panicked. If you're fully vaccinated, and especially if you got your booster shot, you are highly protected. And if you're unvaccinated, you're at higher risk of getting severely ill from COVID-19, getting hospitalized, and even dying," he said."Look, the unvaccinated are responsible for their own choices. But those choices have been fueled by dangerous misinformation on cable TV and social media," he said, referencing thedisinformation campaign against vaccinesthat has taken hold in rightwing media spaces."You know, these companies and personalities are making money by peddling lies and allowing misinformation that can kill their own customers and their own supporters."A DecemberNPR analysisshows that people living in counties that voted heavily for former President Donald Trump in 2020 have been nearly three times as likely to die from COVID-19 as those who live in areas that supported Biden.Trump, under whom the vaccine was developed, was slow to respond to the coronavirus crisis and ultimately leaned into falsehoods about the virus, its spread and the officials in charge of helping to contain the pandemic.Trump announced this week he had received his booster shot against the virus.

The reward at the front of the line: free rapid tests. Carol Mehigan and her niece, Chantelle, skipped the line and showed up on foot. Mehigan was beaming."Oh my god, this is fantastic," she said to the volunteer who handed her the tests.Lowell is a virus hotspot in a state that has spiking COVID numbers. Mehigan and her extended family have been playing it safe. Despite having four families under one roof, they rarely visit one another's apartments. Nobody wants to risk giving COVID-19 to Chantelle's newborn or Mehigan's elderly mother.But for Christmas they're getting together. They've decided on a scaled-back gathering of 15 people. And Mehigan has a plan for exactly when she'll be using her free rapid test."I'm using it by the end of the week – before Christmas day," she said.With the holidays approaching and the omicron variant spreading quickly, there is growing demand for rapid tests and supply has not kept pace. On Tuesday,President Biden announcedthat the federal government will help, giving out a half-billion free rapid coronavirus tests starting in January. Several cities and states are already offering COVID tests free to their residents, handing them out at libraries and mailing them to people's houses. But, experts say, more is needed.Mehigan's rapid test is one of 2 million free test kits being distributed in Massachusetts to the 102 cities and towns with the highest percentage of families below the poverty line."The goal here is to help those families who face the greatest financial hardship and might have difficulty attaining rapid tests at a pharmacy," said Governor Charlie Baker at a press conference on Dec. 13 announcing the program.Massachusetts is joining a growing number of other states – including New Hampshire, New Jersey, Washington, Iowa, Maryland, Ohio and Colorado – with programs that offer free COVID testing to some or all of their residents. Several cities – including Boston, Philadelphia and New York – are joining in too.Some states, such as Colorado, have been distributing free rapid tests for months. And these programs have been popular. In New Hampshire, their supply of 800,000 test kits weresnapped upin a day.States are stepping up to fill a gap left by the federal government, said Lindsey Dawson, an associate director at the Kaiser Family Foundation who tracksCOVID testing availability."The federal government has really invested in vaccines and making vaccines freely and widely available for people and [it] hasn't really done that with tests," Dawson said. "We are starting to see some movement now with the new announcement [from the White House of 500 million free rapid tests], so it will be important to watch to see if that momentum continues."Dawson said a pair of rapid tests costs anywhere from $14 to $30 and that access to them – even for those able to pay – has been inconsistent. Just a few weeks ago things looked good, but "the supply has really dwindled even today compared to what I saw yesterday."White House chief medical advisor, Anthony Fauci, said there's "extraordinary demand" for testing. He said that's a good thing and that the administration is working to improve access.One reason supply isn't keeping up with demand is test manufacturers are being cautious, said Atul Grover, executive director of the Association of American Medical Colleges' Research and Action Institute."If you go back to H1N1 [flu in 2009], these companies did produce the test. The challenge was they didn't get sold. And so I think companies are very reluctant to go ahead and scale up production," Grover said. "Unless they have a guarantee that someone's going to buy them."Grover called Biden's announcement of 500 million rapid tests "a step in the right direction." But, he said, more details are needed and more tests are needed, pointing out that 500 million tests translates into less than two tests for every American."Five hundred million would be enough if we were talking about a supply for a week. And [if] we were told, 'The next 500 million are going to come every week starting in February.' Great, I'd be less worried," said Grover.Boosting the supply of rapid tests isn't just about preventing the virus's spread. It is also necessary for treatment, Grover said.New oral COVID medicationsneed to be taken within a few days of symptoms starting – and that requires being able to find a COVID test.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Rachel TreismanPeople line up to get tested for COVID-19 at East Boston Neighborhood Health Center in Boston, Mass., on Monday.Joseph Prezioso/AFP via Getty Imageshide captionPeople line up to get tested for COVID-19 at East Boston Neighborhood Health Center in Boston, Mass., on Monday.Residents of Chicago and Boston will soon be required to show proof of full vaccination in order to enter indoor spaces like gyms, restaurants and entertainment venues, in the latest example of cities tightening public health rules to combat the spread of the omicron variant.The Chicago Department of Public HealthannouncedTuesdaythat beginning Jan. 3, the city will require everyone ages 5 and up to be fully vaccinated in order to access indoor dining, fitness and recreation venues. They must present either their vaccination card, a photocopy of it, a digital record or a printed record from their vaccine provider."To put it simply, if you have been living vaccine-free, your time is up," Mayor Lori Lightfootwrote on Twitter. "If you wish to live life as w/the ease to do the things you love, you must be vax'd. This health order may pose an inconvenience to the unvaccinated, and in fact it is inconvenient by design."The order will remain in effect until city officials have determined the threat of COVID-19 to public health has "diminished significantly," she added.It comes as Chicago is seeing its highest number of hospitalizations since last winter's surge and its highest rate of deaths in months, Lightfoot said, adding that a post-holiday surge in cases is expected.The city is averaging nearly 1,800 cases per day, up 79% from just a week ago, according tomember station WBEZ. Dr. Allison Arwady, the city's top public health official, predicted it will break its single-day new case record in the next week or so."We didn't want it to get to this point, but given the situation we find ourselves in, we have no choice," Lightfoot tweeted.As forthe fine print: The order defines "fully vaccinated" as two weeks after either one shot of a single-dose vaccine or the second shot of an mRNA vaccine series. Proof of vaccination is not required for employees of such businesses, but masks and weekly negative COVID-19 tests are. The order does not apply to places like houses of worship, grocery stores, schools and locations such as residential or office buildings and the airport.In announcing its decision, Chicago's health department said the order was driven in part by the omicron variant and is in line with existing requirements in large cities like New York and Los Angeles.Los Angeles started requiring proof of vaccination at awide range of businessesin November. New York has required proof of vaccination for indoor settingssince early August, and earlier this month announced avaccine mandate for private companiesthat is set to take effect on Monday.Chicago's announcement came one day after Boston said a similar policy would take effect in mid-January.Underthe new order, people must show proof of vaccination in order to get into indoor restaurants, bars, nightclubs, fitness centers and entertainment venues (here's the full listof settings).It will roll out to different age groups between January and May. Beginning Jan. 15, people ages 12 and up will have to show proof of one dose, which will change to proof of full vaccination one month later. Children between the ages of 5-11 must show proof of one dose starting March 1, everyone ages five and up must show proof of full vaccination beginning May 1.The order doesn't currently require booster shots, but the city says that is subject to change based on public health data and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance. It applies to patrons as well as employees of those businesses.Mayor Michelle Wusaid Boston is also tightening its vaccine requirement for city employees.City workers have until now been allowed to avoid vaccination by submitting to weekly tests, but will no longer be able to do so unless they qualify for a medical or religious exemption,member stationWGBHexplains. Citing Wu, it adds that 90 percent of Boston's nearly 18,000-strong workforce has already been vaccinated.WGBH also reports that several Massachusetts cities and townsappear to be following Boston's leadand are expected to announce indoor vaccine requirements imminently.Other cities are bringing back or tightening public health measures as omicron spreads.The mayor ofWashington, D.C., for example, reinstated its mask mandate effective Wednesday — exactly a month after she lifted it — as the city reports consecutive days of record-breaking new infections. And the city council of Oakland, Calif.,passed an ordinanceon Tuesday requiring proof of vaccination for many indoor businesses, effective Feb. 1.This story first appeared in theMorning Editionlive blog.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Tamara KeithPresident Joe Biden listens during a meeting with his task force on supply chain issues on Wednesday.Patrick Semansky/APhide captionPresident Joe Biden listens during a meeting with his task force on supply chain issues on Wednesday.President Biden has tested negative for COVID-19, the White House said.The PCR test was done after a White House staff member — who had flown with Biden on Air Force One on Friday — tested positive for COVID on Monday. The staff member, who was fully vaccinated and boosted,experienced symptoms on Sunday. Biden had tested negative on Sunday and Monday, but was tested again on Wednesday as a precaution.The results come the day after Biden talked abouthis latest plansfor the highly contagious omicron variant — and tried to reassure vaccinated people about breakthrough cases."Because omicron spreads so easily, we'll see some fully vaccinated people get COVID, potentially in large numbers," Biden said.  "There will be positive cases in every office, even here in the White House."The White House has rigorous procedures in place to try to prevent the spread of COVID on its campus, where the president lives and where hundreds of people work each day. Biden is regularly tested for the virus. People who travel with him or who are scheduled to be in meetings with him are tested beforehand.After Thanksgiving, when Biden's voice was noticeably hoarse, his physician gave him a battery of tests to determine he really had just caught a cold. Biden blamed his young grandson Beau, who brought both germs and kisses to the family's gathering in Nantucket. The White House released a memo from the president's doctor verifying that he didn't have COVID.White House Press Secretary Jen Psakihad COVID in October, making her the highest-ranking White House official to publicly reveal a case. There have been other cases at the White House as well, but the administration does not publicly discuss them.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Scott HensleyPfizer's antiviral pill Paxlovid was authorized to treat COVID-19, by the Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday.David Dee Delgado/Getty Imageshide captionPfizer's antiviral pill Paxlovid was authorized to treat COVID-19, by the Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday.A federal agency has released the first allocations of Paxlovid, the new COVID-19 treatment from Pfizer, to states and territories.  The federal government has a contract for 10 million courses of the treatment and is providing the medicine free to state and territorial health departments.The government acknowledges that supplies will be tight to start."An initial 65,000 courses of Paxlovid will be made available for shipment to states and territories and will begin arriving at dispensing sites by the end of December," anHHS website says.Only California, Florida, New York and Texas are receiving more than 3,000 treatment courses. By contrast, Washington, D.C., Alaska and North Dakota will each get only 120 for now. Federally funded health centers that serve low-income patients around the country will get enough Paxlovid for 9,750 patients.The Food and Drug Administration authorized Paxlovid for emergency use on Wednesday.The drug is an oral antiviral pill that can be taken at home to help keep high-risk patients from getting so sick that they need to be hospitalized. It's taken twice a day for five days in combination with a second medicine called ritonavir, a generic antiviral.When FDA authorized the pill, Dr. Patrizia Cavazzoni, director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, called it "a major step forward in the fight against this global pandemic.""This authorization provides a new tool to combat COVID-19 at a crucial time in the pandemic as new variants emerge and promises to make antiviral treatment more accessible to patients who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19," she said.The results from a Pfizer study involving more than 2,200 people at high risk for developing serious COVID-19 found Paxlovid reduced the risk of hospitalization or death by 89%, compared with a placebo, when taken within three days of first symptoms of illness. When taken within five days, the drug reduced the risk of hospitalization and death by 88%.Early results from another Paxlovid study showed a 70% reduction in hospitalization risk among several hundred people at lower risk for severe disease.Although it's not certain, Paxlovid's efficacy is unlikely to be reduced in treating people infected with the omicron variant of the coronavirus virus. The drug, which belongs to a family called protease inhibitors, doesn't target the virus's spike protein, as the vaccines do.The federal government has a contract with Pfizer to buy 10 million courses of the treatment for $5.3 billion. But initial supplies of Paxlovid will be limited. The company says it will have 180,000 course of treatment ready by the end of the year. It expects to have millions of doses available in 2022.The FDA also authorized another antiviral COVID-19 pill Thursday, this one from Merck and Ridgeback Biotherapeutics that is also taken twice a day for five days.There's more of this drug — molnupiravir — to go around. Merck says it will have 10 million packs available by the end of the month.But the effectiveness of the Merck COVID-19 pill may make it less attractive. An interim analysis of a clinical study of the drug found that molnupiravir cut the risk of hospitalization or death in half. However, the final study analysis released a couple of days before a public meeting of advisers to the FDA, found only a 30% reduction in the risk of hospitalization or death.But Nicholas Kartsonis, Merck's senior vice president of clinical research for infectious diseases and vaccines told NPR that among the 10 deaths in the study, nine were in people who got the placebo and only one was a patient who took the molnupiravir.FDA didn't authorize molnupiravir for use in patients younger than 18 because the drug may interfere with bone and cartilage growth and doesn't recommend it for use during pregnancy because animal studies suggested it could harm the fetus.The FDA's Cavazzoni said Thursday that molnupiravir is intended for situations "where other FDA-authorized treatments for COVID-19 are inaccessible or are not clinically appropriate."That could include certain patients who can't take Paxlovid, which can interact badly with certain medications, including some commonly given for heart disease and cancer, according to Dr. John Farley with the FDA's office of infectious diseases. It is also not recommended for patients with severe kidney problems or cirrhosis of the liver, he said.NPR's Joe Palca contributed to this report.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

Drake wrote in a letter to UC chancellors.Other colleges and universities are taking similar precautions to ensure students returning to campus don't unintentionally bring COVID-19 back with them.Stanford University willhold classes onlinefor the first two weeks of its winter quarter, and it's urging students to get boosters and receive a negative test result before returning to campus.Other institutions moving classes online to start the new year includeHarvard University, theUniversity of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, andKean University, among many others.Scientists believe thehighly transmissible omicron variantwill produce a massive spike in infections in the coming weeks but is also likely to have lower rates of severe illness and deaths.Some schools, such asNorthwestern UniversityandOberlin College, will require students to have a booster shot by early next year as long as they are eligible. Booster shots have been shown to be effective against omicron.The Biden administration previously said K-12 schools could limit quarantines bytesting unvaccinated children who were in close contactwith someone who had COVID-19 rather than making them stay home for 14 days, a practice known as "test to stay."Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Vanessa RomoNew York City Mayor-elect Eric Adams announced on Tuesday he will be postponing his planned Jan.1 inauguration ceremony.Brittainy Newman/APhide captionNew York City Mayor-elect Eric Adams announced on Tuesday he will be postponing his planned Jan.1 inauguration ceremony.Cities across the globe are in the grip of a renewed COVID-19 crisis, as the omicron variant triggers new coronavirus case spikes that many hoped were in the past.In the U.S., the alarming surge in infections is prompting city leaders and heads of companies to withdraw from public events that would inevitably draw large crowds and potentially expose more people to the virus. It has even moved the NHL to announce it will keep players from participating in the upcoming Winter Olympics in Beijing.In New York,Mayor-elect Eric Adams, who was hoping to buck tradition by holding his inauguration on Jan. 1 inside of a historical Brooklyn theater rather than on the steps of City Hall, is now postponing the event."All I need is a mattress and a floor to execute being the mayor of the City of New York,"Adams said."I don't need an inauguration," he said, adding that it would be best "if  we forgo an inauguration because we don't want to put people in a dangerous environment."The National Hockey Leagueannounced on Wednesdaythat its players will not be participating in the 2022 Beijing Olympics because of the pandemic, reflecting concerns about the rest of the season as well."The National Hockey League respects and admires the desire of NHL Players to represent their countries and participate in a 'best on best' tournament. Accordingly, we have waited as long as possible to make this decision while exploring every available option to enable our Players to participate in the 2022 Winter Olympic Games," NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman said in a statement announcing the decision. "Unfortunately, given the profound disruption to the NHL's regular-season schedule caused by recent COVID-related events ... Olympic participation is no longer feasible."An outbreak among players has already prompted postponement of a slew of games and an earlier holiday break than usual. As of Saturday, there weremore than 60 players in the COVID-19 protocol. All but one player in the league has been vaccinated.Renewed COVID-19 fears have also reached the tech world. CES, an annual trade show organized by the Consumer Technology Association that is held annually in Las Vegas, is facing rising cancellations from some of the biggest names in the industry.Meta Platforms Inc. (parent of Facebook), Twitter and Pinterest all announced separately on Tuesday that they will not be sending company representatives to the conference, despite efforts by organizers to make it safe for attendees."Due to the spike in Covid cases across the country in the past week, we've decided to cancel our in-person presence at CES next month," Twitter said in a statement. "We'll continue to actively monitor the situation into the new year and find other opportunities to connect with our clients and partners."Meta issued a similar statement, saying, "Out of an abundance of caution and care for our employees, we won't be attending CES in-person due to the evolving public health concerns related to Covid-19."Officials noted the company had already planned to scale back its participation in this year's events, adding that it is exploring exploring ways to participate virtually.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Carrie JohnsonAttorney General Merrick Garland speaks on Nov. 15, 2021, in Washington. On Tuesday, the Justice Department issued a new legal opinion that could allow thousands of people released from prison to home confinement at the start of the pandemic to remain free.Evan Vucci/APhide captionAttorney General Merrick Garland speaks on Nov. 15, 2021, in Washington. On Tuesday, the Justice Department issued a new legal opinion that could allow thousands of people released from prison to home confinement at the start of the pandemic to remain free.The Justice Departmenthas reversed course in a legal analysis, which could allow thousands of people released from prison at the start of the pandemic to remain free once the coronavirus emergency ends.In a rare reconsideration, the department's Office of Legal Counsel issued a new legal opinion concluding the Bureau of Prisons "has discretion to permit prisoners in extended home confinement to remain there."Attorney General Merrick Garland asked the OLC to reconsider the issue after personally reviewing the law. The move comes after months of intense pressure from a coalition of advocates across the political spectrum, who had urged the Department of Justice and the White House to reconsider.Attorney General Garland just called!!!! DOJ will be issuing a new OLC memo today, clarifying that people on CARES act home confinement don’t need to return to prison at the end of the pandemic. I told him thousands would be grateful for this news before the holidays."Thousands of people on home confinement have reconnected with their families, have found gainful employment, and have followed the rules," Garland said in a written statement. "We will exercise our authority so that those who have made rehabilitative progress and complied with the conditions of home confinement, and who in the interests of justice should be given an opportunity to continue transitioning back to society, are not unnecessarily returned to prison."Earlier Tuesday, Garland met with a small group of people on home confinement to learn more about their experiences and challenges, the Justice Department said.Kevin Ring, who advocates for people in prison and their families at the group FAMM,recently told NPR the issue was a "bellwether" for the Biden administration's criminal justice efforts."For somebody who isn't sure whether they can get a lease, start a family, start a relationship, begin college courses, get on with their life, it's incredibly callous to say, 'Oh, we haven't made a decision yet and we don't have to because there's a pandemic still going on,'" Ring said earlier this month.The new memo, authored by Assistant Attorney General Christopher Schroeder,  said the office did not "lightly depart from our precedents" but concluded that a prior opinion issued at the close of the Trump administration "failed to address important and persuasive counterarguments."Schroeder wrote that the best reading of the law did not require thousands of people released to home confinement earlier in the pandemic to be returned "en masse to correctional facilities when the emergency period ends." He added that the Bureau of Prisons typically makes decisions about home confinement on a case-by-case basis, avoiding what he called a "blanket, one-size-fits-all policy."The news arrived only days before the Christmas holiday, which prompted Holly Harris, president of the group Justice Action Network, to tweet, "I screamed into the phone but who cares it's A CHRISTMAS MIRACLE!!! "Udi Ofer, director of the Justice Division at the American Civil Liberties Union, commended the Justice Department for its action. But Ofer said there's still plenty of room for prison authorities to return some people to prison. And he called on the White House to help them."We also recognize that the threat of eventual return to prison is still present, so we ask President Biden to use his clemency powers to provide permanent relief to families," Ofer said in a statement. "A future administration can still force people back to prison, and families will not have permanent closure until their cases are permanently resolved."Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Anya KamenetzSophomore Dreshon Robinson stands outside his high school cafeteria, where the learning hub takes place. He wants to go to college and be an audio engineer.Cornell Watson for NPRhide captionSophomore Dreshon Robinson stands outside his high school cafeteria, where the learning hub takes place. He wants to go to college and be an audio engineer.It's 4:30 in the afternoon, and the fall colors in the trees are glowing as the sun drops low over the sprawling, historic campus of Grimsley High School in Greensboro, N.C. Dozens of students are waiting outside the cafeteria.One of them is sophomore Dreshon Robinson. He wants to be a music engineer someday. He loves Adele and Bruno Mars. But right now, he's working evenings in a restaurant. And Monday through Thursday after school, he comes to Grimsley High school's "learning hub."Here, from 4:30 to 6 p.m., there are certified teachers to help with any subject Dre needs. On Tuesdays and Thursdays, there's free dinner too – maybe Chick-fil-A or pizza – and a bus to take you home."If I do need tutoring or if I need help," Dre says, "it's teachers in there, so I can get help with my schoolwork. So I don't ever get behind. Because I'm not one for catching up."Like districts all over the country, Guilford County, a large system of more than 70,000 students in the north-central part of the state, is playing catchup.They have seen falling test scores after months of remote and hybrid learning and all of the stresses and traumas of the pandemic. Many high school students started working last year when their parents lost jobs. Some are working two jobs.Dreshon typically works from 6:30 to 10 p.m., five days a week. When he's home, he crashes, exhausted, or dedicates time to friends or family. "I'm not ever doing school work at home."Dreshon Robinson says Sierra Hanapole is his favorite teacher. "She just has a good character. She's really cool. You know, she's not one of those teachers that freak out."Cornell Watson for NPRhide captionDreshon Robinson says Sierra Hanapole is his favorite teacher. "She just has a good character. She's really cool. You know, she's not one of those teachers that freak out."Guilford County first opened a version of these learning hubs last school year during remote learning. They were there to give students access to computers and broadband internet, which 1 in 5 families lacked at the start of the pandemic.The Walton Family Foundation and the Michael & Susan Dell Foundation (Dell Technologies is a financial supporter of NPR) funded the hubs this fall to help students  stay engaged in school. The grants cover payment for teachers, transportation, meals and incentives for students who stick with their commitment to attend, like gift cards to buy gas.The hubs opened across the district in October. Some schools have Saturday sessions as well as after school. So far about 2,450 students have shown up at least once, a number the district is hoping will grow.At Grimsley High School, word has spread, and the hub has had to move from the media center to the larger cafeteria.Teachers identify students who are behind and recommend them for the hub. "We have got a lot of kids who typically would have tapped out at this particular point in the year," says Grimsley's assistant principal, Christopher Burnette, who oversees the hub.I don't want to ever fall behind again because it is really hard.Dreshon Robinson, SophomoreWhen students get their report cards and see low grades in the first quarter, Burnette explained, "they realize that this is a no-win situation. And then they start to fade back." Attendance drops. They're turning less work in. Grades plummet.That could have been Dreshon Robinson. He lost 15 days this fall to COVID quarantines."Biology is hard to teach from a computer," says Dreshon's favorite teacher, Sierra Hannipole. "When he got behind, there was a struggle to pick him back up. And that's unfair to him because he does try. "Sierra Hannipole says her science students who attend the learning hub at Grimsley High School have seen their grades bump up.Cornell Watson for NPRhide captionSierra Hannipole says her science students who attend the learning hub at Grimsley High School have seen their grades bump up."I don't want to ever fall behind again because it is really hard," Dreshon agrees."Like, you come in, and everybody's like, 'Oh, Dre's back!' Then you be like, 'Oh, what are we doing?' 'We doing this.' I'm like, 'Oh. I don't know what that is.'"Since Dreshon started attending the hub, Hannipole says, he's not only caught up, but he's more on top of his deadlines, more proactive. "What I've noticed different from him is a stronger level of accountability."The cafeteria is a newer building with high ceilings and walls of windows. Inside, the mood is calm and friendly. Students are sitting with their friends, but they're staying on task. Some high achievers on the school's International Baccalaureate track have been showing up voluntarily to not only do their own homework, but help their friends.All over the country, schools are reportingrecord levels of staff burnout. The hub model relies on teachers volunteering to extend their work day, not to mention counselors, the custodians and the bus drivers.On the evening we visit, Burnette's children join him for the school-provided dinner. His wife is an assistant principal at another school, so they trade evening duties.Sierra Hannipole helps Dreshon Robinson with biology during the learning hub. The hub is open to all students Monday through Thursday after school. Students can get help with schoolwork or see a counselor. There's also free food.Cornell Watson for NPRhide captionSierra Hannipole helps Dreshon Robinson with biology during the learning hub.

There's also free food."We have to make sure that we practice what we preach," he says. When he asks teachers to volunteer, he reminds them it will be helpful for the students. "I just ask, if you can give your kids an hour, it will be more beneficial to them."Tajae Pryce, who teaches special education at Grimsley, is consistently at the hub.Our kids have been through trauma that we can't imagine.Tajae Pryce, Teacher"Students have always benefited from one-on-one and small groups," he says. "Being able to have that time built in to do that has been really great."For Pryce, the big payoff is better relationships with his students. "I've met kids who have never spoken in class before, who hadn't had that confidence before or made a connection ... because of lack of time," he explains. "So I really feel like Grimsley High School is like a model of what we could be doing. It's been pretty successful."Counselors and social workers also come to the hub, for students who need someone to talk to."Our kids have been through trauma that we can't imagine. Not even counting the disease, but just the economic effects," Pryce says. "I have kids whose parents have lost jobs, kids who are working, helping with rent and bills. These kids are impacted by crime and other things in our community. So this is a good place for them to be."In the spring of 2021, with the help of Saturday learning hubs, increased flexibility from the state, and a summer quarter, Guilford County posted the highest high school graduation rate in its history: 91.4 percent. That's in a district where nearly two-thirds of students are living in poverty.This school year, when they came back in person, Sharon Contreras, the superintendent, says they did not want to leave any student behind.The pandemic has forced schools to come up with new solutions. Sierra Hannipole teaches biology and astronomy at Grimsley High school in Greensboro, North Carolina.Cornell Watson for NPRhide captionThe pandemic has forced schools to come up with new solutions. Sierra Hannipole teaches biology and astronomy at Grimsley High school in Greensboro, North Carolina."We did home visits. Everyone from myself to principals to school resource officers knocked on doors. We visited shelters," she said. "We were very concerned that we could not place our eyes on students, we did not know if they were OK. We already knew that academically they were suffering. But there are many more concerns that go beyond academic concerns. ... So we just knocked on doors saying, 'Please come back, it's safe to come back to school.'"Contreras has a grand vision for the future of these hubs. She would like to offer more flexible scheduling for students, especially those who must work to support their families. They could attend hubs before, and after, regular school hours to get their main course credits for graduation.And she'd even like to pay students directly for attending the hub. "I think it's part of the silver lining of the pandemic that we thought about some of the old practices that just weren't beneficial for students. "For his part, Dreshon Robinson says the learning hub is giving him new skills to handle his schoolwork."I was like, studying is whack," he says. "But then you get to high school, you're like, 'Dang. maybe I do need to study,' but I'm like, 'I don't know how to study.' So you go to the learning hub, they help you."He's happy to be back at school in person. He says he wants to go to college and pursue his dreams.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

President Biden has tested negative for the virus.The White House said that a staff member who traveled on Air Force One on Friday tested positive for COVID on Monday – but said that President Biden has been tested twice so far since having contact with the person, and has tested negative. Biden will be tested again on Wednesday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in a statement.Psaki said the "mid-level staff member," who was not named, had spent about 30 minutes "in proximity" to Biden on Air Force One between Orange, S.C. and Philadelphia. The staff member is fully vaccinated and boosted, and tested negative before boarding the plane, Psaki said. "This staff member did not begin to experience symptoms until Sunday, and was tested on Monday," Psaki said."As CDC guidance does not require fully vaccinated people to quarantine after an exposure, the president will continue with his daily schedule," Psaki said.Biden is tested regularly for COVID, and received an antigen test on Sunday.

Jonathan FranklinPeople wait at a street-side testing booth in New York's Times Square on Monday.Ed Jones/AFP via Getty Imageshide captionPeople wait at a street-side testing booth in New York's Times Square on Monday.The omicron variant is now considered the most dominant version of the coronavirus — making up 73% of new COVID-19 infections last week in the U.S., according tonew datareleased by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Monday.The new estimates capture cases for the week that ended on Dec. 18.The new estimates underscore just how rapidly it has spread across the U.S. As of a week prior, Dec. 11, it was detected in only 12.6% of positive COVID-19 cases that were sampled.The CDC said it was working on revising some of the earlier numbers after officials finish analyzing more samples of the strain.Omicron is even more prevalent in some parts of the U.S., including the Pacific Northwest, the Great Lakes, the Southeast, a cluster of states centered on Texas, and New England, where it is above 90% of samples.Since the end of June, the delta variant of COVID-19 had been the primary strain of the virus causing the majority of U.S. infections, with more than 99% of new coronavirus cases being delta in the past several months.Much about the omicron variant, scientists say, still remains uncertain — including whether the new variant causes more- or less-severe illness."All of us have a date with omicron," Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, told The Associated Press. "If you're going to interact with society, if you're going to have any type of life, omicron will be something you encounter, and the best way you can encounter this is to be fully vaccinated."Omicron has already triggered a wave of new infections across the U.S. and the world, with health officials warning of its extraordinary transmissibility.Early datasuggests that while omicron can more easily evade immune protection and booster shots than prior strains, those infected may be less likely to experience severe disease and hospitalization.However, "even if it has a somewhat lower risk of severity, we could be having a million cases a day if we're not really attentive to all of those mitigation strategies," outgoing National Institutes of Health DirectorFrancis Collins told NPR over the weekend.Getting booster shots appears to still offer substantial protection against severe disease and death from omicron,according to health officials.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

Stocks around the world tumbled over fears of the omicron variant.Spencer Platt/Getty Imageshide captionA trader works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange at the start of trading on Monday. Stocks around the world tumbled over fears of the omicron variant.Wall Street tumbled on Monday over fears about the omicron variant, which is spreading around the world in the midst of the busy holiday season.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 1.2%, or 433 points. The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 also fell by more than 1% each. Other exchanges around the world tumbled as well on Monday.Investors worry about the impact from omicron at a time when the global economy is still recovering from the impact of the pandemic.Omicron is now the dominant strain of the coronavirus in the U.S., accounting for the bulk of new infections.Here are three things to know about how omicron could hit stocks.Though most people are not yet sounding the alarm bells, worries are certainly increasing.More immediately, investors fear the impact from new restrictions being imposed around the world, which havethe potential to shut down global travel and exacerbate the supply chain constraints around the world.Over the weekend, the Netherlands imposed a lockdown, and other countries are imposing or considering restrictions on social gatherings and on travel.The World Economic Forum announced plans to postpone its annual gathering of heads of state and high-profile executives in Davos, Switzerland. Over the weekend, organizers cancelled concerts and sporting events.These restrictions could potentially hit spending around the world especially during this holiday period when more people were planning to gather and travel after vaccines had been widely rolled out.Another big fear is how it impacts the global supply chain. Previous outbreaks of COVID-19 have shut factories in China and the Philippines among other countries and made the transport of goods even more difficult.In an aerial view, shipping containers sit on truck transport chassis in a rail yard in Los Angeles on Oct. 22.

Investors worry about the potential impact from omicron on already strained global supply chains.Investors acknowledge there is a lot they don't know. Scientists first identified the variant only a few weeks ago."The biggest concern that markets have is that no one seems to have an edge on the path forward," says Eric Freedman, the chief investment officer in the asset management group at U.S. Bank.Of course, Wall Street has seen other COVID-19 variants such as Delta emerge. In the past, when that has happened, it rattled markets, but downturns tended to be short-lived.So markets have proven to be remarkably resilient, and even after Monday's selloff, the major U.S. indexes are still close to record levels.Of course, much will depend on the progress of omicron, and how businesses and governments react.Omicron is also spreading in what is traditionally a quiet period in Wall Street. That means fewer people are trading, which tends to magnify any moves.Chances are investors will remain cautious as the end of the year approaches.A 'Now Hiring' sign hangs in front of a Winn-Dixie grocery store in Miami on Dec. 3.

Omicron is spreading at a time when some businesses such as restaurants are already strugging to find workers.The bottom line is this new variant has added another layer of uncertainty to a market that already has been dealing with uncertainty about the year ahead.Inflation continues to be a huge concern. As the global economy hasreopened, prices have climbed higher than many policymakers expected.Many of the world's largest central banks, including the Federal Reserve, have begun to scale back some of the programs and policies they put in place during the pandemic, to prop up markets and the economy.The Fed, which has kept interest rates near zero for a long time, has signaled it could raise them three times in 2022. Higher interest rates mean higher borrowing costs for companies and consumers, and investors continue to game out what that could mean.Because the Fed and other central bank did so much during the first part of the pandemic, Savita Subramanian, the head of U.S. equity and derivatives strategy at Bank of America, wonders how they would respond if omicron leads to another downturn."The question is how much money can we throw at the problem at this point?" she says.There are other uncertainties. There is still considerable debate about the U.S. jobs market. Many businesses such as restaurants continue to struggle to find workers, and those challenges could make that harder if people fear they could get sick.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

There were 6,091 guests and crew members on board at the time."Each person quickly went into quarantine. Everyone who tested positive was asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic, and we continuously monitored their health," according to a statement from Royal Caribbean International.TheMiami Heraldreportsthat at least one passenger had more significant symptoms. According to the newspaper, James Johnson of Orlando attested that his aunt "started feeling very ill with a sore throat and an ear ache and later developed a strong cough. After testing positive for COVID-19, Johnson said she only received an oxygen and temperature check and were told that medical staff was too overwhelmed to monitor her more closely."Asked about that report, Royal Caribbean spokesperson Lyan Sierra-Caro told NPR in an email, "all were asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic. We did not have any critical cases on board."Royal Caribbean says that six passengers left the cruise early and were transported home.Miami marked the end of a seven-night cruise that began Dec. 11 with stops in St. Maarten, St. Thomas and a private island in the Caribbean that is owned by Royal Caribbean.For cruises leaving from U.S. ports, Royal Caribbeanrequiresall passengers ages 12 and older to be vaccinated with two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine, or one dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. Passengers ages 2 and up must also showa negative testtaken within two or three days of boarding.The positive cases on the ship were identified after contact tracing a passenger who tested positive."The cruise sailed with 95% of the onboard community fully vaccinated, and 98% of those who tested positive were fully vaccinated," according to Royal Caribbean.The Centers for Disease Control and Preventionssaysit has investigated the Symphony of the Sea and the ship remains under observation.After disembarking the passengers from the Dec. 11 cruise, the ship kept on its schedule.

The Netherlands has imposed a nationwide lockdown.Peter Dejong/APhide captionA handful of people traverse down a normally bustling shopping street in the center of Amsterdam on Monday. Nations across Europe have reimposed tougher measures to stem a new wave of coronavirus infections spurred by the highly transmissible omicron variant. The Netherlands has imposed a nationwide lockdown.Whilehealth expertspromise that we're not living in March 2020 all over again — we have vaccines and other tools now — abrupt new restrictions in some countries are reminiscent of that era.The Netherlands went into lockdown on Sunday, lasting through Jan. 14, 2022. Thenew rulesurge "everyone [to] stay at home as much as possible," set limits on the number of visitors a household can receive and limit groups outdoors to two people.The country's outbreak management team concluded that omicron would be the dominant variant in the Netherlands by the end of December — sooner than predicted. With an anticipated rise in hospitalizations, the health care system is expected to become overburdened in January, necessitating the lockdown, the government explained."The spread of the Omicron variant must be slowed as soon as possible in order to ensure healthcare services remain available to all," the Dutch government said.City streets in the Netherlands were largely deserted as the lockdown came into effect, Reutersreports, though police in Rotterdam used a water cannon to disperse a thousand soccer fans who had gathered for a match between Feyenoord and Ajax. (Bottles and fireworks had also been thrown at police and the Ajax team bus, according to local news reports.)No spectatorshave been permitted at Dutch soccer matchessinceNovember.Sweden announced new travel rules starting Dec. 21 for its Nordic neighbors, requiring a vaccine certificate for travelers arriving from Norway, Denmark, Finland and Iceland,accordingto The Local in Sweden. Travelers from those countries had previously been exempt from those entry rules, which were already in force for travelers from all other counties.In Israel, Cabinet ministers added the United States and Canada to its list of "red countries," as well as adding Italy, Belgium, Germany, Hungary, Morocco, Portugal, Switzerland and Turkey. A red status — which now applies to58 countries—meansthat Israeli citizens and permanent residents are banned from travel to those countries unless they get a special exemption and that all travelers from those countries, regardless of vaccination status, must complete a period of isolation.London Mayor Sadiq Khanannouncedon Saturday a "major incident," a status thatmeansspecial coordination of government services and that hospital and emergency services may be strained. The virus is surging in Britain's capital city, with 21,594 new casesreportedthere on Sunday."We face a tsunami of infections in the coming days and weeks," U.K. Health Secretary Sajid Javidwroteover the weekend inThe Telegraph. "Omicron spreads at a pace we have never seen before and has been doubling about every two to three days. Yesterday saw more than 90,000 new cases reported across the UK. We are extremely confident the number of infections – people with the disease but who have not been confirmed by a test – is significantly higher than that."People queue outside the newly set up vaccination center at London's Wembley Stadium to receive a COVID-19 vaccine or booster on Sunday, as the booster rollout accelerates in England and case numbers spike.Tolga Akmen/AFP via Getty Imageshide captionPeople queue outside the newly set up vaccination center at London's Wembley Stadium to receive a COVID-19 vaccine or booster on Sunday, as the booster rollout accelerates in England and case numbers spike.The outbreak is spurringrecord levelsof vaccinations in the United Kingdom.France imposed tighter restrictions for travel between the U.K. and France,requiring"compelling reasons" for such travel — and tourism and business don't qualify. Vaccinated people must also present a negative test result from within the previous 24 hours, aligning with the existing rule for unvaccinated travelers.Japan closed its borders to all nonresident foreigners at theend of November.In Germany, the government is considering new restrictions on social gatherings to begin Dec. 28, The Local in Germanyreports. The rules could include limiting gatherings to no more than 10 people, not including children, as well as the closure of indoor clubs and discos.Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization, urged people to consider canceling holiday plans amid the omicron surge."An event canceled is better than a life canceled. It's better to cancel now and celebrate later, than to celebrate now and grieve later," he said Monday.New rules in Switzerland dictate that only those who have been vaccinated or recovered from COVID-19 may go inside "restaurants, cultural, sporting and leisure venues and attend indoor events,"accordingto Switzerland's national broadcaster.The omicron surge is also behind a major postponement in the country: the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos. The 2022 event had been slated to take place Jan. 17 to 21."Current pandemic conditions make it extremely difficult to deliver a global in-person meeting," the organization said in astatement. "Despite the meeting's stringent health protocols, the transmissibility of Omicron and its impact on travel and mobility have made deferral necessary."The organization says it will reschedule the event for the summer of 2022. The 2021 event was also canceled.NPR reporter Jaclyn Diaz contributed to this report.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Anthony KuhnCommuters wear masks to help curb the spread of the coronavirus during rush hour at the Shinagawa train station in Tokyo on Oct. 1. Case numbers have dropped significantly in Japan since summer. Researchers are trying to determine why. One theory is that the willingness to wear masks has made a difference; other theories are being investigated.Eugene Hoshiko/APhide captionCommuters wear masks to help curb the spread of the coronavirus during rush hour at the Shinagawa train station in Tokyo on Oct. 1. Case numbers have dropped significantly in Japan since summer. Researchers are trying to determine why. One theory is that the willingness to wear masks has made a difference; other theories are being investigated.In mid-August, not long after the Tokyo Olympics had wrapped up, the situation in Japan looked grim to Dr. Hideaki Oka, an infectious disease expert at the Saitama Medical University Hospital outside Tokyo.As he treated COVID-19 patients at his hospital, Japan was in the grip of a fifth wave of infections. New cases nationwide had surged to around 25,000 a day, and the country's medical system was being stretched to its limits.By late September, cases had plunged, and Oka is now getting a respite, of sorts."We have had zero COVID patients in our hospital for two months straight," he explains, "so we've been able to concentrate on general medicine just as in pre-COVID times."The turnaround has been so dramatic it has left experts and observers struggling to explain it. Cases dropped by more than 99% from their peak. Japan has seen less than one death a day in recent weeks, its lowest level since July 2020.After the previous four waves of infections, almost as soon as local governments lifted their states of emergency, cases quickly began to rebound. But after the most recent state of emergency was lifted, on Sept. 28, there was no sudden rebound — or at least not yet."We've had below 50 new cases [daily] on average for eight weeks," Dr. Norio Ohmagari, of Japan's National Center for Global Health and Medicine, told a meeting on Dec. 9. about the situation in Tokyo.His explanation: "We think it is due to countermeasures taken by many citizens and institutions, and accelerated vaccination, thanks to medical staffs' efforts and citizens' understanding."Oka says that the Olympics provided the political motivation for the administration of then-Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga to speed up its vaccine rollout ahead of the Games.Japan had lagged behind other developed nations earlier this year, but now nearly 80% of its population of 125 million people is fully vaccinated. It juststartedadministering booster shots this month.The vaccine is one barrier keeping the virus at bay. Oka says that it's a social norm in Japan to keep another kind of barrier over people's mouths and noses."Even though I keep having no COVID patients, I haven't seen anybody on the street in Japan not wearing masks," observers Oka. "Even though they think it may not be necessary, there is pressure for people to do the same as everyone else."Then again, Japan's neighbor South Korea has fully vaccinated more than 90% of its adult population. And masking up in public is the norm in that country too.But South Korea is going through its worst wave of infections of the pandemic so far. After a month and a half of gradual easing of restrictions, it had to reimposelimitson gatherings and business, starting on Dec. 3, with additional restrictions added on Dec. 16As was thecasein the early months of the pandemic last year, Japan is trying to figure out why its COVID-19 case numbers and fatalities remain low by international standards.Few in Japan credit the government's response to the coronavirus. Despite accelerating the vaccine rollout, Suga was generally seen as being indecisive and too concerned about the economic impact of social distancing. Hequitin September after less than a year in office.And as was the case last year, media and scientific journals continue to publish hypotheses about an "x-factor," some characteristic of Japan's people or its environment that has helped it escape more serious COVID-19 damage."One hypothesis is that there is something intrinsically different about the immune cells that the Japanese people might carry that is able to fight off the infection," says Akiko Iwasaki, an immunologist at Yale University who, in apaperlast year, tackled the question of "Why does Japan have so few cases of COVID-19?"In it, she mentions another hypothesis that says that a milder variant of the coronavirus was already circulating in Japan, giving some people immunity to SARS-CoV-2.Yet anothertheory, she adds, holds that the delta variant in Japan has mutated so that it has lost the ability to replicate, pushing itself toward extinction.Interesting as these hypotheses may be, Iwasaki says, "currently these are not proven theories.""Even if the theories are right," agrees Oka, "it is not possible for Japan to keep the country closed and blocked off to outsiders. This will not last forever. The reality is another wave will definitely come."To keep out the omicron variant, Japanclosedits borders to nonresident foreigners last month, after briefly easing such restrictions, and case numbers appear to becreepingback up.Another wave of infections, Oka adds, could quickly lay to rest any speculation that Japan is somehow exceptional when it comes to COVID-19.Chie Kobayashi contributed to this report in Tokyo.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

The NBApostponed five gamesbecause of the number of players and staff who had entered the league's COVID-19 protocols. NFLgame delayswere also piling up.The NHL and the National Hockey League Players' Association announced Sunday that the regular season would continue, but cross-border games between the U.S. and Canada would be rescheduled.Just one day earlier, the NHL said it wasstepping up coronavirus safety measuresin the face of omicron through at least Jan. 7, including increased testing requirements for both vaccinated and unvaccinated players.The NFL appeared to take a different tack. Starting on Sunday, the league said it would only test unvaccinated and symptomatic players,The Associated Press reported. Vaccinated players would no longer be tested weekly."It's not about loosening our standards," said Dr. Allen Sills, the league's chief medical officer, according to the AP. "If anything, we're just bringing a higher degree of precision in measuring ourselves against a more precise ruler."Sills encouraged players to report symptoms to the league, get booster shots and limit their exposure to the virus,according to NFL Network reporter Mike Garafolo.Scientists believethe omicron variant spreads fasterthan any previous variant, and it is also better at causing breakthrough infections in vaccinated people. What's unclear is whether it's more or less severe than previous strains, such as delta.Professional sports leagues haven't required players to be vaccinated, but a vast majority of players have gotten the shot. The leagues also have rigorous testing regimes in place, and experts say that means it's possible the high number of infections they're recording now is a harbinger of what's to come for the population at large."I do worry that it's possible — maybe not likely, but possible — that these sports leagues' numbers are a bit of a canary in the coal mine for the rest of us,"  Zach Binney, a sports epidemiologist at Oxford College of Emory University,told NPR on Wednesday.It's unclear how long this phase of increased caution will last. But the NHL and the players' union, citing disruptions to the schedule and the pandemic, also said they were "actively discussing" player participation in the 2022 Winter Olympics, set to begin in Beijing, China, in February.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Matthew S. SchwartzNIH Director Dr. Francis Collins holds up a model of the coronavirus as he testifies before the Senate in May. Collins is retiring as director of the NIH.Sarah Silbiger/APhide captionNIH Director Dr. Francis Collins holds up a model of the coronavirus as he testifies before the Senate in May. Collins is retiring as director of the NIH.On his last day as director of the National Institutes of Health, Dr. Francis Collins' frustration was evident."I get upset because people point to anecdotes of somebody who got sick even though they had been vaccinated and say, 'There, you see, it doesn't work,' " CollinstoldFox News Sundayguest host Bret Baier. "That's way too simplistic."As the omicron variant of COVID-19 is set to wend its way through the American population — wreaking particular havoc on the unvaccinated — 50 million vaccine-eligible Americans still haven't gotten even one dose of COVID-19 vaccine. "How did that happen?" Collins asked. "How did we get all of this so mixed up with social media, misinformation, and political insertion into the discussion? This is the thing for me on my last day as NIH director that I find particularly frustrating."Collins' last day comes as the virus is ravaging the unvaccinated — who often tend to be Fox News viewers. An NPRinvestigationthis month found that vaccination rates are far lower in counties that strongly supported Donald Trump during the last presidential election. People in counties that went 60% or higher for Trump have been almost three times as likely to die from COVID-19. Studies have found that Fox News viewers aremore likelyto believe COVID-19 misinformation."We've got to remember, this is the enemy," Collins said, holding up a model of the virus. "It's not the other people in the other political party. It's not the people on Facebook who are posting all sorts of crazy conspiracies. This is the enemy. We in this country have somehow gotten all fractured into a hyper-polarized, politicized view that never should have been mixed with public health. It's been ruinous and history will judge harshly those people who have continued to defocus the effort and focus on conspiracies and things that are demonstrably false."On CBS'Face the NationSunday, Collins warned that with its dozens of mutations, the omicron variant "has the properties to potentially be evasive of the vaccines." Collins urged the 60% of Americans who are eligible for a booster shot but haven't gotten one to take action.Collins also noted that only one available monoclonal antibody treatment — made by GlaxoSmithKline and Vir Biotechnology — seems to be effective against the omicron variant. Regeneron's cocktail — known as REGEN-COV — has "diminished potency" against omicron, the companyacknowledgedlast week.GSK-Vir's treatment "still sticks to the spike protein that omicron has," Collins said — key to protecting people against the virus. There is a push to produce more of that treatment, Collins said, adding that health officials will have to save that treatment for people who are at higher risk.Collins also acknowledged the news fromPfizerthat two doses of its vaccine are likely not enough to protect children under 5. That delays plans to introduce vaccinations for kids aged 2-4, as Pfizer now studies the effectiveness of a three-dose regimen. "Really we ought to think about surrounding them with vaccinated people to keep them from getting infected," Collins said.Omicron is particularly concerning because of its "extraordinary" transmissibility, Dr. Anthony Fauci said on ABC News'This Week. Omicron has a "doubling time" of just 2-3 days, he said. That's the time it takes for the number of coronavirus cases todouble— and it's faster than delta, the current dominant strain in the U.S.Based on data out of South Africa, where omicron has already been running through the population, it appears that the omicron variant leads to less severe symptoms and requires less hospitalization. But that might be due to other factors, Fauci said, like "the fact that their population has so much experience with prior infections that it might be underlying immunity that's making it look like it's less severe."And even if omicron does turn out to be less severe than delta, the sheer number of expected omicron infections is likely to overcome the "slight-to-moderate diminution in severity," Fauci said, warning that U.S. hospitals "are going to be very stressed with people."Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

Emma BowmanNIH Director Dr. Francis Collins, seen testifying before a Senate subcommittee in May, on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. Collins' last day on the job is Sunday.Sarah Silbiger/APhide captionNIH Director Dr. Francis Collins, seen testifying before a Senate subcommittee in May, on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. Collins' last day on the job is Sunday.After spending more than 12 years as director of the National Institutes of Health, Dr. Francis Collins is retiring this weekend. But he's no less worried about the public health agency's latest pandemic curveball.As the omicron variant threatens record-breaking rates of infections in the U.S., Collins departs with a warning. If Americans don't take COVID-19 seriously, the country could see 1 million daily infections, he said."We cannot afford to let down our guard," Collins told NPR's Scott Detrow in an interview withWeekend Edition."I know people are tired of this," he said, acknowledging Americans' fatigue of having weathered almost two pandemic-stunted years. "I'm tired of it too, believe me. But the virus is not tired of us. It's having a great old time changing its shape every couple of months, coming up with new variants and figuring out ways to be even more contagious."Early datashows that while omicron has the ability to easily evade immune protection and booster shots, those infected may be less likely to experience severe disease and hospitalization.But it's too early to know how the highly mutated omicron will act in the U.S. compared to previous variants, said Collins. With omicron's 57 different mutations, he said, it's "almost like we're starting over with a different virus than where we began."According to scientists'most pessimistic projections, the U.S. could reach over a half-million average daily infections by the end of January — more than double last winter's peak.The outgoing director fears a worse situation."Even if it has a somewhat lower risk of severity, we could be having a million cases a day if we're not really attentive to all of those mitigation strategies," he said.Even the most optimistic scenarios could mean a strain on hospitals in many regions that are already squeezed by the delta surge.Collins notes that the Biden administration has at least60 emergency response teamson standby to support health care systems in the event of a crush of infections."I expect those surge teams are going to be busy — already that's been put in place in some instances because of delta — and I'm not going to be surprised if there's even more of a demand in the next month or two," he said.All in the last week, the rapid clip of omicron infections in the country has once again forced shutdowns of professional sports games, theaters, restaurants and schools. Some people are rethinking theirholiday travel plans.As for Collins' own plans, he says he'll be keeping a close eye. But at the moment, he's hoping to host a Christmas Day gathering with pandemic precautions in place."We were planning to invite some of the trainees at NIH who are far from home to come for a brunch on Christmas Day at our house if they're all fully vaccinated and boosted," he said. "Still planning to go forward, very carefully, with a small group, and everybody will be wearing masks except when they're eating."Ian Stewart and Kitty Eisele produced and edited the audio version of this interview.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

Kat LonsdorfAt New York Fashion Week earlier this fall, model Gigi Hadid coolly strutted the runway in shimmery gold lounge pants tucked into blue satin heels with a knotted green sequin button-down on top. Silver and gold chains ringed her wrists, a diamond choker rested around her neck and a bedazzled purse hung at her side.Nearly all of the looks designer Tom Ford sent down the runway for his spring 2022 collection were just as shiny — from a bomber jacket glimmering with golden chainmail to a floor-length silver sequin duster. And while his show may have been an extreme, it wasn't an outlier. The runways this fall were awash with shine.Models walk the runway for Tom Ford during New York Fashion Week in September.JP Yim/Getty Imageshide captionModels walk the runway for Tom Ford during New York Fashion Week in September."What caught my eye the most was this extravagance in all forms," says Jessica Testa, a reporter for The New York Times Style section, who was at the runway shows this fall. "Big color, big patterns. And, of course, sequins, sparkles, metallics and rhinestones."Testa says one thing was clear: None of the outfits were meant for staying home. They were meant to be seen.While glitz and glam pop up around the holidays every year, it's different this time, and likely to persist well into the spring. After nearly two years of living in sweats in the shadow of a pandemic, people — and fashion designers and brands — are ready to step out and catch the light.Models walk the runway during Gucci Love Parade in Los Angeles in November.(1) Amy Sussman/Getty Images; (2,3) Frazer Harrison/Getty Images for Guccihide captionModels walk the runway during Gucci Love Parade in Los Angeles in November."People know the world hasn't gone back to normal," Testa says. "Like, sure, we're post-pandemic, but we're also not really post-pandemic, right? But people are trying to go back to their lives and when the world around you is still very dark and you decide to dress to the nines, I think there's something very like middle finger in the air about that."It's not just the runways making a statement. Buyers are flocking to second-hand stores as well, scooping up every bit of glitter they can find. Shilla Kim-Parker is the CEO and co-founder of Thrilling, a massive vintage online marketplace, where she says they've seen the desire to shine play out big time."We're seeing folks having a lot of fun with what they're wearing — sequins, things that are shiny and bright, even chainmail," Kim-Parker says.A model shines in vintage clothing and jewelry.Oye Diran/Thrillinghide captionA model shines in vintage clothing and jewelry.The colors gold, silver and red represent nearly 30% of Thrilling's current sales, she says — a ten-times increase from last year. Statement jewelry is up five fold, while 80's clothing, with all its bold colors and over-the-top glam, is flying off the virtual shelves.But sparkle doesn't have to be big to count, Kim-Parker points out."I just bought some vintage rhinestone brooches because I was thinking even if I'm wearing a secondhand sweatshirt, you know, I want to bedazzle it in some way ... even if it's just for my little Zoom window," she laughs.A collection of vintage jewelry ready to add sparkle to any outfit.Oye Diran/Thrillinghide captionA collection of vintage jewelry ready to add sparkle to any outfit.This desire for a little (or a lot of) glam after so much darkness doesn't surprise fashion-watchers like Kate Bellman, lead fashion editor for Nordstrom, where there's a whole team working to predict trends.  She says they've been tracking the rise in glitter demand for quite a while."What I think is actually really cool about what we're seeing modern day in terms of the glam and the glitz and the sparkle, is that they really saw it coming in terms of the historical context from the roaring 20s," Bellman says.The sequined flapper dresses and rhinestone-encrusted headbands that we associate with the 1920s were a response to the 1918 flu pandemic, and the first world war. There was a lot of death, and people were finally ready to step out again and be seen. Feel familiar?Models walk the runway for Tom Ford during New York Fashion Week in September.JP Yim/Getty Imageshide captionModels walk the runway for Tom Ford during New York Fashion Week in September.What Bellman says is particularly special this time around, though, is that people are not saving the shine for parties — especially since parties are getting cancelled again."I mean, I've seen people in sequin tops at the grocery store. I've seen people in sparkle shoes on public transportation," she says. "I think we're just starting to see it be more reflective of how people feel, just wearing it sort of in this versatile way — which I, as a fashion person, find so exciting, inspiring."Jessica Testa says it might be easy to write off this trend as simple, sparkly fun — but you'd be missing a big part of it."There is some real emotion behind it," she says. "There's some defiance, there's some irony, there's some real persistence that I appreciate."So pull out those sequins. Bust out that bedazzler. Roll on the glitter.Persist, and shine.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Mary Louise KellyAyen BiorGabe O'ConnorNoah CaldwellThe arrival of the omicron variant in New York City has resulted in a rise in cases and the return of long lines for COVID testing. It has many people comparing this December to March 2020 when the pandemic began.Kena Betancur/AFP via Getty Imageshide captionThe arrival of the omicron variant in New York City has resulted in a rise in cases and the return of long lines for COVID testing. It has many people comparing this December to March 2020 when the pandemic began.This week has been one of mass cancellations. Between pro sports games and theaters shutting down and some schools and colleges moving to remote learning again, it has many people comparing this December to March 2020, when the pandemic began.But despite those feelings, Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health, says this is not March 2020 all over again. And, he adds, he isn't panicking.Jha spoke with NPR'sAll Things Consideredto talk about how to navigate this season of the pandemic, including holiday travel and parties.We're not. We're in a very, very different place. It can feel like that ... but the big difference between March 2020 and where we are [now] is we have all sorts of tools to keep people safe to get on with our lives. And it doesn't mean the pandemic is over. We have some challenges ahead, but we know how to manage them and we can do it.Well, if we aren't careful and if we aren't thoughtful about our approach, then we can get into a lot of trouble. But remember, the main issue is in the past, infections always preceded hospitalizations, which preceded deaths, and that has been a pattern we've seen over and over again. We finally can break that cycle.I don't think we have the ability to completely suppress infections unless we go into a massive lockdown, which we're not going to do. But we have the ability to prevent those infections from turning into hospitalizations and deaths. And that's what we should be focused on. We have an ability to prevent those infections from disrupting our lives, shutting our schools. That's what we should be focused on. And I really think we can.First of all, I think we should all be clear, we are going to see a very large wave of infections that will really get going, probably by the end of this month. And January will be a month where we will see maybe more infections than we've seen in any month throughout the whole pandemic.Some of it will happen in unvaccinated people, and that worries me a lot. But a lot of it will also happen in people who are partially vaccinated. People who have gotten two shots. Those people largely should do OK. Most of them will not end up getting particularly sick.We've got to get boosters into high-risk individuals. Actually, personally, I think we've got to get boosters into everybody. That will make an enormous difference in keeping people from what will feel like a really bad cold to turning into something more dangerous. And then we have tools like rapid tests, which we can use to get together safely.It is a challenge, but they're getting better. And again, I don't want to be too overly optimistic. Look, the challenges of the next six weeks are real and they are going to be difficult, but the tests are becoming more available. We're starting to see them show up more. They're getting a little bit cheaper. I think we can use these tests, get people boostered, avoid some really risky things like large indoor gatherings where people are eating and drinking and not that stuff. If we can avoid some of those, we can have a pretty good holiday season and we can get through January and February without too much disruption to our lives.Not large parties, no. You know, we had one at our school of public health and we actually canceled it because we just didn't feel like having 200 people inside eating, drinking together made a lot of sense.Travelers arrive for flights at Newark Liberty International Airport late last month. Flying domestically should be relatively safe as long as precautions are taken.Spencer Platt/Getty Imageshide captionTravelers arrive for flights at Newark Liberty International Airport late last month. Flying domestically should be relatively safe as long as precautions are taken.Yeah, I think so, especially if you're vaccinated and boosted and people around you are. Obviously, on the planes you won't know people's vaccine status, but planes are not particularly dangerous ... And one more caveat, which is domestic. International travel is more complicated because of travel restrictions and quarantine issues. But domestic travel, I think over the holiday season for vaccinated, boosted people, I think it's pretty reasonable to do.Yeah, absolutely. So what we know about kids is kids' risk of being infected is really driven by the adults around them. So if you're in a community that's highly vaccinated or certainly for the rest of the family is vaccinated, I think it's pretty reasonable. If you want to add an extra layer of protection, you can add testing, get one of those rapid tests for the child, maybe before they see Grandma or Grandpa. I think that helps. I would, in fact, encourage that, but I don't think kids under 5 have to be isolated just because they're not vaccinated yet.Testing schoolchildren on a regular basis can be preferable to instituting quarantines.Angela Weiss/AFP via Getty Imageshide captionTesting schoolchildren on a regular basis can be preferable to instituting quarantines.I think this is about time. The evidence on this has been very clear for several months. I'm really happy to see the CDC encourage this. We do not need to be doing mass quarantining right now. We have kids across America at home waiting out a 14-day quarantine. Totally unnecessary. The evidence is clear. If those kids are getting tested on a regular basis, they can come back to school safely. It does not cause big outbreaks or big spread.No, they're not. And the reason is because I really do think we're going to break this link between cases and hospitalizations and deaths. Look, I'm plenty worried. There are lot of elderly people who are not vaccinated. There are plenty of elderly people who are not boosted. I'm worried about what's going to happen with them and what the impact is going to be on our health care system. I'm worried about the fact that there's still so much misinformation out there that some people are going to take no precautions at all. I'm not saying we can just ignore the pandemic. I'm saying we're in a different place than where we were two years ago, and we have to remember that and we have to use those tools to get through the next couple of months.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Matthew S. SchwartzSecretary of Defense Lloyd Austin speaks during a media briefing at the Pentagon last month. The military branches have begun discharging people who refuse to get vaccinated against COVID-19.Alex Brandon/APhide captionSecretary of Defense Lloyd Austin speaks during a media briefing at the Pentagon last month. The military branches have begun discharging people who refuse to get vaccinated against COVID-19.Members of the U.S. military who haven't been vaccinated against COVID-19 are starting to face the consequences. Military officials announced this week that, after months of warnings, they have begun disciplinary actions — including discharge.The Air Force was the first of the branches to announce dismissals, saying Tuesday it had discharged 27 people who refused to get the vaccine. On Thursday, the Marines said it had discharged 103 troops. The Army has reprimanded 2,700 soldiers and said it will begin discharge proceedings in the new year. And the Navy this week told commanders to start "administrative separations" for "vaccine refusers."But the vast majority of the armed services have followed orders. In the Navy, 98.4% of its force fully vaccinated, according to the Associated Press. The Air Force says 97.5% have received at least one shot. Army officials said that 98% of active-duty forces have received at least one dose of the vaccine, while 96% — nearly half a million people — are fully vaccinated. About 95% of Marine Corps forces have gotten at least one shot.That still leaves potentially thousands of active-duty soldiers who might be forced out in the coming weeks or months. Although that would slightly reduce the size of the military, the Pentagon says it's important to keep that in perspective.In the Army's case, for instance, less than 1% of the force has refused the vaccine. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin is most concerned with "the readiness of the force and the importance of the vaccine," Pentagon press secretary John Kirby told reporters. Getting the vaccine, he said, is "the best way to protect themselves and their units.The Pentagon began requiring members of the military to get vaccinated in late summer. There are "active discussions" within the Pentagon about requiring booster shots as well, Kirby said. The booster shot provides strong protection against the omicron variant of the coronavirus, medical officials have said.Thousands of troops across the services have asked for exemptions from the vaccine requirement, some of which have been granted. Medical exemptions are often available when,for instance, someone is allergic to a vaccine ingredient, or has an underlying health condition that could cause adverse reactions.At least 12,000 service members have asked for religious exemptions, none of which have yet been granted. Religious exemptions are "always rare," Kirbytold reportersearlier this month."This has absolutely nothing to do with trampling on the religious liberties of our men and women in uniform," he said. "It's about a military medical requirement to keep them safe, to keep their family safe, to keep their units safe."The Pentagon has also required all National Guard members to get vaccinated against the coronavirus, but some states have pushed back. Republican governors from five stateswroteto the defense secretary this week arguing that the Pentagon didn't have the authority to discharge Guard members for refusing the vaccine.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

If you're planning to take the kids to see Santa this year, experts say it's safest to keep everyone's masks on.Caroline Seidel/picture alliance via Getty Imageshide captionA Santa Claus in Germany wears a surgical mask in December 2020. If you're planning to take the kids to see Santa this year, experts say it's safest to keep everyone's masks on.Each week, we answer frequently asked questions about life during the coronavirus crisis. If you have a question you'd like us to consider for a future post, email us atgoatsandsoda@npr.orgwith the subject line: "Weekly Coronavirus Questions." See an archive of our FAQshere.My kids are so over seeing Santa Claus through Zoom. Can I bring them to the mall this year for the real deal?Unfortunately, sitting on Santa's lap is almost a comical example of what NOT to do during the pandemic, saysDr. Abraar Karan, an infectious disease physician at Stanford University."All it takes is one person to be very infectious," he says.The recipe for disaster can go something like this, he says: An unknowingly infected kid whispers his holiday wish list to Santa, along with COVID aerosols. Santa – whose mask doesn't fit well, due to the beard — gets an asymptomatic case and continues launching kid after kid off his lap, potentially passing the virus onto them. Then, all those kids too young to be vaccinated or wear a well-fitting mask go home to people congregating for the holidays.Fortunately, there are some simple precautions that could make an in-person visit possible. Make sure everyone going is vaccinated if possible and wearing good-quality masks, saysDr. Jill Weatherhead, assistant professor of adult and pediatric infectious diseases at Baylor College of Medicine.Consider the virus numbers in your area. Keep your visit short and sweet. And investigate the specific protocols at your mall. Some places require Santa and other staff working the photo booth, including photographers and other holiday characters, to be vaccinated. Most malls allow kids to take a physically distanced picture instead of sitting on Santa's lap. Some malls require everyone to wear masks. And some require parents to reserve a spot for their kid's photo op in advance to help avoid over-crowding in the photo area.You might be tempted to have Santa and your kid remove their masks for the photo – but experts say it's safest to keep them on. "In general, a few seconds in most circumstances will not be enough to transmit," Karan says — "but with SARS-CoV-2, we are constantly surprised."As for Weatherhead, she says she has decided this year to take her children — a 6-year-old who is vaccinated, and a 4-year-old — to meet Santa in person. Last year, the kids could only view Santa from afar at an outdoor drive-by parade.At her housing community where the Santa event takes place, Weatherhead says there are protocols about physical distancing. There is a limited number of people who can be in the photo area at any given time. Also, in Houston, where she lives, "the COVID case numbers are low now, so it's safer for us."But her kids, she adds, will not be sitting on Santa's lap.As for other traditions, such as mistletoe? Don't even think about hanging it at a gathering involving anyone other than immediate family, she says.I'm boosted, but not everyone in my extended family has been vaccinated. Is it safe to attend the annual family holiday gathering?Unfortunately, a booster shot is not a free pass for risky behavior, says Weatherhead. In fact, she says, emerging evidence suggests three jabs is now what's needed to better protect against omicron, compared to two jabs for the original strain.Socializing indoors with a mix of vaccinated and unvaccinated people is a higher risk activity, she says. The question comes down to how much risk you're willing to accept."You need to make sure you feel safe and are in an environment that is right for you," she adds.There are ways to make the gathering a bit safer. You can move the party outdoors. Require guests to take a rapid COVID test before coming to the party. Wear masks when they're not eating or drinking. And increase ventilation by opening up windows and doors — or set upportable air cleanersinside the home if you live in a cold climate.But Weatherhead warns that these measures won't necessarily make the party "risk-free"That likely means that anyone at high risk of COVID-19 will want to avoid being indoors with unvaccinated folks, says Karan. If you're boosted and not at high risk, he adds, your chances of getting a severe case of COVID is unlikely — though it's too early to say how boosters impact long COVID, the lingering symptoms that can persist months after a coronavirus infection.In any case, your best bet is to bring the topic up with the party host and your family members ahead of time, says Weatherhead, and discuss a plan to mitigate risk at the gathering."I recommend erring on the side of communication, being up front and having honest conversations about keeping everyone safe so it's fun for everyone and people feel respected and comfortable," she says.Just be prepared to make alternate plans if not everyone in the family wants to comply.Are the side effects from the booster different from the side effects from the first two jabs? And do they last longer? I got boosted six weeks ago, and my arm still hurts. Should I be concerned?No new side effects have been noted in people getting boosters."They're the same side effects that were identified previously, mild side effects that usually last 1 to 2 days," Weatherhead says.Those include pain, redness and swelling at the injection site, chills, fatigue, headache and fever — and, in the case of Moderna,a rash on the arm 5 to 9 days later.If you had one of the very, very rare severe or allergic reactions to your first jabs, for example,anaphylaxis, you'll want to talk to your doctor before getting boosted, she says. The doctor may recommend a different type of booster shot and a longer monitoring period right after you get jabbed.And if your arm hurts for months? That's extremely unusual, Karan says."There's no robust evidence to show that boosters would give you long-lasting side effects," he says. "But there will be anomalies — it's possible to have a longer inflammatory reaction [in the arm where you got the shot]. I've never seen it, but I won't say it's impossible."It's so rare, though, that it's not something for the general public to worry about. And it's more likely that it's unrelated to the booster, Karan adds. "You could trip over your shoelace the day after your booster," but that doesn't mean the booster caused you to trip.You can report anything you believe could be an adverse effect to theVaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, a program co-managed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, says Weatherhead. The system helps monitor the safety of newly licensed vaccines.Sheila Mulrooney Eldred is a freelance health journalist in Minneapolis.

Scott NeumanA child, with parent in tow, arrives to receive the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine for children 5 to 11 years old at London Middle School in Wheeling, Ill., last month.Nam Y. Huh/APhide captionA child, with parent in tow, arrives to receive the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine for children 5 to 11 years old at London Middle School in Wheeling, Ill., last month.Pfizer-BioNTech announced Friday that they will expand ongoing clinical trials of their COVID-19 vaccine in children to include a third dose for participants as young as 6 months old.Testing a third dose will cause a delay in submission of data to regulators to authorize use in the U.S. In the fall, Pfizer's CEO said the company expected to have data for this age group by the end of 2021. Now, the company says that they would expect to file results in the "first half of 2022" if trials are successful.The companies said two doses did not produce a robust immune response in kids 2 to 5 years old.The companies, which produced the first vaccine against coronavirus infection authorized for use in the U.S., said they had made the decision "following a routine review by the external independent Data Monitoring Committee," which acts as a watchdog over the clinical trials."The study will now include evaluating a third dose of 3 [micrograms] at least two months after the second dose of the two-dose series to provide high levels of protection in this young age group," the companies said in astatement."No safety concerns were identified and the 3 [microgram] dose demonstrated a favorable safety profile in children 6 months to under 5 years of age," they said.So far, the Food and Drug Administration has only authorized the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for emergency use in childrenaged 5 and older.Research has indicated that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is less effective against rapidly spreading omicron variant than for previous strains of the virus. However, a booster dose has been shown to add significant protection. Earlier this week, Modernaannounced similar resultsfor its vaccine.Last month, the FDA authorized athird booster doseof either vaccine for all U.S. adults."The data are illustrating the impact of a booster and that our vaccine works best as a primary regimen of three doses," Pfizer's chief scientific officer, Mikael Dolsten, said on a conference call, according to Reuters.Pfizer also said it was developing a vaccine tailored to combat the omicron variant of the virus — which has spread rapidly around the globe in recent weeks. The company hopes to start clinical trials on the updated omicron-specific vaccine in January.Pfizer also said 30 million of a planned 80 million treatment courses of itsPaxlovid antiviral pillwill be available in the first six months of 2022.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Anya KamenetzA nurse tests a student for COVID-19 at Brandeis Elementary School in Louisville, Ky.Jon Cherry/Getty Imageshide captionA nurse tests a student for COVID-19 at Brandeis Elementary School in Louisville, Ky.At a White House briefing on Friday, Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said schools should limit quarantines by requiring testing for unvaccinated close contacts of a confirmed COVID-19 case.It's a practice known as "test to stay.""In the 'test to stay' protocol, there's increased testing of close contacts after a COVID-19 exposure, and that testing needs to be at least twice in the seven-day period after exposure," Walensky explained. "If exposed children meet a certain criteria and continue to test negative, they can stay in school instead of quarantining at home."The announcementelevates and updatesexisting guidance that some schools around the country have already been following. It could save, collectively, tens of millions of school days for students – assuming the typical 10- or 14-day quarantine – as the omicron variant spreads in the United States.Walensky cited two new CDC studies conductedin Los AngelesandLake County, Ill., providing evidence that so-called "test to stay" is effective in limiting the spread of COVID-19 in schools that have masking policies. Students or staff who have been exposed are monitored for symptoms as well as being tested; they are allowed in school only if asymptomatic.In the Los Angeles study, 1,635 schools that did not use "test to stay" lost an estimated 92,455 in-person school days to quarantine between Sept. 20 and Oct. 31. No days were lost to quarantine among the 432 schools using "test to stay". And the incidence of COVID-19 was similar between the two groups of schools.Alena Zachery-Ross is the superintendent of schools in Ypsilanti, Mich. Her district adopted a "test to stay" policy as of the beginning of this school year. She said she's heard of students in neighboring districts quarantining multiple times and missing 30 school days or more."I have nurses doing testing every day, Monday through Friday from 9 to 4," she said. "We wanted to take that barrier away from parents, like, how do you get off work, or make that appointment with CVS even in the evening?"Her priority is student learning time. But, she says, there are wrinkles.Some of her students choose to stay home anyway when exposed because of fear of the virus or hesitancy about the test itself. "A lot of people are nervous about being tested ... They're not sure what's in the swab, and they don't feel comfortable. So they're out of school."And it is a huge commitment of resources and time for schools to offer so much testing – resources and time that are in short supply, as schools around the nation are reporting record staff shortages and burnout. This will be the major barrier for "test to stay" policies to overcome if they are to spread widely.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Vanessa RomoScott HensleyDoses of the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine are stacked in boxes at the McKesson facility in Shepherdsville, Ky., on March 1.Pool/Getty Imageshide captionDoses of the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine are stacked in boxes at the McKesson facility in Shepherdsville, Ky., on March 1.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention accepted advice from a panel of experts to recommend the use of the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines over the Johnson & Johnson jab, following growing concerns about rare blood clots.The advisers said Thursday that vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna should be preferred by all adults, who may be at greater risk for developing severe blood clots from the J&J vaccine than those under age 18. Some committee members said the J&J vaccine should remain available for people who prefer it.The recommendation was prompted by the occurrence of a rare and sometimes fatal blood-clotting problem called thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS). Earlier reports of the issue addressed cases ofcerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), a type of TTS.In a statement, Johnson & Johnson said it "remains confident in the overall positive benefit-risk profile" of its vaccine."The safety and well-being of those who use the Johnson & Johnson vaccine continues to be our number one priority," said Dr. Mathai Mammen, head of drug research and development at Johnson & Johnson, inthe statement. "We appreciate today's discussion and look forward to working with the CDC on next steps."The CDC said the problem is rare, but it has been seen at a rate of about one case in every 100,000 doses given to women 30 to 49 years old — the group at highest risk. About 15% of cases of TTS have been fatal, according to CDC data.Thesymptoms of TTSvary, but they can include headache, blurred vision, fainting or loss of consciousness, loss of control over movement in part of the body and seizures.In April, the CDC and the Food and Drug Administrationrecommended a temporary pausein use of the vaccine after six cases of the rare blood clots were seen in the United States. Later that month, the agencies rescinded the pause after an analysis of available data showed that the benefits of the vaccine outweigh its risks. Since then, more data has been gathered confirming the initial reports of blood clots.The J&J vaccine was authorized by the FDA as a one-dose vaccine, compared with the two doses for  the vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer. But the advantage of a one-dose vaccine for some people has been eroded by a CDC recommendation in September that people who got the J&J vaccine receive a booster two months later.More than 16 million people in the U.S. have been immunized with a shot of the J&J vaccine. More than 870,000 have received a J&J booster.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Jon HamiltonResearchers are learning that the coronavirus can infect neurons and may cause lasting damage in some cases.Kateryna Kon/Science Sourcehide captionResearchers are learning that the coronavirus can infect neurons and may cause lasting damage in some cases.Months after a bout with COVID-19, many people are still struggling with memory problems, mental fog and mood changes. One reason is that the disease can cause long-term harm to the brain."A lot of people are suffering," saysJennifer Frontera, a neurology professor at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine.Frontera led a studythat found that more than 13% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients had developed a new neurological disorder soon after being infected.  A follow-up study found that six months later, about half of the patients in that group who survived were still experiencing cognitive problems.The current catalog of COVID-related threats to the brain includes bleeding, blood clots, inflammation, oxygen deprivation and disruption of the protective blood-brain barrier. And there's new evidence in monkeys that the virus may also directly infect and kill certain brain cells.Studies of brain tissue suggest that COVID-related changes tend to be subtle, rather than dramatic, saysGeidy Serrano,director of the laboratory of neuropathology at Banner Sun Health Research Institute. Even so, she says, "Anything that affects the brain, any minor insult, could be significant in cognition."Some of the latest insights into how COVID-19 affects the brain have come from a team of scientists at theCalifornia National Primate Research Center at UC Davis.When COVID-19 arrived in the U.S. in early 2020, the team set out to understand how the SARS-CoV-2 virus was infecting the animals' lungs and body tissues, saysJohn Morrison,a neurology professor who directs the research center.But Morrison suspected the virus might also be infecting an organ that hadn't yet received much attention."Early on, I said, 'let's take the brains,' " he says. "So we have this collection of brains from these various experiments and we've just started to look at them."One early result of that research has generated a lot of interest among scientists."It's very clear in our monkey model that neurons are infected," says Morrison, who presented some of the research at theSociety for Neuroscience meetingin November.Neurons are the brain cells that make thinking possible. But studies of human brains have produced conflicting evidence on whether these cells are being infected by the virus.The monkey brains offer an opportunity to learn more because they come from a close relative of humans and are easier to study and scientists know precisely how and when each animal brain was infected.The monkey model isn't perfect, though. For example, COVID-19 tends to produce milder symptoms in these animals than in people.Even so, Morrison says, scientists are likely to find infected human neurons if they look closely enough."We're looking at individual neurons at very high resolution," he says, "so we can see evidence of infection."The infection was especially widespread in older monkeys with diabetes, he says, suggesting that the animals share some important COVID-19 risk factors with people.In the monkeys, the infection appeared to start with neurons connected to the nose. But Morrison says that within a week, the virus had spread to other areas in the brain."This is where you get into some of the neurologic symptoms that we see in humans," he says — symptoms such as cognitive impairment, brain fog, memory issues and changes in mood. "I suspect that the virus is in the regions that mediate those behaviors."That hasn't been confirmed in people. But other researchers have found evidence that the virus can infect human brain cells.Adraftof a study of brains from 20 people who died of COVID-19 found that four contained genetic material indicating infection in at least one of 16 areas studied.And, similar to monkeys, the virus seemed to have entered through the nose, says Serrano, the study's lead author."There's a nerve that is located right on top of your nose that is called the olfactory bulb," she says. That provides a potential route for virus to get from the respiratory system to the brain, she says.Serrano says the virus appears able to infect and kill nerve cells in the olfactory bulb, which may explain why many COVID patients lose their sense of smell — and some never regain it.In other brain areas, though, the team found less evidence of infection.That could mean that the virus is acting in other ways to injure these areas of the brain.For example, studies show that the virus can infect the cells that line blood vessels, including those that travel through the brain.  So when the immune system goes after these infected cells, it could inadvertently kill nearby neurons and cause neurological problems, Serrano says.COVID-19 can also damage the brain by causing blood clots or bleeding that result in a stroke. It can damage the protective cells that create what's known as the blood-brain barrier, allowing entry to harmful substances, including viruses. And the disease can impair a person's lungs so severely that their brain is no longer getting enough oxygen.These indirect effects appear to be a much bigger problem than any direct infection of neurons, Frontera says."People have seen the virus inside of brain tissue," she says. "However, the viral particles in the brain tissue are not next to where there is injury or damage," she says.Frontera suspects that's because the virus is a "bystander" that doesn't have much effect on brain cells. But other scientists say the virus may be cleared from brain areas after it has caused lasting damage.Researchers agree that, regardless of the mechanism, COVID-19 presents a serious threat to the brain.Frontera was part of a team thatstudiedlevels of toxic substances associated with Alzheimer's and other brain diseases in older COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized."The levels were really high, higher than what we see in patients that have Alzheimer's disease," Frontera says, "indicating a very severe level of brain injury that's happening at that time."It's not clear how long the levels remain high, Frontera says. But she, like many researchers, is concerned that COVID-19 may be causing brain injuries that increase the risk of developing Alzheimer's later in life.Even COVID-19 patients who experience severe neurological problems tend to improve over time, Frontera says, citing unpublished research that measured mental function six and 12 months after a hospital stay."Patients did have improvement in their cognitive scores, which is really encouraging," she says.But half of the patients in one study still weren't back to normal after a year. So scientists need to "speed up our processes to offer some kind of therapeutics for these people," Frontera says.Also, it's probably important to "treat that person early in the disease rather than when the disease has advanced so much that it has created damage that cannot be reversed," Serrano says.All of the researchers mentioned that the best way to prevent COVID-related brain damage is to get vaccinated.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

California is exempting San Francisco from a rule that takes effect requiring all people to wear masks indoors.Haven Daley/APhide captionA sign is displayed at a COVID-19 vaccine site in the Bayview neighborhood of San Francisco on Feb. 8, 2021. California is exempting San Francisco from a rule that takes effect requiring all people to wear masks indoors.The state of California says the city of San Francisco is exempt from the state's newly reinstated mask mandate — requiring everyone to wear a mask indoors.San Francisco Department of Public Health said Tuesday the city will continue to allow those who are fully vaccinated to remove their masks in gyms and workplaces, even as the state's reinstated mandate requires masks to be worn indoors, regardless of vaccination status. The statewide mandate took effect Wednesday."This refinement acknowledges the hard work of the people of San Francisco throughout the pandemic, including the ways in which we have maintained reasonable protections heading into the holiday season," the San Francisco Department of Public Health said in atweet.According to thedepartment, about 86% of eligible San Francisco residents have received at least one vaccine dose, with more than 753,000 residents being vaccinated.So far, California has administered62 million dosesof the COVID-19 vaccine."It's a recognition of all of the thought and care that San Francisco residents have been putting into staying as safe as possible," Dr. Susan Philip, San Francisco's health officer toldthe Associated Press.California Gov. Gavin Newsomannouncedthe news of the reinstated indoor mask mandate on Monday as cases of the coronavirus in the state have jumped up 47% in the past two weeks.State officials had previously lifted the mask mandate on June 15 for residents who were vaccinated."We know people are tired and hungry for normalcy. Frankly, I am too," California Health and Human Services Secretary Dr. Mark Ghaly told the AP. "That said, this is a critical time where we have a tool that we know has worked and can work."The statewide indoor mask mandate is scheduled to last until at least Jan. 15, 2022.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

People vaccinated with the Moderna vaccine likely need a booster to keep up their protection against the new omicron variant of the coronavirus.Chip Somodevilla/Getty Imageshide captionMaryland National Guard Spc. James Truong administers a Moderna COVID-19 vaccine on May 21 in Wheaton, Maryland. People vaccinated with the Moderna vaccine likely need a booster to keep up their protection against the new omicron variant of the coronavirus.Updated 5:00 p.m. ETThere's more mixed news about the power of vaccines to protect people against the omicron variant — this time about the Moderna vaccine.A preliminary study made public Wednesday studied blood samples in the lab from 30 people who had gotten two Moderna shots, and it found that the antibodies in their blood are at least about 50 times less effective at neutralizing the omicron variant of the coronavirus.Previous research had indicated the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is also less protective against omicron."The antibodies that people make after they get the standard two inoculations of the Moderna mRNA vaccine are 50 times less effective against omicron than they are against the original form of the virus," saysDavid Montefiori, a virologist at Duke University who helped conduct the study.But there was good news too. An additional 17 people in the study had received a Moderna booster. And the antibodies in their blood were highly effective at blocking the omicron variant — essentially about as effective as they are at blocking the delta variant, Montefiori says."What these results are telling us is that if omicron becomes a dominant variant, it's going to become even more important that people get their boost," Montefiori says.That would especially be important for elderly people and people with health problems that put them at increased risk, he says.Thesefindings are similarto those of studies done in labs on the blood of people who had gotten the Pfizer vaccine. Those also showed that people's antibodies were markedly less potent against omicron.Thelatest study,which has been released on a preprint server but has not yet been reviewed by other scientists, involved testing antibodies in the blood of vaccinated people against a "pseudovirus," which is a virus created in the lab to mimic the mutations found in the omicron variant.Based on the findings, Montefiori says a new vaccine specifically targeting omicron probably won't be needed. During a White House briefing Wednesday, Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health echoed that, both for the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines."Our booster vaccine regimens work against omicron. At this point, there is no need for a variant-specific booster," Fauci said.Scientists are doing similar experiments testing the Johnson & Johnson vaccine alone, as well as the J&J vaccine with a Pfizer booster, and expect to have some results by early next week.Public health experts are alarmed by the omicron variant because it has more mutations than any previous SARS-CoV-2 mutants and appears to be the most contagious variant yet.Originally spotted in South Africa, the variant is now spreading quickly around the globe. It has already been detected in at least 33 U.S. states and appears to be spreading fast. Thelatest estimatefrom the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is that omicron already accounts for about 3% of the samples the agency has analyzed, which is about a sevenfold jump from a week earlier.The variant is already far more common than that in some parts of the country, such as in the New York and New Jersey area, where it's showing up in 13% of cases, according to the CDC.Omicron spreads so fast that it's on track to overtake delta and become the dominant variant in the U.S. within weeks, raising fears it could accelerate the delta surge already underway."We could be facing very severe surges, very severe strains on our health care systems under the worst-case scenarios," saysLauren Ancel Meyersof the University of Texas at Austin, who has been modeling the possible impact of omicron on the United States."I'm worried," she says. "We don't want to be caught unprepared."Data coming out of South Africa and the U.K. indicates that vaccinated people can still catch the omicron variant and can still end up in the hospital, but may not get as sick. But there are many questions about whether that would be the case in the U.S., where there aren't necessarily as many people who have added protection from natural exposure to the virus.Nevertheless, the variant could still overwhelm the health system."While as a public health community we are still learning about the severity of cases caused by the omicron variant, modeling shows that even if it is less severe, the sheer number of cases that could come from a variant with the level of transmissibility that we are seeing in other countries could overrun our health care system resources, especially if it coincides with the current delta wave and flu season," saysAdriane Casalottiof the National Association of County and City Health Officials.An earlier version of this story misspelled David Montefiori's last name as Montefiore.An earlier version of this story misspelled David Montefiori's last name as Montefiore.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

The region has among the lowest vaccine rates and highest number of COVID-19 infections in the country.Police said they targeted five members of the Telegram group and that after searches of the sites "the initial suspicion was confirmed."A spokesman for the State Criminal Police Office (LKA) Saxony said five residences and one workplace were searched and that police confiscated weapons, parts of weapons and crossbows, according toSüddeutsche Zeitung.The raids followprotestsagainst new COVID-19 restrictions and plans to make vaccinations mandatory for people working in hospitals, nursing homes and other medical practices beginning in March. The protests are supported by the far-right Alternative for Germany party (AfD), whichenjoys considerable support in Saxony, according to Deutsche Welle.The alleged plot against Kretschmer also follows death threats against other German politicians over COVID-19 policies, as well asthe country's head of infectious diseases.Nearly 107,000 people in Germany have died since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and since late October the country has seen a dramatic spike in infections and deaths from the virus.In his first major address to Germany's parliament, the Bundestag,Chancellor Olaf Scholzsaid the country was fed up with anti-vaccine radicals."We will not put up with a tiny minority of uninhibited extremists trying to force their will on our entire society," he said.A version of this story originally appearedin the Morning Edition live blog.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

"We understand that life is too good to lose. This is how we live with COVID."Portugal has one of the world'shighest vaccination ratesagainst the coronavirus and almost all its adults are fully vaccinated.The shots appear to protect people from serious illness and offer some protection against catching the virus, although breakthrough infections do happen. Daily infections have been rising again in Portugal and across Europe.Scientists are watching how Portugal and other highly vaccinated countries will fare against the coronavirus' new omicron variant."Portugal feels a little bit like a lab experiment now," says Maria Manuel Mota, executive director of the Institute of Molecular Medicine in Lisbon. "This virus is not going away. We have tried to prepare for that."Portugal learned this lesson the hard way. A year ago, the coronavirus brought the country to its knees.The public health system was nearing collapse as ICUs filled with seriously ill COVID-19 patients. As Christmas and New Year approached, the government advised everyone to protect themselves by wearing masks."That did not happen," Mota says. "And then, in January and February, we had thousands of people dying."When NPR visited the capital, Lisbon, last month, the cobblestoned old town was packed with shoppers as well as tourists photographing intricately tiled buildings.Claire Harbage/NPRhide captionAt the same time, Portugal's vaccine program was in trouble. A hospital administrator appointed to run the vaccination rollout resigned after allegations of unfair access to vaccines and delays in supplies.Then the government turned over the reins to a high-ranking naval officer. Vice Adm. Henrique Gouveia e Melo showed up for work wearing combat fatigues."I said, we are at war, and this is a war against the virus, so what side [do] you want to be on?" Gouveia e Melo told NPR last month, during an interview in his nautical-themed office. You are either "with the virus, 'cause you are crazy and you are helping the virus to spread? Or are you on our side, the community?"The vice admiral, tall and gray-bearded, became a fixture on TV news programs. He usedStar Warsreferences to make his points, comparing those who spread disinformation about the virus to Darth Vader and the Siths.Vice Adm. Henrique Gouveia e Melo in his office.

"So I say, look, be a Jedi to protect yourself, your family and also all of us."He says he assembled a "team of Jedis" to lead the vaccination drive. They included doctors and military tacticians who coordinated with municipal leaders and Health Ministry authorities on the vaccination drive. The team helped expand existing vaccination centers and set up new ones in stadiums.Soon, Portugal had hundreds of COVID-19 vaccine sites administering more than 150,000 shots per day. When Gouveia de Melo visited the centers, those waiting in line for their shots applauded. Once he faced anti-vaccine protesters who were shouting unfounded claims that the shots would end up killing people, even though clinical studies showed the vaccines are safe. The protesters got into his face as TV cameras rolled."These guys were shouting like crazy people, 'Murderer, murder! Genocide! Killer!'" he recalls. "And I said in a very calm way, 'Murderer or killer is the virus, together with these crazy people, these people whose minds are still in the 12th century.'"Left: Vice Adm. Henrique Gouveia e Melo points to a COVID chart in his office; Right: People hold themselves in a trolley in Lisbon, Portugal.Claire Harbage/NPRhide captionThe naval officer's message worked in part because there aren't many anti-vaxxers in Portugal. Mota, the molecular biologist, says that has to do with the country's history."The country was very poor until the '70s," she says. "We had a dictatorship. We still remember high child mortality."After the four-decade-long right-wing dictatorship fell in 1974, Portugal built a robust public health system. Vaccines eradicated outbreaks of polio, measles and other serious diseases."All these anti-vaxxers in other countries like the Netherlands or Austria or Germany or even the United States," she says, "maybe they just forgot what life was like before vaccines."Passengers on Tram 28, a popular and scenic trolley, stare out at people gathered on the seaside in Lisbon, Portugal.Claire Harbage/NPRhide captionAlmost 88% of Portugal's more than 10 million people arefully vaccinatedagainst the coronavirus, and booster shots are well underway.That's helping life here get somewhat back to normal."Well, normal is not the same normal," Gouveia e Melo says.

But even he's been surprised by the impact of coronavirus variants."I had a sense [in early 2020] that this was going to be a prolonged and very damaging pandemic," he said. "What I didn't understand at the time, and has surely influenced how I think it's going to keep going, is the role the variants played. I think the variant issue right now continues to be the 210-mile-an-hour curve ball that we don't really yet understand completely."The U.S. death rate recently worsened: the rolling seven-day average for daily COVID-19 deaths has been above 1,000 since Dec. 3, according to theCenters for Disease Control and Prevention. That's far higher than June and early July, when for weeks the rolling average for deaths held below 300. That changed in late summer, when the delta variant took hold, driving new infections.With parts of the U.S. enduring sharp rises in cases and deaths, the worst-hit counties include Maricopa, Ariz., with more than 60,000 new cases and 671 deaths over the past 28 days, according to Johns Hopkins University'sCOVID-19 dashboard.Experts now warn that the more transmissible omicron variant could bring a new spike, just as many Americans have been hoping to enjoy a relatively normal holiday season with friends and family.So far, reports of vaccines' effectiveness against omicronis mixed."Certainly the data is concerning about the decreased effectiveness of two vaccine doses against omicron," Chu said, "but booster doses seem to overcome that to a degree. And as with all the other surges, it will be the unvaccinated who will become seriously ill, hospitalized, and fill the hospitals past capacity."Osterholm notes health care systems are urging people to get vaccinated, warning that people who need emergency care could find an overloaded system when they rush to hospitals"In many places right now in these states with these prolonged surges, we are beyond bending. We're broken, in some of these institutions," he said.Returning to his curveball analogy, Osterholm said, "If the variants are 210-mile-an-hour curve balls, omicron is about a 500-mile-an-hour curveball."One scenario, he said, is that the variant could cause less severe illness overall — but still force many patients to go to hospitals at once, because of high transmission rates."I think that over the course of the next three to four weeks, we're going to see a real impact from omicron. The question is what will that impact be? And we just don't know yet."With many people in the the world unable and/or unwilling to be vaccinated, both Chu and Osterholm say more variants will emerge in the future.Since early 2021, the pandemic's death toll has doubled. Here's a recap of the milestones the U.S. has hit this year:"It's embarrassing for the country that led on so much of the science around immunology, virology, and vaccinology, to have stumbled in vaccine implementation and rollout to its population," Chu said. "And it's just really terrible to think that so many of those deaths were completely preventable."Thefirst coronavirus vaccine shotwas administered in the U.S. one year ago. As of this week, theCDC says72% of the U.S. population has had at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, although the amount of people who are fully vaccinated only recently nudged over 60%. Despite the vaccines' arrival, COVID-19 has killed more Americans in 2021 than it did in 2020.Among older adults, the median age of COVID-19 deaths has "dropped precipitously," Osterholm said, especially when vaccination status is taken into account."One of the things that I find troubling is the fact that people often write off [the death toll] as just, 'This is a bunch of old people,' " Osterholm said.Using Minnesota as an example, Osterholm said the median age of unvaccinated people who die from the disease in the state is more than 20 years younger than vaccinated people who die from it."The unvaccinated are becoming more and more of a challenge at much younger ages, and we're seeing many more 20-, 30-, 40- and 50-year-olds unvaccinated dying from COVID," he said.As for when the pandemic might end, many epidemiologists say it could require adapting to COVID-19, noting how difficult it will be to eradicate the disease completely."I think we are going to have to get to a point of learning how to coexist with this virus," Chu said."There is a very large focus on vaccines, but continued masking and testing needs to be emphasized to prevent community spread," Chu said. "I would like to see a universal vaccine and mask mandate, and easy and cheap testing to be available. That is what has worked in other countries, and we should be doing that here."As for how we might build on the lessons of COVID-19 when another pandemic strikes, the focus should be on minimizing harm, Osterholm says."Pandemics are going to happen," he said. "They're like tornadoes, hurricanes and earthquakes. What we're going to need to do is be able to respond to them, so that we minimize the damage. And that's the key message right now, I think, is what do we do to do that?"Osterholm points to challenges surrounding vaccines — from how they're delivered to how they're accepted by the public."That's a huge issue," he added.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Jonathan FranklinCornell University announced the closing of its Ithaca, N.Y., campus due to a rise in cases of the omicron variant of the coronavirus.sach1tb/Flickrhide captionCornell University announced the closing of its Ithaca, N.Y., campus due to a rise in cases of the omicron variant of the coronavirus.Cornell University is shutting downits Ithaca, N.Y., campus and is moving to "alert level red" — its highest alert level — due to what officials say is a rapid spread of COVID-19 cases among students.As of Tuesday afternoon, the campus reported 469 active student cases of the coronavirus and that, for the week of Dec. 6, about 3% of tests were positive among the students tested, according toCornell's online COVID-19 dashboard.In an onlineletterto students, Cornell University President Martha Pollack said  the campus's COVID-19 testing lab team detected evidence of theomicron variant"in a significant number of Monday's positive student samples."Because of the closures across campus, Pollack said all final exams for the fall semester will be moved online and all campus activities, including campus athletics, are canceled. The school's libraries are also closed for students.In addition, the school's recognition ceremony for fall graduates, scheduled for Dec. 18, is canceled.In response to an increase in COVID-19 cases and evidence of the Omicron variant, Cornell is moving to Alert Level Red and announcing a number of immediate measures, including final exams moving online as of noon, Dec. 14.https://t.co/Scj0FZBEuA"While I want to provide reassurance that, to date, we have not seen severe illness in any of our infected students, we do have a role to play in reducing the spread of the disease in the broader community," Pollack said.Joel Malina, vice president for university relations, told NPR in an emailed statement that for the past 20 months, the university has developed and followed a "science-based approach" to COVID-19 decision-making.The decisions, which involve ongoing modeling and surveillance testing, helped campus officials identify positive cases early and minimize the spread of the coronaviruson campus, Malina said."Virtually every case of the Omicron variant to date has been found in fully vaccinated students, a portion of whom had also received a booster shot. We have not seen evidence of significant disease in our students to date," he added.Malina said campus officials are assisting those students who have tested positive to complete their mandated 10-day isolation periods and will help students who have tested negative to return home safely for the winter break.Cornell's last day of classes was Dec. 7,  according to its campus academic calendar. The fall final-exam period for students is scheduled from Dec. 11 to 18.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Michaeleen DoucleffA woman is vaccinated against COVID-19 at a clinic in Johannesburg on Dec. 6. A new study from South Africa looks at the effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine in preventing infection and severe disease.Shiraaz Mohamed/APhide captionA woman is vaccinated against COVID-19 at a clinic in Johannesburg on Dec. 6. A new study from South Africa looks at the effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine in preventing infection and severe disease.The new coronavirus variant, called omicron, was first identified in South Africa only about a month ago and is already spreading quickly in Europe and North America. It has an exceptionally high number of mutations, and those mutations appear to make it more transmissible than the delta variant.Now scientists in South Africa have just released the first data looking at how well the vaccines will work against the omicron variant. And the news is mixed.The study comes from researchers at South Africa's largest private health insurer, called Discovery Health, and the South African Medical Research Council. In the study, described at a press briefing on Tuesday, scientists analyzed data from 78,000 people likely infected with omicron. Nearly half of them had received two doses of the Pfizer vaccine.The study focused on the Pfizer vaccine. The Moderna shot isn't available in South Africa. In general, though, the two vaccines have behaved quite similarly against new variants, with the Moderna vaccine slightly more effective.In the population in the South African study, the Pfizer vaccine's effectiveness against infection dropped down to about 30% for the omicron variant, compared with about 80% against the variant before omicron, the scientists reported.That means the Pfizer vaccine reduces a person's risk of getting infected by about 30% compared to somebody who's not immunized.By comparison, in the delta surge that began this summer in the U.S., the mRNA vaccines — Pfizer and Moderna — had an effectiveness of about 60% to 70% against infection, several studies have found.With 30% effectiveness, there will be very many breakthrough infections.But this new study does offer really good news when it comes to vaccine protection against severe disease: That dropped a bit but not nearly as much as protection against infection.The researchers found that two shots of the Pfizer vaccine still offered about 70% protection against hospital admission because of COVID-19 in the population examined in the study. That's a drop from 90% observed during the previous surge in South Africa when the delta variant dominated. But 70% indicates the vaccine is still working well to keep people out of the hospital."We are encouraged that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine continues to offer high levels of protection from severe COVID-19 illness," Discovery Health CEO Ryan Noach said in a press statement.In addition, the data suggests that the protection seems to hold up in people with some risk factors such as diabetes and heart disease, as well as in older people.But these findings come with a huge caveat.In South Africa, many people have been exposed to the coronavirus. Some studies estimate that up to 90% of South Africans have been infected over the course of the pandemic. The study didn't take this into account.Scientists are starting to think that for many people, getting infected is almost like an extra dose of the vaccine. The infection really helps the immune system learn how to fight off COVID-19 — similar to the way the vaccine does.And several studies have shown that if you've had an infection and then get two doses of an mRNA vaccine, you are much better protected compared to somebody who had only the vaccine.So for people who've had only two shots — and not a prior infection — the vaccine's effectiveness in helping fight off an infection could be lower than 30%.That said, boosters could be beneficial. Although this new study from South Africa didn't look at the effect of a third shot on preventing infection or severe disease by the omicron variant, a recentstudyfrom Goethe University Frankfurt did suggest that the booster could help restore some of the vaccine's effectiveness, especially in the short term after receiving the third shot. Based on that data, scientists are saying that a third shot is the best way to ward off omicron and, for those with a breakthrough infection, of preventing severe disease.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

On Tuesday, Pfizer released promising data about a pill to treat COVID-19.Pfizerreleased additional dataabout its pill to treat COVID-19 that shows it was effective in preventing hospitalization and death when taken by people with mild to moderate illness within a few days of first symptoms.The medicine, called Paxlovid, is taken twice a day for five days in combination with a second medicine called ritonavir, a generic antiviral.The results from a study involving more than 2,200 people at high risk for developing serious COVID-19 found the drug reduced the risk of hospitalization or death by 89%, compared with a placebo, when taken within three days of first symptoms of illness. When taken within five days, the drug reduced the risk of hospitalization and death by 88%."If you would treat 100,000 patients of this type with Paxlovid, you would prevent more than 5,500 hospitalizations and save some 1,100 lives," Pfizer's chief scientific officer Mikael Dolsten tells NPR.Preliminary results from a second study showed a 70% reduction in hospitalization risk among several hundred people at lower risk for severe disease.The company also looked at the effect of the drug on suppressing the amount of virus in the body, the so-called viral load, and found it led to a tenfold drop compared with a placebo. A reduction in viral load could reduce people's infectiousness.Reactions to the drug and placebo were similar and most were mild, Pfizer said.Pfizer said it has submitted the results to the Food and Drug Administration. If the agency authorizes the medicine, the U.S. government has a contract with Pfizer to buy 10 million courses for $5.3 billion.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
The Associated PressSecretary of Defense Lloyd Austin speaks during a media briefing at the Pentagon in November.Alex Brandon/AP file photohide captionSecretary of Defense Lloyd Austin speaks during a media briefing at the Pentagon in November.WASHINGTON — The Air Force has discharged 27 people for refusing to get the COVID-19 vaccine, making them what officials believe are the first service members to be removed for disobeying the mandate to get the shots.The Air Force gave its forces until Nov. 2 to get the vaccine, and thousands have either refused or sought an exemption. Air Force spokeswoman Ann Stefanek said Monday that these are the first airmen to be administratively discharged for reasons involving the vaccine.She said all of them were in their first term of enlistment, so they were younger, lower-ranking personnel. And while the Air Force does not disclose what type of discharge a service member gets, legislation working its way through Congress limits the military to giving troops in vaccine refusal cases an honorable discharge or general discharge under honorable conditions.The Pentagon earlier this yearrequired the vaccine for all members of the military, including active duty, National Guard and the Reserves. Each of the services set its own deadlines and procedures for the mandate, and the Air Force set the earliest deadline. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has said the vaccine is critical to maintaining the health of the force and its ability to respond to an national security crisis.None of the 27 airmen sought a medical, administrative or religious exemption, Stefanek said. Several officials from the other services said they believe that so far only the Air Force has gotten this far along in the process and discharged people over the vaccine refusal.As a result, they were formally removed from service for failure to obey an order. Stefanek said it is also possible that some had other infractions on their records, but all had the vaccine refusal as one of the elements of their discharge.It is not unusual for members of the military to be thrown out of the service for disobeying an order; discipline is a key tenet of the armed services. As a comparison, Stefanek said that in the first three quarters of 2021, about 1,800 airmen were discharged for failure to follow orders.According to the latest Air Force data, more than 1,000 airmen have refused the shot and more than 4,700 are seeking a religious exemption. As of last week, a bit more than 97% of the active duty Air Force had gotten at least one shot.Members of the Navy and the Marine Corps had until Nov. 28 to get the shots and their Reserve members have until Dec. 28. Army active duty soldiers have until Wednesday, and members of the Army National Guard and the Reserves have the most time to be vaccinated, with a deadline of next June 30.Across the military, the vaccine reaction has mirrored that of society as a whole, with thousands seeking exemptions or refusing the shots. But overall the percentage of troops — particularly active duty members — who quickly got the shots exceeds the nationwide numbers.As of Dec. 10, the Pentagon said that 96.4% of active duty personnel have gotten at least one shot. The number plummets to about 74%, however, when the Guard and Reserve are included. According to the Centers for Disease Control, about 72% of the U.S. population 18 and older have gotten at least one shot.Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has made it clear that the Guard and Reserve are also subject to the mandate, and has warned that those who fail to comply risk their continuing as members of the military. But that has proven to be contentious.Oklahoma's Republican governor and the state attorney general have already filed a federal lawsuit challenging the military mandate for the state's Guard. Gov. Kevin Stitt — the first state leader to publicly challenge the mandate — is arguing that Austin is overstepping his constitutional authority.Stitt had asked Austin to suspend the mandate for the Oklahoma National Guard and directed his new adjutant general to assure members that they would not be punished for not being vaccinated.Austin rejected the request and said unvaccinated Guard members would be barred from federally funded drills and training required to maintain their Guard status.Oklahoma's adjutant general, Brig. Gen. Thomas Mancino, posted a letter on the state Guard's website, however, warning his troops that those who refuse the vaccine could end their military careers."Anyone ... deciding not to take the vaccine, must realize that the potential for career ending federal action, barring a favorable court ruling, legislative intervention, or a change in policy is present," Mancino wrote.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Nina TotenbergThe U.S. Supreme Court has turned away a challenge to New York state's  vaccine mandate for health care workers — a mandate that provides no exceptions for religious objectors. The vote was 6-3.This was the second time the court has refused to block such a state vaccine mandate for health care workers. As in an earlier case from Maine, New York  provides only one exemption from the mandate, and that is a narrow medical exemption for those who have suffered a severe allergic reaction after a previous dose of the vaccine or a component of the COVID-19 vaccine.That is the standard recommended by the CDC after finding that vaccines are safe for immunocompromised people, pregnant women and people with underlying conditions.The six-justice majority included the court's three liberals and three of its conservative justices, too — Justices Brett Kavanaugh, Amy Coney Barrett and Chief Justice John Roberts.They wrote no opinion, simply turning aside an emergency request asking the court to block the law.New York, like Maine before it, argued that the whole purpose of the mandate is to require high levels of compliance in order to protect patients from contagion and to stanch the pandemic as new variants arise.The effectiveness of broad mandates like this are perhaps best illustrated by a spreadsheet provided by the city of New York. It shows that before the mandate 60% of those working for the Fire Department were vaccinated. As of this week, the percentage was 94%.In its brief, the state noted that the COVID-19 vaccination rules are the same as preexisting vaccine requirements for measles and rubella that have been in effect for decades.The state agreed that where possible, federal law requires employers to provide reasonable accommodations for religious objectors, but it noted that does not require employers to offer objectors their preferred accommodation — namely a blanket religious exemption allowing them to continue working at their current positions unvaccinated.Dissenting were Justices Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch and Samuel Alito. Gorsuch, writing for himself and Alito, maintained that religious objectors are ineligible for unemployment compensation and that the state mandate "exudes suspicion of those who hold unpopular religious beliefs."Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Joe HernandezThe Delicate Arch in Arches National Park near Moab, Utah, is shown here in 2018. Next year, Arches will launch a temporary timed entry reservation system.Mark Ralston/AFP via Getty Imageshide captionThe Delicate Arch in Arches National Park near Moab, Utah, is shown here in 2018. Next year, Arches will launch a temporary timed entry reservation system.Visitors to Arches National Park in Utah will need to make reservations for staggered entry times starting in April of next year as part of a temporary program to cut down on crowding at one of the nation's most popular outdoor attractions.It's the latest park to set up such a system to deal with a gush of visitors that began during the COVID-19 pandemic."[O]ur goal is to better spread visitation throughout the day to reduce traffic congestion and visitor crowding," Patricia Trap, the superintendent of Arches National Park,said in a statement.The pandemic spurred an explosion of interest in America's outdoor spaces, especially national parks, where soaring visitation and a rise in vehicle traffic have worsened crowding at popular sites and strained federal resources.It's led to some unpleasant conditions at several parks with reports of litter and even human feces on trails.In response, Glacier National Park in Montana and Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado implemented timed entries at some locations.Officials hope the new timed entry reservation system at Arches can help with the spike in demand, too. The number of visitors to the park grew from 996,312 in 2009 to 1,659,702 in 2019 — a 66% increase — according to the National Park Service.Visitors whobook a reservationat Arches National Park beginning April 3 will be given a ticket with a one-hour window to enter the park between 6 a.m. and 5 p.m. Once they're in, parkgoers can stay as long as they like for the rest of the day. Officials will permit about 2,700 vehicles per day during the six-month pilot program.A few reservations will remain available for purchase the day before entry, and those with certain permits or other authorizations won't need reservations."We believe this will create a higher-quality experience while maximizing access for our visitors," Trap said.Data collected during the pilot program will help inform officials about future park policies, she added.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Allison AubreyNurse Sandra Lindsay, the first person in the U.S. to get the COVID-19 shot, serves as grand marshal of the Hometown Heroes Parade in New York City in July. The event honored essential pandemic workers.Cindy Ord/Getty Imageshide captionNurse Sandra Lindsay, the first person in the U.S. to get the COVID-19 shot, serves as grand marshal of the Hometown Heroes Parade in New York City in July. The event honored essential pandemic workers.When she rolled up her sleeve nearly one year ago on Dec. 14, Sandra Lindsay, a nurse at Northwell Health in New York, didn't realize she'd become the first person in the U.S. to get the COVID-19 shot — or that her life would change.She had signed up for the shot along with a bunch of colleagues following the emergency use authorization of the Pfizer vaccine."When I got there, I saw the cameras set up," says Lindsay. Within minutes, images and video footage of her getting the jab began circulating in media outlets around the globe.Her phone started buzzing. Her mom called first, then friends back in her home country of Jamaica. "It was just wild," she says, because everyone was so excited to see her face in the news.Since then, it has been a whirlwind.In July, sheserved as the grand marshalof New York City's Hometown Heroes Parade for front-line workers. Then she washonored by President Bidenat a White House ceremony for "becoming a shining example of exemplary civic service," according to a press statement.Meanwhile, she was completing her doctorate in health sciences while holding down her job as director of nursing for the critical care division at Long Island Jewish Medical Center, part of Northwell Health.But over the past year, Lindsay says she has been most passionate about encouraging people to get vaccinated — especially those who may be hesitant.Along the way, she's learned the secret to changing minds, and it starts with what happens in the heart.Lindsay gets her first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine on Dec. 14, 2020, becoming the first person in the U.S. to do so.Mark Lennihan/APhide captionLindsay gets her first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine on Dec. 14, 2020, becoming the first person in the U.S. to do so.If you're trying to persuade a hesitant friend or family member to get vaccinated, it's best to lead with love. Yes, love, she says."People need to feel love and not shame," she adds. Shaming someone is more likely to shut them down and it can be hurtful and destructive.If you're planning a holiday gathering and you're anxious about including an unvaccinated family member or friend, badgering or threatening them to get vaccinated is unlikely to work."Saying 'you can't come here' is not the answer," says Lindsay. Instead, "let them know you really want to spend time with them" — but that you also have concerns. Tell them the family would all feel safer if everyone gathering had done all they could to protect each other.For some people, not getting vaccinated is a matter of control. People who are resistant often say they don't want people telling them what to do."So turn it around," Lindsay says. She recently advised a colleague on how to deal with a grown son who was not vaccinated."Ask him to put himself in your shoes," Lindsay told her colleague. Pretend he's the parent. "Ask him how he would deal with it."This strategy can help prompt reflection, she adds. And it may help them see your main goal is to make sure everyone is safe and protected.You may want to pick a time and place for this conversation that is least likely to lead to confrontation, says Lindsay. So, not in front of family members, but perhaps on a walk with just you and the other person.This may also be a good time to ask the hesitant person if they have any unanswered questions about the vaccine. With so much misinformation, Lindsay says you don't know what's holding people back until you ask. To help answer their questions, point them to online resources that offer evidence-based answers or to a trusted health care provider.Despite continued hesitancy (72% of adults in the U.S. are now fully vaccinated), Lindsay believes there's been progress. For instance, polls show that compared to a year ago,vaccine hesitancy among Black adults in the U.S. has diminished.There's no single magic bullet to get to 100%, says Lindsay. "One strategy is not going to get us all there."But each person can influence those around them, she adds.Recently, she says, she was at the Jamaican Embassy and a woman came up to her. She recognized Lindsay and couldn't stop thanking her.The woman explained how she and her family were not planning to be vaccinated. But after seeing Lindsay on TV, the woman told her, "We all went and made an appointment. So I want to thank you so much for inspiring us."Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Will StoneThe first country to really get hit by omicron is South Africa.Before the new variant took off last month,coronavirus cases there were low – only several hundred per day in mid November.But by early December, the tally of daily infections had shot up to more than 4,500 — and genomic sequencing shows that omicron is to blame.What's more, the variant quickly swept through all regions of South Africa – and has now shown up in about 60 additional countries.Omicron hasn't yet triggered a global wave, but many scientists who are tracking its rapid spread believe it's only a matter of time.The reason for their concern?Omicron is starting to gain traction in countries where the pandemic looks very different from South Africa – places where the highly transmissible delta variant is currently dominant and where vaccination levels are relatively high.The clearest signs of trouble come from how quickly omicron is growing in Europe and the U.K., saysMatt Ferrari, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Dynamics and a professor of biology at Penn State University."Everybody in my industry is hopeful that we're being alarmist, but more than at any other point in the course of the whole pandemic, we know how bad it could be," he says.Early data show that one person who catches omicron is currently going on to infect two to four other people — that's at least twice as many as someone who gets the delta variant. The statistics come from countries like the U.K, Denmark and South Africa — all of which have robust surveillance systems in place for tracking coronavirus variants.And some expertsbelieve omicron is spreading even fasterthan that.The alarming pace of new infections is on par with how quickly the first, wild-type strain of the coronavirus spread at the beginning of the pandemic – back when there were no vaccines and everyone was susceptible."Now we're in a world where lots of people have immunity, either from previous infection or from vaccination, and we're seeing a pretty rapid growth rate over and above delta," says Ferrari.Indeed, the spread of omicron in the U.K., where about 70% of people are vaccinated compared to about 25% in South Africa, is a key reason scientists are worried.Although omicron infections only make up a small portion of the overall cases in the U.K., the forecasts are sobering. The country'shealth agency is warningthat omicron infections are doubling every few days – and could make up half of all cases there by mid-December."The quick steady spread is just a very clear signal that this variant can spread exponentially even in highly vaccinated populations," saysJeffrey Barrett, director of the Genomics Initiative at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, which tracks variants in the U.K.And the U.S. should take note: What the virus does in Europe, says Barrett, often foreshadows where the pandemic is headed on the other side of the Atlantic. "By next week, we will see clear evidence of an omicron wave in European countries, and I suspect the U.S. is at most a week behind that," he predicts.Exactly why omicron is spreading so quickly comes down to two key questions. Is this strain of the virus intrinsically more contagious — in the way that delta was compared to the variant that dominated before it arrived?  And second: is omicron also just better at escaping immune defenses – antibodies resulting either from prior infection or vaccines — which means there are more people who it can infect?It's possible the answer to both questions could be yes, although there's not enough data to say just yet."Looking at these early omicron cases, what we've anticipated from immune escape is turning out to be true and the [intrinsic] transmissibility seems to be at least that of delta," saysNathan Grubaugh, associate professor of epidemiology at Yale School of Public Health."I think we're going to see the vaccine's effectiveness against infection drop a lot," he says. This concern is not only based on how the variant is spreading in well-vaccinated places like Europe and reinfecting people who previously had COVID in South Africa, but also the many mutations onthe spike protein. Scientists believe those mutations could make omicron's spike protein more adept at evading the body's antibody defenses that prevent the coronavirus from infecting cells.This week, several preliminarylab studies seemed to confirm this fear. Researchers took blood from people who had received two shots of the Pfizer vaccine to see whether their antibodies could neutralize omicron as effectively as it could other strains of the virus. They found the antibodies had a lot more trouble disarming omicron.It's still too early to know just how much these findings translate into lower overall protection from the vaccine. Grubaugh is one of many scientists who say it's likely the vaccines will still help ward off severe disease because the immune system relies on other defenses like T-cells.But if omicron can more easily infect those with prior immunity, that will give it a distinct competitive advantage over delta because it will gain a foothold in populations where delta has trouble getting past the protection afforded by the vaccines. "It will probably end up replacing Delta — it's a little too early to tell how fast, but probably fairly quickly," he says.Some experts caution against early predictions about what may happen in a place like the U.S. based on the situation in other countries.John Moore,a professor of microbiology and immunology at Weill Cornell Medical School, says it's not at all certain that omicron will take over. "It's not just the transmissibility that matters, it's the ability to outcompete," he says. "Earlier variants like beta and gamma created short term angst, but they just fizzled away."In some countries, omicron could have more trouble competing because of higher immunity levels and the increasing push to get booster shots – whichearly data show may help stop omicron infections, saysWafaa El-Sadr, a professor of epidemiology and medicine at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health."This in and of itself may very much influence the trajectory of omicron in a country like the United States versus in a country like South Africa," she says. "But ultimately it's the more transmissible variants that takes over and circulates more widely, so that's what can be anticipated."Early reports from health officials and doctors in South Africa suggest the omicron wave of infections — while breathtaking in its speed — isn't yet causing the same level of severe disease as delta did when it hit the country. For example, ICU admissions are much lower.But many experts caution it's far too early to draw any firm conclusions. South Africa has a relatively young population, and many people had already caught the virus prior to omicron's emergence."The silver lining right now is we do not have any evidence that omicron is more severe," says Penn State's Matt Ferrari. Then again, he notes: "Everybody wants me to say it's milder, and we really just don't have convincing evidence that it is."Even if omicron does end up being less severe than delta and not as many people get very ill, Barrett of the Wellcome Sanger Institute says there's plenty of reason for concern given just how contagious it appears to be: "A small proportion of a huge number all at once can still overwhelm health care systems."This is especially true in a country like the U.S. where many hospitals are already filled with COVID-19 patients who are sick – not from omicron – but from delta.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Raquel Maria DillonFromThe wastewater facility in San Jose, Calif., processes sewage from about 1.4 million people and 22,000 businesses. The facility is part of a network of communities testing their wastewater for the omicron variant of the coronavirus.Raquel Maria DIllon/KQEDhide captionThe wastewater facility in San Jose, Calif., processes sewage from about 1.4 million people and 22,000 businesses. The facility is part of a network of communities testing their wastewater for the omicron variant of the coronavirus.Scientists have detected traces of omicron in wastewater inHouston,Boulder, Colo., and two cities in Northern California.It's a signal that indicates the coronavirus variant is present in those cities, and it highlights the useful data produced by wastewater surveillance research as omicron looms.Gathering this data requires careful collaboration among wastewater facilities, engineers, epidemiologists and labs. Scientists and public health officials say the data derived from samples of feces can help fill in the gaps from other forms of surveillance and help them see the big picture of the coronavirus pandemic, especially as a new variant emerges.In San Jose, Calif., it all starts in a tunnel under theSan José-Santa Clara Regional Wastewater Facility, which processes sewage from about 1.4 million people and 22,000 businesses.Chances are that in many parts of Silicon Valley, what goes down the toilet ends up at this large plant at the south end of the San Francisco Bay."Every time you flush, think of us," said Deputy Director Amit Mutsuddy as he gave a tour and cursed the seagulls that feed on the fat floating on top of raw sewage settling in long tanks.Staff members here retrieve samples daily as part of their regular lab work. They send additional test tubes by courier to get tested for the coronavirus at an outside lab that partners with Stanford University and theSewer Coronavirus Alert Network(SCAN).The SCAN project tests wastewater fromplants around Northern California. It's only one of manyon the hunt for the coronavirus, including omicron, in wastewateracross the U.S.and around the world.If there are strands of omicron RNA in that gunk, researchers can identify omicron at concentrations as small as one or two infections out of 100,000 people."As you can imagine, thousands of different kinds of diseases exist in the sewer. We work with them safely," Mutsuddy said. "It has not been anything new for us. It's just another coronavirus."Satya Nand, a staffer at San Jose's wastewater treatment plant, demonstrates how to take a sample of sludge for lab testing. One of the faucets at this sink spews primary sewage, so employees here can test regularly in their lab and send test tubes to another lab for coronavirus testing.Raquel Maria DIllon/KQEDhide captionSatya Nand, a staffer at San Jose's wastewater treatment plant, demonstrates how to take a sample of sludge for lab testing. One of the faucets at this sink spews primary sewage, so employees here can test regularly in their lab and send test tubes to another lab for coronavirus testing.Taking a sample involves dodging suspicious-looking puddles in a dimly lit tunnel that runs underneath the smelly tanks. Along a long hallway, there's a sink where the faucet spews globs of black sludge.What settles to the bottom of the tanks is called primary sewage and contains the solids that go down the pipes when the toilet gets flushed. Mutsuddy said it's easier to find virus there."The virus is lipid based, so it tends to stick to the fatty surfaces of solids," Mutsuddy said. "That's where we thought would be the maximum potential for capturing the virus if there is a trace of its RNA."This is step one of an important new early-warning system to understand the spread of the omicron variant, said Dr. Sara Cody, the health officer for Santa Clara County, where the San Jose plant is located."It makes sense to broaden our perspective and have many different surveillance tools spinning. We've seen which ones really bore fruit," she said. Wastewater surveillance "is one that has ended up being really helpful."Left: Wastewater treatment plant employee Satya Nand shows pipes carrying primary sewage through a tunnel under the sewage tanks.

Right: Plastic containers holding primary sewage are stored in a minifridge at the San José-Santa Clara Regional Wastewater Facility.

Researchers at Stanford University test sewage for the presence of omicron RNA. Right: Plastic containers holding primary sewage are stored in a minifridge at the San José-Santa Clara Regional Wastewater Facility. These samples are tested daily for coronavirus variants.Last week, researchers flagged four samples from wastewater plants in Sacramento and Merced for genetic mutations that looked like omicron.Stanford environmental engineering professorAlexandria Boehmsaid her team's first findings had some uncertainty while they hurried to recalibrate their testing to spot omicron RNA, rather than delta. There was a small chance that their tests were picking up on another rare variant.But they caught a lucky break: Omicron has a mutation in common with the alpha variant, which had been circulating several months ago. So they swapped out for older tests and spotted mutations characteristic of omicron.After another round of omicron-specific tests on Monday, Boehm was more sure. SCAN announced the discovery."Because we detected it with two different assays that target two different mutations in omicron, and since they were both detected, I'm very, very sure that omicron is present in the wastewater samples," she said.So far, the variant isn't showing up in clinical data in Sacramento and Merced counties. Public health officials have not identified omicron cases in those counties from PCR tests. In California, labs sequence about 20% of positive nose swabs, and that can take weeks.But even the initial assays from the sewage were enough to notify county public health officials in Sacramento and Merced that omicron is present in their communities.Boehm and her colleagues are confident in their testing — omicron is there — but they're not yet saying these four positive wastewater samples show community transmission of omicron, because that would require more data over a longer period of time."We're going to keep looking at it in these communities. If we see it continue to be present and start to go up, it's a really good indicator that it's circulating," said Krista Wigginton, an environmental engineering professor at the University of Michigan andanother lead researcher on the project.The team has seen steady concentrations of coronavirus RNA in Sacramento over the last two weeks and declining concentrations in Merced.The fact that researchers found the variant at all represents a leap in testing capabilities and wastewater surveillance technology.Cell biologist Tyson Graber, who's part of a team thatmonitors wastewater for the coronavirus in Ottawa, Canada, compares wastewater testing to looking at an "alphabet soup" of RNA from all kinds of organisms in the sludge and trying to recognize sentences that describe coronavirus variants."Thankfully we do know the language," he said.The challenge is that the RNA "letters" are combined with everything else that passes through your body, plus last night's pan drippings that got scraped down the kitchen sink — then multiply that by about several hundred thousand other people."We really understand the language of SARS-CoV-2 now at a rate that's unprecedented in biomedical research history," said Graber.The testing is both specific and sensitive. Plus, it's quick, he said."It's almost in real time. The turnaround time for our test for the alpha variant was under eight hours. This provided us a bit of a lead time in telling the community, 'Watch out: This new variant is here. It's increasing at this particular rate, and you should be watching yourselves and reducing your contacts.' "Cody, the health officer in Santa Clara County, which has not yet detected omicron in PCR tests or in wastewater, said the beauty of wastewater surveillance is that everyone in a given area gets tested.Like thechildren's booksays, everyone poops. Everyone contributes almost daily samples.Wastewater surveillance is a way to make up for deficiencies in other forms of testing. The data it captures includes people who are infected but don't have symptoms or don't get tested, as well as people taking at-home rapid tests, as they become increasingly available."If people aren't going out and getting a PCR test, those results in those cases aren't reported to us, and we won't see them in our case surveillance data. But we will still see it in our wastewater data," she said.Santa Clara County hasmore than a year's worth of wastewater datato  compare with results from PCR tests. Cody says they've learned when clinical data trends track wastewater concentrations."We started to see an uptick in a number of our sewer sheds just a little bit ago, and now we are beginning to see an uptick in our case count. So I think it gives us information a bit earlier," she said.An earlier version of this story misstated Tyson Graber's first name as Tyler.An earlier version of this story misstated Tyson Graber's first name as Tyler.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

While a majority of every other major religious group says their faith doesn't include a valid reason to refuse the vaccine, just 41% of white evangelicals believe the same.The findings in the survey – the largest one to track the intersection of the pandemic and religious beliefs — could be crucial to understanding how to encourage more people in the U.S. to be vaccinated, especially as vaccines become more available to children. PRRI CEO and founder Robert Jones says in a statement that the results show that many Americans believe religious liberty is not an "absolute" and that there should be a balance when it comes to the health of communities.Whether religious exemptions from the COVID-19 vaccine should be allowed resulted in a more divided array of answers. Just 39% of Americans support a blanket religious exemption excuse, meaning that anyone who says the vaccine is against their faith doesn't have to get it.But 51% of Americans are in favor of granting a religious exemption if the person has documentation from a faith leader saying that the vaccine goes against their religious beliefs.Interestingly, if the question was posed in the context of the government mandating vaccinations, 58% of Americans say people should be allowed to have religious exemptions from the vaccine.The survey also shows that it is quite effective when religious leaders speak up about vaccines. More than 50% of those who said they attend religious services regularly also said that a faith-based approach encouraged them to get vaccinated."When pastors encourage vaccination and mosques hold vaccine clinics, more people get vaccinated. Faith-based groups remain ready to play our role, but we need partners," IFYC president and founder Eboo Patel said."So many people in diverse religious communities believe that our bodies were created by god and we need to cherish and protect those,andthat we have an obligation to the common good," Patel told Megan Myscofski ofArizona Public Media.A faith-based approach could also be an effective way to get more children vaccinated.There is some evidence that faith-based approaches could encourage parents to get their children vaccinated. Just 16% of parents overall who are vaccine-hesitant or who refuse to get their kids vaccinated say they would be influenced by a faith-based approach — and that number jumps up to 29% for parents who are Christians of color.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Brian NaylorThe Senate has voted to overturn the Biden administration's rule that large private employers must require their workers to be vaccinated against COVID-19 or tested if they want to keep their jobs.J. Scott Applewhite/APhide captionThe Senate has voted to overturn the Biden administration's rule that large private employers must require their workers to be vaccinated against COVID-19 or tested if they want to keep their jobs.The Senate voted Wednesday night to overturn theBiden administration's proposed rulethat large private employers must require their workers to be vaccinated against COVID-19 or tested, or face losing their jobs.The vote was 52-48, with two Democrats — Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Jon Tester of Montana — joining all Republicans to overturn the regulation."Getting vaccinated should be a decision between an individual and his or her doctor. It shouldn't be up to any politician, especially in a mandate coming down from that highest authority, the president," Sen. Mike Braun, R-Ind., who led the effort to overturn the requirement, said during the Senate debate.The vote is largely symbolic. It seems unlikely that Democratic leaders in the House will take up the measure, and the White House has said President Biden will veto it if it reaches his desk.Republicans used a law called the Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to overturn federal regulations and requires just a simple majority vote in both the Senate and the House.Before the vote, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said he was strongly opposed to the measure and attacked supporters of ending the requirement as anti-vaxxers, although several specifically made the point they believed in vaccines, but not mandates."Some of the anti-vaxxers here in this chamber remind me of what happened 400 years ago when people were clinging to the fact that the sun revolved around the Earth," he said. "They just didn't believe science. Or 500 years ago when they were sure the Earth was flat."Braun, who said he was pro-vaccine and is vaccinated, called the Biden administration's requirement "the heavy hand of government" and "overreach." He said his phone had been ringing off the hook with calls from constituents opposed to the mandate."It's got Main Street America scared," he said.A September Gallup pollshowed a majority of Americans support private companies requiring their workers to get vaccinated. When broken out by party, an overwhelming majority of Democrats — 94% — favor such mandates; only 19% of Republicans do. AnotherGallup poll from Septembershowed that 56% of Republicans surveyed were fully or partially vaccinated and 92% of Democrats were.Red state governors and other Republicans have made opposition to vaccine mandates apolitical issue, and various requirements have led to a slew ofcourt cases. Last month, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, in New Orleans, ordered the administration to halt the mandate that employers with 100 or more employees require vaccinations or frequent testing, saying it raises "serious constitutional concerns."And on Tuesday, a district court judge in Georgia blocked the administration from requiring that all federal contractors be vaccinated by Jan. 4. An earlier court ruling blocked the administration from requiring that health care workers be vaccinated.White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the administration will "vigorously defend" the vaccine-or-testing mandate against legal challenges, which are expected to end up before the Supreme Court.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

The local health department is stepping up vaccination and booster shots as more cases of the omicron variant are being identified in the United States.Samuel Corum/Getty Imageshide captionPeople line up outside a free COVID-19 vaccination site that opened Friday in Washington, D.C. The local health department is stepping up vaccination and booster shots as more cases of the omicron variant are being identified in the United States.Moncef Slaoui, the former head of the Trump administration's Operation Warp Speed, says he's "cautiously optimistic" about how well existing vaccines will hold up against omicron, the latest coronavirus variant of concern.Omicron has more mutations than previous variants, with around 30 mutations on just its spike protein.That's worrying for virologists, who note that the spike protein is what vaccines use to "teach" our bodies to recognize the coronavirus.But Slaoui, who spent decades developing vaccines in the pharmaceutical industry before leading Operation Warp Speed's scientific work, says even if antibodies prompted by vaccines are less effective against omicron, other parts of the immune response could still help."It's a race between how fast the virus replicates and how fast the immune response gears up to eliminate it," he says.Vaccines prime the immune system and give it memory. "Then our capacity to mount a rapid immune response, I believe, will always be there to clear the virus. ... Maybe we get ill for a day or two. Maybe we have [a] cough. Maybe we have a bit of fever. But we're not going to have severe disease."Slaoui says the vaccines do more than just prompt the creation of antibodies. They also build a cellular response, which includes B cells and T cells. He says T cells in particular should be able to recognize and react to parts of the omicron variant, called epitopes, even if the spike protein is different."There's still a lot of potential T cell epitopes spread all over the sequence of the protein. And therefore, that's what makes me more cautiously optimistic," he says. "But clearly, we need to wait for the data."The public health community has known about omicron only for a few weeks, but already Pfizer and Moderna arespringing to actionto study potential omicron shots — just in case they're needed.Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla toldThe Wall Street Journalon Tuesdaythat the company could have an omicron-specific vaccine ready by March.When will it be clear if a new vaccine is needed?Slaoui remembers talking with colleagues at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases about how to respond to new variants. "It will be very important to have pre-established criteria with what triggers the fact that we start immunizing people again," he says.To him, that trigger is if the hospitalization rate among people who are vaccinated is significantly higher with a new variant than it was with the previous variant, because ultimately the vaccine is meant to reduce severe disease, rather than prevent every case of COVID-19.Norman Baylor, a former director of the Food and Drug Administration's Office of Vaccines Research and Review, agrees it's still not clear whether omicron will be too much for current vaccines. But if an omicron booster is needed, the FDA's handling of boosters offers clues as to how it would handle an omicron-specific shot."They required some clinical data ... immunogenicity data or antibody response data in individuals who had received the other vaccines," says Baylor, now thepresident and CEO of Biologics Consulting.Because this is a new variant, the agency may require a little more data this time around. "And so that's something that needs to be determined," Baylor says. "What additional information do we need to be comfortable?"Still, it shouldn't take as long as it took Operation Warp Speed and its member companies to research the original COVID-19 vaccines.This is where the mRNA technology used in the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines comes in. With an mRNA vaccine, it's easier to switch to a new variant than it would be with other kinds of vaccines. "The beauty of the technology is that it's so flexible," Slaoui says.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Joe PalcaDr. Naresh Aggarwal talks with Jennifer Bain, who volunteered for a study of Medicago's COVID-19 vaccine, in Toronto. More than 24,000 volunteers in six countries participated.Steve Russell/Toronto Star via Getty Imageshide captionDr. Naresh Aggarwal talks with Jennifer Bain, who volunteered for a study of Medicago's COVID-19 vaccine, in Toronto. More than 24,000 volunteers in six countries participated.A Canadian biotech firm is reporting positive results from a large study of its COVID-19 vaccine. What makes it unusual is that the key ingredient of the vaccine is grown in plants.Medicagohas already developed an experimental flu vaccine inNicotiana benthamian,a plant related to tobacco. When the pandemic struck, the company decided to try to make a COVID-19 vaccine.Now it appears those efforts have succeeded."This is an incredible moment for Medicago and for novel vaccine platforms," Medicago CEO and PresidentTakashi Nagaosaid in a statement.Vaccines work by showing the immune system something that looks like a virus, but isn't. Doing that allows the immune system to prepare itself in case the real virus shows up.In Medicago's case, the vaccine look-alike is something called a "viruslike particle" produced in plant cells that were given genetic instructions to make the coronavirus spike protein.The new results come from a study of more than 24,000 volunteers in six countries. Half got the vaccine, half a placebo. When the study reached approximately 165 cases of COVID-19 among the participants, a review of the results was triggered."We had about 74%-78% efficacy to prevent moderate and severe disease," Medicago medical officerBrian Wardtold NPR.The vaccine did slightly worse, closer to 70% efficacy, when looking at all COVID-19 cases, including milder ones.But there's something important to keep in mind, said Ward. The Medicago vaccine is based on a viruslike particle that looks like the original strain of the virus."All of the cases in this study were caused by these new variants," he said.Most of the cases were either the delta or gamma variants. Omicron hadn't yet appeared on the scene when the study was conducted. Ward says other vaccines have also had lower efficacy in combating the variants.As for side effects, Ward says, "pretty much everybody gets a sore arm." He says the sore arm is probably due to something called an adjuvant that's added to the vaccine to rev up the immune response. The adjuvant Medicago uses in its vaccine is made by GlaxoSmithKline.One thing the vaccine's researchers saw very little of was the fever that sometimes accompanies other COVID-19 vaccine shots.An advantage of the new vaccine is it does not need special freezers to store it. Standard refrigeration is adequate.Medicago plans to ask Canadian regulators for authorization to distribute its vaccine. In the meantime, they company is getting supplies of the vaccine ready."We have commercial lots being filled into vials as we speak," Ward says.But manufacturing capacity is an issue. Right now, the plants making the viruslike particles are grown in North Carolina. Ward says he's confident that the company will be able to supply the 76 million doses it already promised to the Canadian government. And he says the company is building a new facility with much greater capacity."And if we're still stuck with a COVID problem in by late 2023, then our major global facility will come on line in Quebec City," Ward says.Unfortunately, the world may indeed still be stuck with COVID-19 then.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

She added, "we expect that number to continue to increase."States that have detected the variant range from Hawaii to Texas to Massachusetts. The reports are part of a new surge in COVID-19 cases in the U.S. that now tops 100,000 cases per day.While officials and researchers are concerned about the transmissibility of the omicron variant, they also say it's too early to know what toll it might take in the U.S.Experts say it will likely be weeks before meaningful data about patient outcomes will emerge from South Africa, which first reported the variant. The country has seen an exponential rise in COVID-19 cases in Gauteng Province, the epicenter of the outbreak.In what could be a source of cautious optimism, the South African Medical Research Councilrecently saidthat over the past two weeks, the majority of patients in hospitals' COVID-19 wards have not required extra oxygen to breathe. The council also said that many of the omicron COVID-19 diagnoses arose from what is known as incidental findings — like when a patient is tested after coming to the hospital for other reasons, like a surgery or a pregnancy.There are also key differences in circumstances: in South Africa, for instance, only about a third of the eligible population has been fully vaccinated — far lower than in the U.S.Walensky said Tuesday that while the number of omicron cases is expected to rise in the U.S, the most recent data show that more than 99% of coronavirus samples that have been genetically sequenced showed the delta variant. She added that it is too early to know whether omicron will become dominant against delta or not.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

Winter months will make create new challenges. We’re not waiting for another#COVID19surge.We’re taking a preemptive strike:pic.twitter.com/rMgNDWnFa7Theaggressive new measuresalso require proof of vaccination with at least one dose for children ages 5 to 11 for entering in indoor dining, fitness and entertainment venues. Proof of vaccination is already required for people 12 and older to enter those places in New York City.De Blasio stressed that vaccination was the key to protecting against the virus, including for children."Don't end up in a situation where a child is left unprotected. I urge parents really strongly, get that vaccination. It's safe. It's been proven. Here's another incentive to do it," de Blasio said.The rules also bump up the vaccination level required to be in compliance with other city rules from one dose to two for adults receiving the two-shot mRNA Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines.De Blasio called the moves a "preemptive strike" to stop the spread of the coronavirus. The mayor said more information on the announcement is forthcoming from the city's health commissioner, Dr. Dave A. Chokshi.Driving the decision, de Blasio said, are concerns over winter weather and holiday gatherings causing more people to gather indoors — where transmission is more likely — and lingering unknowns about how transmissive and dangerous the omicron variant is.State health officials identified four cases of the omicron variant in the New York City area, New YorkGov. Kathy Hochul announced Thursday.De Blasio said community spread is assumed to be happening in the state."We knew it would come to New York state at some point,"Hochul said."We're ready for it. This is not surprising."Scientists are researching the omicron variant — which has already been found in at least 17 states in the U.S. — including the question of how much protection current vaccines may offer against it. Early evidence suggests omicron may be better at evading the immune system than previous strains have been, but officials say it's too early to tell if it causes a milder or more severe illness than other variants.The pervasive variant in the United States is still the delta variant, which has been causing about 100,000 cases a day. Case numbers are 50% higher now compared with a month ago,according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
The Associated PressSarah Gilbert, one of the scientists behind the Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, is warning that the next pandemic may more contagious and more lethal unless more money is devoted to research and preparations to fight emerging viral threats.Steve Parsons/APhide captionSarah Gilbert, one of the scientists behind the Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, is warning that the next pandemic may more contagious and more lethal unless more money is devoted to research and preparations to fight emerging viral threats.LONDON — One of the scientists behind the Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine is warning that the next pandemic may be more contagious and more lethal unless more money is devoted to research and preparations to fight emerging viral threats.In excerpts released before a speech Monday, Professor Sarah Gilbert says the scientific advances made in fighting deadly viruses "must not be lost" because of the cost of fighting the current pandemic."This will not be the last time a virus threatens our lives and our livelihoods,'' Gilbert is expected to say. "The truth is, the next one could be worse. It could be more contagious, or more lethal, or both."Gilbert will be speaking Monday night when she delivers this year's Richard Dimbleby lecture, named after the late broadcaster who was the BBC's first war correspondent and a pioneer of television news in Britain. The annual televised lecture features addresses by influential figures in business, science and government.Gilbert is set to urge governments to redouble their commitment to scientific research and pandemic preparedness, even after the threat of COVID-19 wanes."We cannot allow a situation where we have gone through all we have gone through, and then find that the enormous economic losses we have sustained mean that there is still no funding for pandemic preparedness,'' she said. "The advances we have made, and the knowledge we have gained, must not be lost."The U.K. lifted most coronavirus restrictions in July after a successful vaccination campaign, but is now waiting to see whether the new omicron variant will cause a setback. It has seen a high number of new daily infections this fall and still has the second-worst COVID-19 death toll in Europe — over 146,000 deaths — after Russia.The government has tightened travel testing and isolation requirements and barred visitors from South Africa, where the variant was first identified, and several other African countries including Nigeria.Health Secretary Sajid Javid said Monday more than 300 omicron cases had been confirmed in Britain, some with no links to international travel, and "we can conclude that there is now community transmission across multiple regions of England."Much remains unknown about the variant, including whether it is more contagious as some health authorities suspect, whether it makes people more seriously ill, and whether it can thwart vaccines."We can't say for certain at this point whether omicron has the potential to knock us off our road to recovery," Javid said.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Geoff BrumfielIn October, Eric Trump, son of the former president, spoke to a conference filled with anti-vaccine activists.Screenshot by NPR/Bitchutehide captionIn October, Eric Trump, son of the former president, spoke to a conference filled with anti-vaccine activists.In October,a conference filled with anti-vaccine activistsin Nashville, Tenn., received a high-profile political guest: former President Donald Trump's son Eric Trump.While portions of the younger Trump's half-hour address were typical political platitudes,some of his biggest applause lines came when he attacked COVID-19 vaccine mandates."Do you want to get a vaccine or do you not? Do you want to be left alone or not?" said Trump to a roaring audience.Still, Trump's emphasis was very different from those of many of the other speakers at the event, put on bylongtime anti-vaccine activistsTy and Charlene Bollinger.The day before Trump's speech, a homeopathic doctor named Edward Group stood on the same stage and suggested to the audience they should drink their urine as an alternative to getting vaccinated against COVID-19. Another speaker, Carrie Madej, said the vaccines contained microscopic technology designed to put "another kind of nervous system inside you." The true purpose of the vaccines, she claimed, was to turn humans into cyborgs.It's the sort of fringe views that kept political figures away from this conference in the past. But as America heads into midterm elections next year, the political right and the anti-vaccine movement are drawing ever-closer together. It's an alliance that promises to give both sides more power, butthe cost is potentially thousands of American lives.To understand what's going on, it's important to understand where the parties are coming from. The anti-vaccine movement was not always especially political. Some of the movement's leaders, such as Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the son of the late Democratic Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, have championed other liberal causes in the past."The truth is, I'm still a registered Democrat," says Del Bigtree, a well-known anti-vaccine activist. Even before COVID-19, he wrote and produced a documentary that falsely claimed childhood vaccines were linked to autism. But the message never caught on with the liberal audience he was targeting.Anti-vaccine activist Del Bigtree says he's seen his audience grow on the political right.The Washington Post via Getty Imageshide captionAnti-vaccine activist Del Bigtree says he's seen his audience grow on the political right.Instead, it seemed to tap into something on the political right. He still remembers the first time he noticed; it was after he was invited to speak at a conservative women's group in Texas."Clearly I was shocked as a lifelong liberal progressive that I was hugging and hanging out and having a great time with a bunch of extremely conservative mothers and grandmothers," says Bigtree.Bigtree has been banned from social media platforms like YouTube for making false claims about the dangers of COVID-19 vaccines. But as the pandemic has dragged on, his conservative audience keeps growing. Often he speaks at conferences alongside people who claim the election was rigged and promoters of QAnon conspiracy theories."Unless there's going to be a white supremacist on the stage or I find out that there's something that I truly find distasteful, then I just see that stage as simply an audience that I want to hear this message," says Bigtree.It's a numbers game. He wants to grow his movement, and he'll talk to anyone who will listen.GOP political operative Roger Stone has become a key connector between the pro-Trump political movement and anti-vaccine activists.Tasos Katopodis/Getty Imageshide captionGOP political operative Roger Stone has become a key connector between the pro-Trump political movement and anti-vaccine activists.On the other side of this alliance are far-right conservatives like Trump's former political adviser Roger Stone. Stone has been a Republican political operative since the 1970s, beginning with Richard Nixon's 1972 campaign. He's a longtime friend of Trump's and was convicted of lying to Congress about his knowledge of the 2016 Trump campaign's contacts with Russia. Trump pardoned Stone in December 2020.Stone, who spoke at the conference, says he's quite open to some of the ideas presented there about vaccines. But he also sees the shot asa powerful wedge issuethat Republicans can useto motivate conservative voters during next year's midterm elections.Citing public polls,Stone says that in particular, vaccine mandates are "highly likely" to be a campaign issue.Vaccine mandates have many features that make them a good issue to motivate conservative voters. It invokes a fight about the government regulation and personal liberty. But add in the apocalyptic views of anti-vaccine activists and the political power of arguments againstvaccine mandatesgets punched up to a whole new level.Some Republicans believe that vaccine mandates, such as this New York City requirement to enter museums and other public places, will be a potent political issue in 2022.Spencer Platt/Getty Imageshide captionSome Republicans believe that vaccine mandates, such as this New York City requirement to enter museums and other public places, will be a potent political issue in 2022.For example, Bigtree falsely claims that the COVID-19 vaccines are killing people and represent an existential threat to humanity: "I believe that this vaccine approach, this vaccine itself, this brand-new technology, is so incredibly dangerous, that we are actually putting our species at risk."It's the synergy between real politics and imagined dangers that is bringing the pro-Trump movement and anti-vaccine activists together.But the result of this union increasingly appears to bean even higher death toll from COVID-19, in part because it's causing many people to resist getting the shot."We find a huge correlation between belief in misinformation and being unvaccinated," says Liz Hamel, who heads public opinion research with the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan health care think tank.Between conservative media and GOP politicians, many Republican voters are being pummeled with bad science about vaccines almost daily.Kaiser's pollingfound that 94% of Republicans think one or more false statements about COVID-19 and vaccine safety might be true.Over the past eight months, Hamel has watched as Republican vaccination rates have fallen further and further behind the rest of America. While Republicans tracked with other groups in terms of vaccination rates earlier this year, Kaiser's research shows that now, an unvaccinated person is three times as likely to lean Republican as they are to lean Democrat.A new analysisby NPR suggests thatRepublicans are probably dying at a higher rate as a result. A nationwide comparison of 2020 presidential election results and COVID-19 death rates since vaccines became available for all adults, found that counties that voted heavily for Trump had nearly three times the COVID-19 mortality rate of those that went for Joe Biden. Those counties also had far lower vaccination rates.Loading...The analysis only provides a geographic association, and the individual political affiliations of those taken by COVID-19 remains unknown. "It's a little crass to ask someone what their loved one's ideology was after they passed away," says Charles Gaba, an independent health care analyst who has beentracking partisanship trends during the pandemic. But the strength of the association, combined with polling information, strongly suggests that Republicans are being disproportionately affected.When asked about Republicans' low vaccination rates, Stone was nonplussed. "Each person must make their own choice, God bless them." He went on to falsely claim that getting the vaccine actually enhances a person's chance of getting the disease. "So I guess I'd be more concerned if I were a Democrat," he says.Other conservative politicians try to avoid the thorny issue by keeping the conversation on the issue of choice. "It's not about whether the vaccines work or not," says Mark Burns, a conservative pastor closely affiliated with Donald Trump. "What matters for me is that you are stripping citizens [of] the right to choose what's best for their own life."Pastor Mark Burns spoke at the 2016 Republican National Convention in Cleveland. Now a congressional candidate, he recently spoke at a major gathering of anti-vaccine activists.Robyn Beck/AFP via Getty Imageshide captionPastor Mark Burns spoke at the 2016 Republican National Convention in Cleveland. Now a congressional candidate, he recently spoke at a major gathering of anti-vaccine activists.Burns, who is running for Congress in South Carolina, likened the choice about vaccination to smoking: "Cigarettes kill people every day, but yet you can go to the supermarket right now and buy it with no issue, that's their choice. If they want to go put cancer into their lungs, they have a right to do so." He felt his position would help him win the primary in the conservative district where he hopes to be elected.But for many Republicans who are concerned about public health, the willingness to parlay a lifesaving vaccine into political capital is disturbing."They just care about winning," says Annette Meeks, a lifelong Republican who heads the Freedom Foundation of Minnesota conservative think tank. "It's the worst element in American politics today."Meeks has seen the data on vaccines, and she's watched people she knows get sick. "To see people reject those vaccines based on pseudoscience or worse — lies — and to see lives lost is a tragedy beyond words," Meeks says.In addition to the moral failings, Meeks says embracing the anti-vaccine movement carries huge political risks for the GOP. That's because elections in states like Minnesota are won and lost in the suburbs. And those suburban voters tend to be vaccinated."I believe that the long-term consequences for the Republican Party will be a lot of those independent suburban voters will look askance at us and say, 'What is this all about? I got vaccinated, my whole family got vaccinated, and we're just fine.' "The risks for the Republican Party in lives and votes may be real, but the there is little downside for the other party in this alliance — the anti-vaccine movement.Del Bigtree says he's seeing more people at speaking engagements and getting millions of visitors to his website each week."We are growing in size, in numbers, in confidence and in finances," he says. And for now, his audience is clear: conservative America.Paige Pfleger of WPLN contributed to this report.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Daniel WoodGeoff BrumfielPeople protest a COVID-19 vaccine mandate for municipal workers on Oct. 28 in New York City. Polling, vaccination and mortality data all suggest that Republicans lag far behind in vaccination and are suffering the worst consequences as a result.David Dee Delgado/Getty Imageshide captionPeople protest a COVID-19 vaccine mandate for municipal workers on Oct. 28 in New York City. Polling, vaccination and mortality data all suggest that Republicans lag far behind in vaccination and are suffering the worst consequences as a result.Since May 2021, people living in counties that voted heavily for Donald Trump during the last presidential election have been nearly three times as likely to die from COVID-19 as those who live in areas that went for now-President Biden. That's according to a new analysis by NPR that examines how political polarization and misinformation are driving a significant share of the deaths in the pandemic.NPR looked at deaths per 100,000 people in roughly 3,000 counties across the U.S. from May 2021, the point at which vaccinations widely became available. People living in counties that went 60% or higher for Trump in November 2020 had 2.73 times the death rates of those that went for Biden. Counties with an even higher share of the vote for Trump saw higher COVID-19 mortality rates.In October, the reddest tenth of the country saw death rates that were six times higher than the bluest tenth, according to Charles Gaba, an independent health care analyst who's beentracking partisanship trends during the pandemicand helped to review NPR's methodology. Those numbers have dropped slightly in recent weeks, Gaba says: "It's back down to around 5.5 times higher."Loading...The trend was robust, even when controlling for age, which is the primary demographic risk of COVID-19 mortality. The data also reveal a major contributing factor to the death rate difference: The higher the vote share for Trump, the lower the vaccination rate.The analysis only looked at the geographic location of COVID-19 deaths. The exact political views of each person taken by the disease remains unknowable. But the strength of the association, combined with polling information about vaccination, strongly suggests that Republicans are being disproportionately affected.Recent polling shows thatpartisanship is now this single strongest identifying predictorof whether someone is vaccinated. Pollingalso showsthat mistrust in official sources of information and exposure to misinformation, about both COVID-19 and the vaccines, run high among Republicans."An unvaccinated person is three times as likely to lean Republican as they are to lean Democrat," says Liz Hamel, vice president of public opinion and survey research at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan health policy think tank that tracks attitudes toward vaccination. Political affiliation is now the strongest indicator of whether someone is vaccinated, she says: "If I wanted to guess if somebody was vaccinated or not and I could only know one thing about them, I would probably ask what their party affiliation is."It was not always this way. Earlier in the pandemic, many different groups expressed hesitancy toward getting vaccinated. African Americans, younger Americans and rural Americans all had significant portions of their demographic that resisted vaccination. But over time, the vaccination rates in those demographics have risen, while the rate of Republican vaccination against COVID-19 has flatlined at just 59%, according tothe latest numbers from Kaiser.By comparison, 91% of Democrats are vaccinated.Loading...Being unvaccinated increases the risk of death from COVID-19 dramatically,according to the CDC. The vast majority of deaths since May, around 150,000, have occurred among the unvaccinated, says Peter Hotez, dean for the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine.While vaccine hesitancy exists in many different groups, Hotez suspects that the deaths are "overwhelmingly" concentrated in more politically conservative communities. "How does this make sense at any level?" he asks.The consequences for individuals are real. Mark Valentine still remembers when his brother called him to tell him he had contracted coronavirus. Valentine is a trial consultant in North Carolina. His brother Phil, 61, was a well-known conservative talk show host in Nashville, Tenn., who often expressed skepticism about vaccination.Conservative talk radio host Phil Valentine (right), pictured with his brother, Mark (second from left).

Phil had been skeptical about COVID and the COVID vaccines, sometimes mocking them on his talk show. Earlier this year, he contracted the virus and died.Neither brother was vaccinated, and neither one was particularly worried about Phil's positive result. His brother said he was trying several alternative therapiescommonly promoted in conservative circles. "He said, 'I've got the ivermectin, I started it this morning, and I don't think it's going to be a big deal,' " Mark Valentine recalls. "And frankly I didn't think about it anymore."But a week later, Mark said he got a call from his brother's wife saying that the two were going to the hospital. "Before I knew it, he was in there and I couldn't get to him, couldn't talk to him," Valentine recalls. "His situation took a nosedive like you can't believe."Phil Valentine died in August about five weeks after he announced he had tested positive for COVID-19.Misinformation appears to be a major factor in the lagging vaccination rates. The Kaiser Family Foundation's polling shows Republicans are far more likely to believe false statements about COVID-19 and vaccines. A full 94% of Republicans think one or more false statements about COVID-19 and vaccines might be true, and 46% believe four or more statements might be true. By contrast, only 14% of Democrats believe four or more false statements about the disease.Loading...Belief in multiple false statements highly correlates with vaccination status, Hamel says. "If you believe that the vaccines can damage your fertility, that they contain a microchip and that the government is inflating the number of COVID-19 deaths, you're going to think really differently about whether to get vaccinated."Perhaps the most pernicious pieces of misinformation have to do with the perceived severity of COVID-19 itself. The most widely believed false statement was: "The government is exaggerating the number of COVID-19 deaths."Hamel says that underestimating the severity of COVID-19 appears to be a major reason why Republicans in particular have fallen behind in vaccination: "We've seen lower levels of personal worry among Republicans who remain unvaccinated," she says. "That's a real contrast with what we saw in communities of color, where there was a high level of worry about getting sick."Complacency around the risks of contracting COVID-19 certainly seemed to be a major reason why the Valentine brothers avoided vaccination. While not conspiracy theorists, they were staunch Trump supporters. The arrival of coronavirus just ahead of the presidential election of 2020 seemed like "the most fortuitous pandemic in the history of the world" for the Democratic Party, recalls Mark.Despite the media coverage, Phil Valentine didn't believe COVID-19 was serious as long as you were healthy: "He said, 'The likelihood of me getting it is low. In the unlikely event that I do get it, the likelihood that I will survive it is 99-plus %,' " Mark Valentine recalls.Vaccine researcher Peter Hotez is deeply troubled by the current state of affairs. A winter surge in COVID-19 cases is brewing, and the newly discovered omicron variant has the potential to make things far worse.He thinks the elements of the Republican Party that are endorsing anti-vaccine ideas need to take a big step back. "I'm not trying to change Republican thinking or far-right thinking," he says. "I'm trying to say: 'The anti-science doesn't belong; it doesn't fit. ... Just stop it and save lives.' ''Before his illness, Phil Valentine had sometimes promoted unproven alternative therapies and taken a mocking tone toward vaccination. As his situation deteriorated, Mark says the talk show host realized he needed to encourage his listeners to get vaccinated. Phil told his brother, "'My fear is that because I didn't get it, other folks may not get it," Mark Valentine recalls. The family put out a statement in support of vaccination, and Mark went on to his brother's talk show to encourage listeners to take the shot.He also headed to his local Walmart to get vaccinated. "The guy comes out; he said, 'Do you have any questions or concerns?' " Mark Valentine recalls. "I said, 'Hell yeah, I've got both, but do it anyway.' "MethodologyVaccination rate data are the rate of vaccination among all people 18 years of age or older, as of Nov. 30. They are from theCenters for Disease Control and Prevention.COVID-19 deaths per 100,000 residents are calculated by dividing the deaths from COVID-19 in a county since May 1 by the county's population. County population data come from theU.S. Census Bureau's 2020 decennial census. May 1 was chosen as the start date of our analysis because that is roughly the time when vaccines became universally available to adults ages 18 and older. COVID-19 death data is collected by theCenter for Systems Science and Engineering(CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University and is current as of Nov. 30. COVID-19 death data for Florida and Utah are from the May 2 and December 1 editions of theCOVID-19 Community Profile Report,produced by the White House COVID-19 Team.2020 election result data are fromMIT Election Data and Science Lab.Alaska does not report election results by county-equivalent area, so it is excluded from the analysis. Nebraska is excluded from the analysis because it does not report county-level COVID-19 statistics. Hawaii is excluded because it does not report county-level vaccine data. Some counties that have reported no COVID-19 deaths since May 1 may have stopped reporting. These counties generally have very small populations and have a negligible impact on the weighted averages. Erring on the side of caution, we include all data unless it is known that they are in error.All averages are weighted by county population. The overall average represents the average of the 3,011 counties included in the analysis.Thanks to Emily Gurley, Professor of the Practice and Emily Pond, Research Data Analyst, both of Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health for discussions about our methodology.NPR's Huo Jingnan contributed to this story.This story has been updated to clarify the relationship of political partisanship to vaccination status.Additionally, Florida's counties were removed from the analysis after publication because we learned that Florida has not updated county-level death numbers since June 3.

The little bumps are spike proteins (see definition below).Uma Shankar Sharma/Getty Imageshide captionA 3D-generated image of the coronavirus variant of concern known as omicron. The little bumps are spike proteins (see definition below).Each week, we answer frequently asked questions about life during the coronavirus crisis. If you have a question you'd like us to consider for a future post, email us atgoatsandsoda@npr.orgwith the subject line: "Weekly Coronavirus Questions." See an archive of our FAQshere.When I'm reading about the new omicron variant, I feel like I need a medical degree. What does "immune evasion" mean, exactly? Virus neutralization assay?! Help!We get it: COVID-19 news happens fast, and those of us without a medical degree can feel a little lost. So we turned to three COVID-wise experts —Dr. Jill Weatherhead, assistant professor of adult and pediatric infectious diseases at Baylor College of Medicine;Dr. Greg Poland, professor of medicine and infectious diseases at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn.; andMatthew Binnicker, Ph.D., vice chair of practice in the Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology at the Mayo Clinic — to help us translate some of the terms you're likely to run across.So let's start with a quote from Weatherhead:"The omicron variant has over 50 genetic mutations in the viral genome. Many of these mutations are found in the spike protein region," Weatherhead says. "Some of the individual mutations suggest that the omicron variant may be more transmissible or evade immune responses. Despite the association of these mutations with transmissibility and immune evasion, the clinical impact of omicron remains unknown because of the phenomenon of epistasis."If you didn't quite catch all of that, here's a guide to help.Mutation:A mutation is a change in a virus's genetic code. Mutations are a normal part of viral replication. Viruses make copies of themselves as they spread within a human. Mutations happen when a mistake is made during copying. In rare instances, mutations change the behavior of the virus. Most of the time, they don't.Variant:In essence, a variant is a version of the virus with a slightly different genetic sequence because of the appearance of mutations. Many mutations quickly disappear as the virus spreads. But sometimes, mutations stick around and get passed down to future generations of the virus. Over time, the virus can accumulate a unique set of mutations that make it distinct from other versions of the virus. These distinct versions are called variants.Variant of concern (VOC):The World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention monitor variants and alert the public to variants of concern that could pose added risk because of "increased transmissibility, increased severity of disease or decreased effectiveness of public health interventions [diagnostic tests, preventive measures like vaccines or therapeutic measures like monoclonal antibodies]," Weatherhead explains.Transmissibility:The ability of a virus to spread from infected people to others. The delta variant is more transmissible than previous variants because of mutations on its spike protein, which make it better at attaching to and infecting cells. There is concern that omicron could be even more transmissible than the highly transmissible delta variant, but we don't know yet whether that is the case.Immune evasion:After an infection or a vaccine, your body produces antibodies that can detect and kill the virus upon a subsequent exposure. Sometimes a virus can mutate in a way that helps it evade or escape detection by those antibodies. That's what scientists call "immune evasion." There'spreliminary evidencethat omicron could be much better at immune evasion than the delta variant or any other variant before it because of the specific mutations on its spike protein.Outcompete:In sports, if you outcompete other athletes by getting to the finish line first or scoring more points, you're No. 1. In the world of viruses, winning is more akin to the reality showSurvivor; viruses can evolve to infect more people — or to infect them faster — than previous variants and become No. 1. "It's basically survival of the fittest," Binnicker explains. "Delta showed us it was king of the hill. We'll have to see over the next two to four weeks if omicron is better at transmitting than delta." If it is, it will likely push delta out of many regions of the world and could become the dominate variant.Epistasis:The Greek roots of this word mean "standing upon." So what does that have to do with viruses? Well, in genetics, the term describes how mutations depend on each other. The way an individual mutation makes a virus behave often depends on what other mutations are present. That's why scientists can't look at a single mutation and know exactly how it will change a virus — mutations need to be assessed together. Think of it as cheerleaders standing on each other: Any movement by one of them often affects the entire formation.Virus neutralization assay (VNA):OK, let's take this apart. An assay is a test. Neutralization is a term familiar to those who love science fiction. If you neutralize an attack from an alien ship, you've won! In the world of viruses, we want to know if antibodies can stop — or neutralize — a virus particle. And the way to find out is a VNA: a lab test that measures the capability and magnitude of a human's antibodies to stop infection. This test can be used to determine how well one part of the immune system is working to prevent or clear an infection. Scientists can use it to estimate how well a vaccine may work.Hybrid immunity:Scientists say a person has "hybrid immunity" if the person was infected with SARS-CoV-2 and then, at least six months later, received a COVID-19 vaccine. This scenario triggers high levels of antibodies and strong protection against variants. Some scientists have called it "super-immunity."Spike protein:You've probably seen more than enough pictures of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The spike protein creates the bumps on the virus particle. It's a critical region of the virus for several reasons. Spike proteins bind to human cells and help the virus gain entry inside cells. And these spike proteins are the target of many critical antibodies. A major way the immune system detects the virus is by its spike proteins.Preventive measures:OK, this isn't a hard one to figure out. And for now, the fact remains that not enough is known to take much action to forestall infections besides getting vaccinated and boosted and following the prevention strategies of masking and physical distancing that we've relied on throughout the coronavirus pandemic.Sheila Mulrooney Eldred is a freelance health journalist in Minneapolis.

Julie McCarthyHealth workers prepare COVID-19 vaccines at a coliseum in suburban Manila on November 29 — part of a massive 3-day vaccination drive launched by the government. It was one of 8,000 vaccination centers set up during the drive.Ted Aljibe/AFP via Getty Imageshide captionHealth workers prepare COVID-19 vaccines at a coliseum in suburban Manila on November 29 — part of a massive 3-day vaccination drive launched by the government. It was one of 8,000 vaccination centers set up during the drive.The Philippine government, beset by charges of incompetence and corruption in its handling of the pandemic, has mounted a vaccination campaign that any of its Southeast Asian neighbors might envy. Over the course of just three days this week the country vaccinated 7.6 million people ages 12 and above.34.53% of the country is now fully vaccinated.Conky Quizon, field epidemiologist and member of the National Immunization Technical Advisory Group, called it "a big, big deal" and put the unprecedented numbers down to easy access to the vaccines — there were 8,000 centers set up across the Philippines — and several different vaccines on offer, including Pfizer, Moderna and China's Sinovax.There was also the bandwagon effect. "I think it's something cultural in the Philippines," Qiozon says. When you see so many people participating, she says, "you think it must be good, it must be safe, it must be efficacious if so many people are queuing. So I think that made a difference."The thought of his workplace imposing a mandatory vaccination convinced Elmer Balanoyos, 33, a driver for a towing company, to get his shot. He says he was hesitant about vaccines, then discovered that no one he knew who'd been previously inoculated had experienced any bad side effects. Balanoyos is also worried about the much-mutated omicron variant, which has not yet emerged in the Philippines. "One of the reasons why I came here is because of the new variant," he says.Crowds turned out to receive vaccines at an upscale shopping mall in metro Manila. Because the mall draws large numbers of holiday shoppers, it was considered a strategic choice for a vaccine site.Ella Mage/NPRhide captionCrowds turned out to receive vaccines at an upscale shopping mall in metro Manila. Because the mall draws large numbers of holiday shoppers, it was considered a strategic choice for a vaccine site."Here" is the upscale Glorietta Shopping Mall in the commercial district of Makati city in Metro Manila, which usually teems this time of year with yuletide shoppers in Christmas-revelry in Catholic-majority Philippines. One of the cavernous halls in the complex doubled this week as an immunization site.Jocelyn Gorzon, 48, joined the throngs waiting for a jab, overcoming her fear of needles. She works as a domestic for a family in a wealthy enclave nearby, and her employer told her she needed to get vaccinated. "Everybody in the house [is] except me," she says, adding, "It's good for all of us."Dante Caburnay, 26, was auditing a store in the mall and dropped in to get vaccinated. He says he would never have considered a vaccine were it not for the fact he soon plans to propose marriage on the resort island of Boracay, where a vaccination is required. With Christmas music wafting in the background he says, "So I'm left with no choice."It's no coincidence the country's most ambitious vaccine effort to date coincided with the run-up to the holidays. Philippine families traditionally assemble for large multi-generational gatherings, and health officials have said the vaccine campaign is intended to provide Filipinos greater protection during this busy social season.The government is also interested in promoting economic activity. Christmas is normally a time of strong retail sales ignited by employee bonuses and remittances from Filipinos working overseas. Relaxed lockdowns are already pulling more people into the malls but strapped Filipinos reeling from the pandemic-induced downturn may be unable or unwilling to spend.Quizon says the harsh financial realities of a severe COVID-19 case are also persuading people to get immunized. She says it's not unusual for critically ill patients to wind up with hospital bills totaling 2 million pesos, or $40,000. Even after government insurance pays out, she says patients are left owing as much as $24,000 in out-of-pocket expenses.Quizon says ordinary Filipinos are beginning to realize they had "better get themselves vaccinated because you really cannot afford to be sick."Fortunately, the government's vaccination effort has developed a momentum of its own. Organizers, who had hoped to vaccinate 9-million people in three days, have encouraged municipalities to leave the sites open to take advantage of the high public interest.A scene from the Glorietta Shopping Mall vaccination effort. Even after its successful vaccination drive the country has inoculated just over a third of its 110-million people. By contrast, Vietnam has immunized 55% of its population, and Cambodia has fully vaccinated 81%.Ella Mage/NPRhide captionA scene from the Glorietta Shopping Mall vaccination effort. Even after its successful vaccination drive the country has inoculated just over a third of its 110-million people. By contrast, Vietnam has immunized 55% of its population, and Cambodia has fully vaccinated 81%.News of the week's impressive turn-out was a welcome respite for pandemic-weary Filipinos. They've lost more than 48,000 people in one of the region's worst COVID-19 outbreaks. Their economy has been decimated in nearly two years of off-again-on-again lockdowns. And the country has been judged a laggard in the region, rolling out vaccines slower than many of its neighbors. Even after its successful vaccination drive the country has inoculated just over a third of its 110-million people. By contrast, Vietnam has immunized 55% of its population, and Cambodia has fully vaccinated 81%.As vaccinations have risen, new daily infections in the Philippines have also dramatically dropped. The number of new cases in the past week is 4,300 compared to 146,000 the week of September 5-11, the record high.University of the Philippines professor and pandemic analyst Guido David says, "Last year, the country plateaued at around 2,000 cases a day, and now we're way below that. And the vaccines seem to be helping." He says the estimated 2.5% positivity rate compared to the 24% rate during the September surge "does confirm that the number of cases have decreased significantly." The country's largest COVID-19 referral medical facility, the Philippine General Hospital in Manila, reports thatno new COVID patients have been admitted in the last 2 days.However, the number of deaths the past week—807 – is unusually high considering the low number of new cases.There's another theory for the drop in cases. David submits that perhaps "40 to 50% of the entire population" may have already been exposed to COVID-19 but not all of them have been counted in the country's tallies. David says because "there is no incentive" for the Philippine masses who struggle financially to spend money on expensive testing, many cases of the virus are not recorded. And if that's the case, he says the virus has been circulating naturally, and by default, providing broad immunization.David says with the latest vaccination push the country may have turned a corner.But President Duterte sees no reason to relax as the omicron variant gains ground globally. With characteristic bluntness he urged people to get vaccinated. This week he told his countrymen to choose: "Early demise or live longer?"Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Elissa NadwornyA nurse administers a dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine during a City of Long Beach Public Health mobile vaccination clinic at the California State University, Long Beach campus.Patrick T. Fallon/AFP via Getty Imageshide captionA nurse administers a dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine during a City of Long Beach Public Health mobile vaccination clinic at the California State University, Long Beach campus.This week, Wesleyan University in Connecticut held its first booster vaccine clinic on campus. CJ Joseph, a first-year student still figuring out what to major in, wasted no time signing up."I was like, 'Heck, yes, I will be the first person to get it' " says Joseph, who was one of the first students to get the shot atWednesday's clinic at Beckham Hall.Convenience was a major selling point. "I have a lot of work to do," Joseph explains. "Being able to walk like a good four minutes just to get my COVID vaccine made it so much easier for me and I didn't have to spend money to get an Uber to go over to Walgreens or to CVS."The liberal arts campus, which serves about3,000 students, will require COVID-19 booster shots for those on campus this spring. It is one of the first colleges to do so."There's no good reason to hesitate," says Michael Roth, the president of Wesleyan University. "Some people don't like to be first. But in this case, being first for public health doesn't seem to be a particularly risky place to be."More than 1,000 colleges across the country required COVID-19 vaccines for students and staff this year, according to data from theChronicle of Higher Education.With theCDC recommendationthat all adults get booster shots, colleges now must weigh how to incorporate the additional dose into their pandemic response plans.For now, many schools are simply encouraging students and staff to get the extra dose. Among them areDuke University, an early adopter of a campus vaccine mandate last spring. Rutgers,largely cited as the first U.S. university to require COVID-19 vaccinations, issued a statement saying "we have no impending plans to require boosters for any community member." But administrators are encouraging "everyone to take advantage of booster shots as a way of increasing their personal protection against the virus."At Wesleyan, Roth says there were some colleagues who questioned making it a requirement, insisting that compliance would be high anyway among a student population that was already nearly all vaccinated.He says requiring the booster makes it a social norm rather than an individual decision. "The majority of our people would have gotten the booster without the encouragement," he says, "but we want to get the rate up as high as possible."He points to other vaccine requirements on the college campus, like meningitis and measles, mumps and rubella, noting that much of the ambivalence he sees comes from the politicization of the COVID-19 vaccine. "It just seemed like our obligation," he says.Joseph, who is at high risk due to asthma, is grateful for that clear message."I really appreciate the fact that it is required that we get our booster shots," Joseph says, "because I feel like there are people who kind of view next step shots as a 'Oh, whatever. I don't really have to get it.' "The mandate, Joseph says, plus the ease of access, makes the campus feel safer.About an hour after Joseph got the booster, Hallie Sternberg, a junior studying history and French, waited in line to get hers. She saw friends in line; she caught up with them to talk about Thanksgiving break and the upcoming needle they were bracing for."People are excited and ready to have it over with," she said after she'd gotten the shot. "Everyone's like, 'I'm just going to manifest that I will not be sick [with side effects] because we don't have time. We have finals.' I have presentations next week and papers to do the week after that, so I'm just trying to get it out of the way."One question that colleges and universities still need to answer is, will the CDC update the definition of what "fully vaccinated" means, given that boosters are now encouraged for all adults?  "Fully vaccinated, that term is extremely important to determine what that means for the community," explains Gerri Taylor, co-chair of the American College Health Association's COVID-19 task force. "If, in fact, the CDC says that fully vaccinated means having a booster within six months of getting your vaccine, as an example, then the colleges may put that into their requirements."Her organization will issue guidance to colleges once that happens, but in the meantime, she recommends that colleges set up booster clinics on campus and encourage their communities to get an extra shot."Colleges are well prepared to do boosters," she says. They "have a captive population, and the stakes are there: We want students to be back in school and we've heard that over and over from the American Academy of Pediatrics and from students."She points to two complicating factors: staffing and timing. Arecent survey by the American College Health Associationfound the top two concerns for college health centers were staffing and burnout, because of the intensity and the duration of the pandemic.When it comes to timing, there's not much left of the fall semester before finals and winter break. "Timing is so critical and has been throughout this pandemic," says Taylor. "So, do you start a booster clinic now? Or do you do it in January or February when students return for this spring semester?"Those, she says, are decisions colleges are making right now.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Joe PalcaScientists at Pfizer's research and development laboratories in Groton, Conn., worked on the COVID-19 pill called Paxlovid.Stew Milne/APhide captionScientists at Pfizer's research and development laboratories in Groton, Conn., worked on the COVID-19 pill called Paxlovid.Two new drugs are awaiting authorization from the Food and Drug Administration for treating patients with COVID-19, and both may be effective against the omicron variant.One is made by Merck, the other by Pfizer.TheMerck drughas been in development for years. When the pandemic began, Pfizer's drug didn't exist. The story of its development is another example of how COVID-19 has sped up the drug and vaccine development process.Pfizer wasn't starting exactly from zero.Mikael Dolsten, Pfizer's chief scientific officer, says that during the SARS outbreak in 2003, company scientists had begun to search for ways to combat that coronavirus.In particular, they looked for proteins crucial for the virus to replicate once it infected someone.One viral protein they focused on is called a protease. "We have learned that protease is a key regulator for the virus to unleash its machinery and hijack the human cells," Dolsten says.Pfizer scientists thought if they could find a compound that would disrupt the protease, it would essentially stop the virus dead in its tracks.That search petered out when the 2003 SARS outbreak passed. No disease, no market for a drug.But Dolsten says the knowledge that was gained convinced them that a protease inhibitor would work to corral the coronavirus causing COVID-19.They made computer models of the viral protease protein and assembled drug candidates that might block it."We actually had to design and synthesize some 600 unique chemical compounds," he says.That was just the start. They had to test each compound to see how well it prevented the virus from infecting cells in the lab. Then they had to determine whether it would do the same thing in animals infected with the coronavirus. They also needed to find a candidate that would remain in someone's body long enough to have the desired antiviral effect. And they wanted to do all this fast."We put in place some very aggressive timelines where we made all of this happen over four months to come down to the optimal medicine," Dolsten says.In the end, the drug developers had a candidate they thought would work. They mixed it in a pill with an old drug called ritonavir that extended the action of the protease inhibitor.This past July, Pfizer began a study of people infected with the coronavirus who were at high risk of developing severe COVID-19. Half got the drug, called Paxlovid, within three to five days of the onset of symptoms, half a placebo.Dolsten says the study was halted early because thedrug appeared to be working. He says there was nearly a 90% reduction in hospitalization among people taking the new drug, "And 100% protection against death."A similar analysis for the Merck drug found it lowered the risk of hospitalization or death by 50%. In asubsequent analysis presented to the FDA, the risk reduction fell to 30%, however.One good thing about these drugs is that because they're pills, they can be taken at home, unlike some current therapies that require an infusion.Because Pfizer's pill isn't affected by changes in the spike protein, Dolsten says he expects the new drug will work equally well against any variant of the coronavirus, including omicron.Although Pfizer has not yet published details of its study, researchers seem impressed."I think this drug along with the drug from Merck are both very promising antivirals that, as we had predicted early in this pandemic, work when given early in the infectious course," saysStanley Perlman, a microbiologist at the University of Iowa, where he's been working on coronaviruses for decades.Perlman adds that the key to preventing damage from a coronavirus infection is to stop it from replicating and spreading throughout someone's body.Protease isn't the only viral protein that might lead to a viable treatment."I think there's several other targets in how the virus reproduces," Perlman says. "But the most important thing to think about for all of them is they almost all have to be given very early after infection to really have a role in helping prevent people from progressing to more severe disease."And since it looks like we'll be living with COVID-19 for a while, drugmakers have an incentive to develop other kinds of drugs to treat the disease.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Michaeleen DoucleffA registered nurse administers the COVID-19 vaccine at a high school gym in Corona, California. Scientists are trying to determine if vaccines (and boosters) will offer protection against the newly identified omicron variant.Frederic J. Brown /AFP via Getty Imageshide captionA registered nurse administers the COVID-19 vaccine at a high school gym in Corona, California. Scientists are trying to determine if vaccines (and boosters) will offer protection against the newly identified omicron variant.Researchers in Botswana and South Africa just detected the omicron variant a few weeks ago, but already many scientists are predicting that the efficacy of the vaccines will likely take a hit, probably a big hit, when it comes to stopping infections of omicron. And more breakthrough infections will likely occur if (and that's a big if) omicron spreads here in the U.S.At the same time, there's hope that vaccines will still offer good protection against severe disease and hospitalization, especially with a third dose.What's the reason for the strong current of pessimism?The answer lies in a study published back in September which, in many ways, predicted the emergence of a variant like omicron — that is, a variant with an exceptionally large number of mutations. The study also offers critical insights about how well vaccines will work against omicron.In the study,publishedinNature, the scientists were trying to understand how SARS-CoV-2 learns to outsmart people's antibodies — the body's key defense against viral infections.Paul Bieniasz and his colleagues wondered if SARS-CoV-2 could evolve in a way to completely knock out antibodies' ability to detect and kill the virus. "The goal was to answer the question: Is it possible for SARS-CoV-2 to completely evade neutralizing antibodies?" Bieniasz says.So he and his team intentionally engineered a supermutant version of the virus — though not the full virus, just a piece of it. Specifically, they focused on the infamous spike portion of the virus, which binds to human cells and is the target of important antibodies. Bieniasz tried to make this spike completely impervious to antibodies.In essence, they took about 20 mutations and put them all together onto one spike protein, which they call a "polymutant spike mutant." These mutations had already cropped up in several variants around the globe but never all together."They are the mutations that individually occur naturally and we combined them," Bieniasz says. And they had been shown to help the virus evade detection by antibodies.Interestingly, Bieniasza says, the omicron variant has many of the same mutations as this polymutant spike protein. But it has even more mutations, he says. Instead of just 20 mutations on the spike protein, omicron has about 30. "Omicron appears to have certain combinations of mutations that together would confer more pervasive resistance to individual classes of antibodies," he says.Bieniasz and his team then took antibodies from people who have had two doses of an mRNA vaccine or had a prior COVID infection. They tested these antibodies against the polymutant spike protein. They looked to see if those antibodies could have any ability whatsoever to even partly neutralize it. For all practical purposes, they couldn't."This polymutant spike protein was almost completely resistant to the neutralizing antibodies in those two sets of plasmas," Bieniasz says."Based on those findings, we expect that omicron will be significantly resistant to antibodies that are circulating in individuals who have convalescence or who have had mRNA vaccines," Bieniasz says. "The magnitude of that loss of sensitivity to those antibodies obviously has to be experimentally determined."Scientists all over the world, including those working for vaccine manufacturers, are rushing to figure out what that magnitude will be. For instance, researchers at Pfizer are taking antibodies from people who have had two or three shots of the vaccine and seeing if those antibodies have any neutralization capabilities against omicron."We remain cautiously optimistic that after three doses, you will have some meaningful protection," saysDr. Mikael Dolsten, who's the chief scientific adviser for Pfizer.The hope is that protection against severe disease and hospitalization will hold up, says virologistJeremy Lubanat UMass Chan Medical School. Antibodies are the primary tool your body uses to stop an initial SARS-CoV-2 infection. But even if the effectiveness of your antibodies goes down 10- or 20-fold, "that might still be enough to keep you from going to the hospital," Luban says.In addition, there are other components of the immune system, such as T cells, which can clear out an infection quickly if one does occur — and thus, help to protect you from serious illness. In general T cells are much less likely to lose effectiveness when the virus mutates than antibodies are. For example, Dr.Antonio Bertolettiand his team at Duke-NUS Medical School havepreliminary datashowing that T cell activity remains quite high even against a polymutant spike protein similar to the one created by Bieniasz and colleagues. "Conclusion: the picture does not look so terrible for T cells," members of the Bertoletti lab wrote on Twitter.Finally, there's even more hope that a third shot of an mRNA vaccine — a so-called booster — will work better than two shots, says virologistPei-Yong Shiat University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, who works with Pfizer. First off, he says, the third dose doesn't just return your antibody levels to what they were after the second shot. The level is even higher.On top of that, the booster can actually help broaden out your defenses so that you can fight off not just one variant of SARS-CoV-2 but many different versions of it. "The booster increases the level of antibodies that can push back against the variants," Shi says. "So that's another advantage to the booster."In other words, that extra exposure could help the body stay one step ahead of the virus — and even perhaps teach the immune system how to fight off additional variants that could arise in the future.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Selena Simmons-DuffinDr. Matifadza Hlatshwayo Davis, who directs the St. Louis Department of Health, has turned to social media platforms this week and to local clergy and community groups — the sort of trusted messengers people turn to in times of uncertainty — to help get the right sort of early word out about the omicron variant. Conveying what's known and what's still to be learned are both important, she says.Brian Munoz/St. Louis Public Radiohide captionDr. Matifadza Hlatshwayo Davis, who directs the St. Louis Department of Health, has turned to social media platforms this week and to local clergy and community groups — the sort of trusted messengers people turn to in times of uncertainty — to help get the right sort of early word out about the omicron variant. Conveying what's known and what's still to be learned are both important, she says.With thefirst case of omicron confirmed in Californiaand more cases expected across the U.S., public health officials who know the difference between good and bad crisis communication say they can't afford to be quiet and waituntil scientists know how riskythe new variant is before they speak out."We don't want to just be silent on the matter, because then that can cause fear and then that can allow for misinformation to creep in," saysElya Franciscus, the epidemiology operations manager for COVID-19 in Harris County, Texas.There's amantra in crisis communication: Be first, be right, be credible. "One of those is clearly being first," saysCrystal Watson, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. "So even though we don't know a whole lot right now, I think it's important to hear from public health officials." That said, being credible also meansnotgiving information you may have to retract as more is learned. Walking that line can be very tricky, as U.S. health officials learned at the start of the pandemic when theyunderestimated the usefulness of masksin protecting against infection."Sometimes these messages can be very definitive and not convey what the uncertainty is," says Watson. The danger of being too definitive is that you can be accused of flip-flopping later if new information necessitates new guidance.This time, a lot of local public health departments around the country are working hard to get the message right, saysAdriane Casalottiof the National Association of County and City Health Officials. "We have seen local health departments being out there, trying to explain to folks what we do know, but also what we don't know — and what the timeframe is, and what the process is for learning more."One official who's getting out there isDr. Matifadza Hlatshwayo Davis, a specialist in infectious diseases and the director of health for the city of St. Louis."The message is: There's no need to panic," she says. "We still need to learn, we still need to wait for science to do its thing. But in the meantime, we have tools available to keep ourselves and our community safe. We have safe and effective vaccines — so go out and get one — we know that masking works, we know that social distancing works, and we know that hand-washing works."In addition to the "don't panic, do this instead" message,Vish Viswanath, professor of health communication at Harvard's T.H. Chan School of Public Health says Hlatshwayo Davis is also signaling to the community that she's engaged and plans to keep them updated as scientists learn more about the new variant. He says her approach is "exactly what we need.""That sense of competence and action — 'we are watching it, we are on top of it, we'll work with you' — it won't eliminate, but it will abate many concerns," he says.Watson notes that the public health measures officials have already been recommending to protect against delta and any SARS-CoV-2 variant — to get vaccinated and boosted, wear masks indoors in public spaces, socially distance and wash your hands — "are still a good idea and are still going to be effective against this variant. We don't know how that effectiveness will change, but we know that these are still tried and true things that have worked for other variants."It's also key to encourage people to stay tuned as more is learned, Viswanath says, with messages like this: " 'Here are the guidelines that have always worked, please take these actions, they will continue to work. If we find out that they don't work and there have to be changes, we will tell you.'"Communicating that sense of transparency is very important," he says.For Hlatshwayo Davis, howand when she conveys these messages is also important. She's done COVID-19 town halls in the past, taking audience questions, and she likes that format."But I want to be careful about timing. I think it's very frustrating to convene people to tell them. 'We don't know. We don't know. We don't know. We don't know.' Right?" she says. So her focus right now is using social media platforms and connecting with local clergy and community groups — the sort of trusted messengers people turn to in times of uncertainty.We still have a lot to learn about#Omicron. No need to panic, we have the tools to stay safe:✔️Get your vaccine, or booster if eligible✔️Wear a mask correctly especially indoors✔️Stay 6 feet apart in crowded spaces✔️Wash your hands often✔️Advocate for global vaccine equityWhen there's more information about omicron to dig into, then her department will "have a town hall where we can have some really good dialogue," Davis says, adding "I'm hoping that will be able to be accomplished within the next two to three weeks."Vishwanath notes that public health officials are addressing a mixed audience. Not everyone is feeling panicked by the news of omicron. A lot of people are indifferent — or actively resistant — to the idea that there's a new variant of concern. And that can make communication harder. "It's a difficult thing because people are tired, people are fatigued and you have to understand where they're coming from," he says.Of course, a lot of health department staffers have their own pandemic fatigue. And getting the right message out is only one part of their mission. They also need to be ready to identify and track future omicron cases, while dealing with the current load of delta cases."We haven't really slowed down — we've never stopped testing, we've never stopped vaccinating," says Franciscus in Harris County. "So it's easy for us to kind of switch from, 'Oh, maybe it looked like we were hitting a low point and we could maybe start slowing down' to, 'OK, new variant — let's ramp up again.' "She says her county health department has a plan ready if and when omicron is identified locally.Hlatshwayo Davis in St. Louis says the public health toolkit is a lot more robust than it was when the pandemic began."Are we really at the same place with this new variant as we were in March to 2020? The answer is no," she says."We have rapid tests available, we have done contact tracing for two years — we know what works and doesn't work. We have safe and effective vaccines, the ability to provide them now for children above the age of 5. This puts us leaps and bounds [beyond] where we were," she says.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Tamara KeithBrian NaylorPresident Joe Biden speaks about new steps to combat COVID-19 surges this winter during a visit to the National Institutes of Health on Dec. 2, 2021, in Bethesda, Md.Evan Vucci/APhide captionPresident Joe Biden speaks about new steps to combat COVID-19 surges this winter during a visit to the National Institutes of Health on Dec. 2, 2021, in Bethesda, Md.President Biden announced Thursday that private health insurance plans will soon reimburse people who buy over-the-counter, at-home rapid tests for the coronavirus — one of a series of steps the White House is planning in order to encourage better detection and prevention of COVID-19 this winter.Speaking at the National Institutes of Health, Biden said the measures do not include shutdowns or lockdowns, and instead focus on "widespread vaccinations and boosters and testing.""The actions that I'm announcing are ones that all Americans can rally behind," Biden said. His last major set of COVID announcements included a series of vaccination mandates, which have sparked lawsuits and political opposition from Republicans.There was no single blockbuster announcement and no major new mandate or target for rapidly increasing the number of vaccinated Americans. Instead, Biden's plan to fight the coronavirus this winter is a battle of increments: efforts to get booster shots into the arms of all adults and especially seniors, setting up family vaccine clinics, offering more free and lower-cost at-home testing options, stockpiling antiviral pills and readying strike teams to help states with outbreaks.He outlined the new steps on the day after thefirst U.S. case of the omicron variant was discovered, in California. A second case was revealed Thursdayin Minnesota and a third in Colorado. Officials are concerned that the variant could spread more easily than previous strains.In an interview with NPR, Natalie Quillian, the deputy White House COVID-19 response coordinator, described the plan this way: "The bottom line is we are really pulling out all the stops to get Americans the maximum protection as we head into the winter months and as we face this new [omicron] variant."Biden citeda surveythat showed that 30% of people who said they were not vaccinated will now consider getting vaccinated because of concerns abut the omincron variant. "I hope that's true," Biden said.Biden called it "a sad, sad commentary" that COVID-19 has become a political issue and expressed hope that as the nation moves into the winter and faces the challenges of a new variant, "this is a moment where we can put the divisiveness behind us."Biden also noted that the nation is "in a position of strength" this winter compared to last year, with most schools open, and most people having been vaccinated.One of the new elements will be requiring private health insurers to reimburse people who buy at-home tests — just as insurers are currently required to cover tests done at pharmacies and labs. This will reduce costs for more than 150 million Americans with private insurance, once the official rule is finalized and put in place in the new year."We think this is the right policy," Quillian told NPR. "We also think it's the most economical policy, because the cost of an individual getting COVID and going to the hospital and seeking those bills is much higher than the cost of any rapid home test."For people without private insurance, the government will buy another 25 million tests to give to community health centers and rural clinics. In September, the White House spurred manufacturing of at-home tests with $3 billion in spending, which included 25 million tests for underserved communities."Our supply of these rapid tests has quadrupled this month from where we were at the end of summer," Quillian said. "We've put a ton of resources into this."At-home coronavirus tests made by Abbott and Quidel are on sale Nov. 15 at a CVS store in Lakewood, Wash., south of Seattle.Ted S. Warren/APhide captionAt-home coronavirus tests made by Abbott and Quidel are on sale Nov. 15 at a CVS store in Lakewood, Wash., south of Seattle.The administration also will require that all travelers coming into the United States be tested for the coronavirus a day before departure for their tripusing a viral test. This will apply to Americans returning home, whether they're vaccinated or unvaccinated, as well as to foreign travelers.But there are no new requirements for testing after arrival in the U.S. or for quarantining after returning from a trip.The administration will extend the requirement to wear masks on planes and public transportation to March 18.The White House also wants to try to increase the number of people getting booster shots. In total, 100 million adults have yet to get a booster shot.So far, only half of U.S. seniors have received a booster shot, something that the administration has emphasized will help protect them against the new variant. The shots have been available to seniors since September.If you got your COVID-19 vaccine before June, now is the time to get a booster shot. All adults are eligible for the booster—just go tohttps://t.co/k4jKpPT5qoto find a vaccine and booster location near you.pic.twitter.com/wx4e4cshC2The administration will work with pharmacies and the AARP on outreach campaigns to encourage people to make appointments, and will offer clinics on evenings and weekends. The government will also launch family vaccination days so that adults can get their booster shots while getting their kids vaccinated."I think for working families, for busy moms and dads, this is a really hopefully convenient way where they can go get their booster and their kids' shots all at the same time," Quillian said.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is also getting ready to release information on "test to stay" policies that let kids exposed to COVID stay in school as long as they repeatedly test negative for the virus, rather than recommending mandatory 14-day quarantines.Seven-year-old Rihanna Chihuaque receives a COVID-19 vaccine in Chicago in this file photo from Nov. 12.Scott Olson/Getty Imageshide captionSeven-year-old Rihanna Chihuaque receives a COVID-19 vaccine in Chicago in this file photo from Nov. 12.An earlier version of this story said travelers will need to test within 24 hours of leaving for a trip into the United States.

"The family asks that their privacy be respected as they grieve this difficult loss. Please continue to lift them up in prayer."Lamb's relatives have spoken over the past month about his battle with the virus. His wife, Joni, said he had diabetes and was hospitalized after his oxygen levels dropped.Lamb and Daystar — based in Bedford, Texas, in the Dallas-Fort Worth area — have promoted views opposing COVID-19 vaccines and restrictions to stop the spread of the disease. The network's programs have featured vaccine skeptics and health care professionals who promote alternative COVID-19 treatments.It's unclear whether Lamb received a COVID-19 vaccine.In recent months, a number of prominent anti-vaccination Christian broadcasters have died from COVID-19. Radio hosts Dick Farrell, Phil Valentine and Marc Bernier, who were unvaccinated, all died after they contracted the virus.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Shannon BondMeta has removed six networks of accounts for abusing its platforms, underscoring the ways bad actors around the world use social media as a tool to promote false information and harass opponents.Kirill Kudryavtsev/AFP via Getty Imageshide captionMeta has removed six networks of accounts for abusing its platforms, underscoring the ways bad actors around the world use social media as a tool to promote false information and harass opponents.The parent company of Facebook and Instagram said on Wednesday it has taken down more than 600 accounts, pages and groups connected to a Chinese influence operation spreading COVID-19 disinformation, including an account purporting to be a fictitious Swiss biologist.The China-based network was one of sixMeta, formerly know as Facebook, removed in November for abusing its platforms, a reminder that bad actors around the world are using social media to promote false information and harass opponents.The other operations included one supporting Hamas and two others, based in Poland and Belarus, that were focused on themigration crisison the countries' shared border.Meta also removed a network tied to a European anti-vaccination conspiracy movement that harassed doctors, elected officials and journalists on Facebook and other internet platforms, as well as a group of accounts in Vietnam that reported activists and government critics to Facebook in attempts to get them banned from the social network.The China-based operation came to light after the company was alerted to an account purporting to be a Swiss biologist named Wilson Edwards (no such person exists). The account posted claims on Facebook and Twitter in July that the U.S. was pressuring World Health Organization scientists to blame China for the COVID-19 virus. The posts alleging U.S. intimidation soon appeared in Chinese state media stories."This campaign was a hall of mirrors, endlessly reflecting a single fake persona," Ben Nimmo, who investigates influence operations at Meta, wrote in the company'sreport. Meta connected the operation to individuals in China and people "associated with Chinese state infrastructure companies located around the world," he said.The Chinese operation was an example of what Meta calls "coordinated inauthentic behavior," in which adversaries usefake accountsfor influence operations, as Russian operatives did by impersonating Americans on Facebook in the run-up to the 2016 U.S. presidential election.But recently, Meta's security team has expanded its focus to root out accounts ofreal peoplewho are working together to cause harm both on Facebook and offline.That was the rationale used to remove a network of accounts in Italy and France connected to an anti-vaccination movement known as V_V. According to areportfrom the research firm Graphika, the group largely coordinates on the messaging app Telegram, but "appears to primarily target Facebook, where its members display the group's double V symbol in their profile pictures and swarm the comments sections of posts advocating for COVID-19 vaccines with hundreds of abusive messages." Graphika said the group has also defaced health facilities and attempted to disrupt public vaccination programs.Meta said the people behind the network used real, duplicate and fake accounts to comment on Facebook posts in droves and intimidate people. That breaks the company's rules against "brigading." Meta said it is not banning all V_V content but will take further action if it finds more rule-breaking behavior. It did not say how many accounts it removed in the network.The company acknowledged that even as it becomes quicker at detecting and removing accounts that break its rules, it is playing a cat-and-mouse game."Adversarial networks don't strive to neatly fit our policies or only violate one at a time," Nathaniel Gleicher, Meta's head of security policy, wrote in ablog poston Wednesday. "We build our defenses with the expectation that they will not stop, but rather adapt and try new tactics. "Editor's note:Meta pays NPR to license NPR content.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

Not lockdown, but things like masking, hand hygiene, distancing, improving ventilation, etc.""And in that context, if you have any of those types of factors in a virus is circulating, it will take advantage of that," she said.Van Kerkhove praised South Africa for its transparency and its willingness "to not only share data, not only share information, but also share samples." But she said the travel bans on the country "have caused some challenges for those samples to actually be shipped out of the country."Meanwhile, South Africa's National Institute of Communicable Diseases on Wednesday reported a doubling of coronavirus cases to 8,561 in the past 24 hours. However it said that the number of deaths and hospitalizations had not changed significantly.WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has called for "tailored" travel restrictions, including testing of travelers before and after they arrive in a country, and advised against blanket bans that "place a heavy burden on lives and livelihoods."Michael Ryan, the executive director of WHO's Health Emergencies Programme, said there were "contradictions" inherent in selective travel bans."[Does] the virus read your passport?" he said. "Does the virus know your nationality or where you're legally resident?"Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

And global health is a topic on the minds of many people today, as the coronavirus pandemic rages, a rapidly spreading new variant emerges and countries scramble to vaccinate their populations in the face of aninequitable vaccine rollout.Plus, AIDS is by no means a pandemic of the past.In fact, the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS)warned in a new report this weekthat if leaders don't do more to address inequalities, the world could see some 7.7 million AIDS-related deaths over the next decade — and could remain trapped in the COVID-19 crisis."Progress against the AIDS pandemic, which was already off track, is now under even greater strain as the COVID-19 crisis continues to rage, disrupting HIV prevention and treatment services, schooling, violence-prevention programmes and more," UNAIDS Executive Director Winnie Byanyima said in a statement. "We cannot be forced to choose between ending the AIDS pandemic today and preparing for the pandemics of tomorrow. The only successful approach will achieve both. As of now, we are not on track to achieve either."The report notes that while some countries have made progress, new HIV infections are not falling fast enough globally to stop the pandemic.The new infections (some 1.5 million in 2020) are also "following lines of inequality," UNAIDS says, pointing to the fact that gay men, sex workers and people who use drugs face a 25-to-35-times greater risk of acquiring HIV worldwide.It adds that COVID-19 is "undercutting" the AIDS response in many places, with the pace of HIV testing declining and HIV prevention services — like harm reduction services for people who use drugs — facing disruption in many countries in 2020.The Biden administration acknowledged that the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted "every aspect of the HIV/AIDS response, from prevention to treatment to research," and is marking this World AIDS Day byannouncing several stepsit will take to redouble the fight against HIV/AIDS at home and abroad.Those steps include pledging to host the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Replenishment Conference next year and releasing anew national strategyfor research, policy and planning through 2025. It aims to "aggressively reduce new HIV cases while increasing access to treatment and eliminating inequitable access to medical and support services" to end the U.S. HIV epidemic by 2030.Public health experts say that by addressing root inequities, world leaders can not only end AIDS, but also overcome the COVID-19 crisis and be better prepared for any future pandemics.So what lessons can we apply from AIDS to COVID?Steven Thrasher, a professor at Northwestern University's Medill Journalism School, says the two diseases exploit similar societal weaknesses, like divides along the lines of race, class and power.He spoke to NPR's Ari Shapirolast World AIDS Day about what that might mean for efforts to get vaccines and treatments to those who are the most vulnerable.Thrasher found in his research that the majority of the roughly 33 million people who have died from AIDS over the last four decades actually died after 1996, when effective medication hit the market.He expressed the same concern as many officials and public health experts: That the people who are most at risk of COVID-19 also have the least connection to institutions and financial resources to get the vaccines and treatments they need. The virus could take hold in these populations and worsen existing disparities, he added."Looking back at AIDS, it took seven years from the time antiretroviral therapy came to market before it started getting to every country in the world. And during that time, HIV continued to circulate and, thus, continued to climb," Thrasher said. "And so if we want to tamp down this virus, we need to have a transnational, international approach that's going to help the most vulnerable all over the Earth unless we all want to be just in our houses and not traveling for the next few decades."For more on the similarities between the two pandemics, check out some of NPR's previous coverage:This story originally appeared ontheMorning Editionlive blog.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

The Associated PressA man receives an AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine in Abuja, Nigeria last month. Nigeria has detected its first case of the omicron coronavirus variant in a sample it collected in October, weeks before South Africa alerted the world about the variant last week, the country's national public health institute said Wednesday.Gbemiga Olamikan/APhide captionA man receives an AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine in Abuja, Nigeria last month. Nigeria has detected its first case of the omicron coronavirus variant in a sample it collected in October, weeks before South Africa alerted the world about the variant last week, the country's national public health institute said Wednesday.Nigeria has detected its first case of the omicron coronavirus variant in a sample it collected in October, weeks before South Africa alerted the world about the variant last week, the country's national public health institute said Wednesday.It is the first West African country that has recorded the omicron variant since scientists in southern Africa detected and reported it and adds to a list of nearly 20 countries where the variant has been recorded, triggering travel bans across the world.Genomic sequencing of positive cases of COVID-19 among incoming international travelers has confirmed an omicron case dating back to October, the Nigeria Center for Disease Control said in a statement issued by its director-general. Nigeria has also identified two cases of the omicron variant among travelers who arrived from South Africa last week."Retrospective sequencing of the previously confirmed cases among travelers to Nigeria also identified the omicron variant among the sample collected in October 2021," Nigeria CDC director-general Dr. Ifedayo Adetifa said.Much remains unknown about the new variant, including whether it is more contagious, as some health authorities suspect, whether it makes people more seriously ill, and if it can thwart the vaccine.The Nigeria CDC urged the country's states and the general public to be on alert and called for improved testing amid concerns that Nigeria's low testing capacity might become its biggest challenge in the face of the new variant.Testing for the virus is low in many states and even in the nation's capital, Abuja. For instance, in parts of Kuje, a suburb of Abuja, Musa Ahmed, a public health official, told The Associated Press that no one has been tested for the virus for weeks.The detection of the omicron variant in Africa's most populous nation, with 206 million people, coincides with Nigeria's new requirement that all federal government employees must be inoculated or present a negative COVID-19 test result done in the last 72 hours.With the vaccine mandate taking effect on Wednesday, there were chaotic scenes at several offices in the nation's capital as civil servants without a vaccination card or a negative PCR test were turned away by security agents.Many of the workers and security agents were not wearing face masks."Governments should invest in promoting narratives around vaccine safety, efficacy, and the broader public health security implications of poor vaccines uptake," Adewunmi Emoruwa, lead strategist at Gatefield, an Abuja-based consultancy. "If public servants are convinced about these issues, they are naturally more effective advocates to their constituents."Across Nigeria, the news of the omicron variant — which the World Health Organization has warned poses "very high" risk — has triggered concerns and renewed fears over the COVID-19 pandemic.At the airport in Lagos, Nigeria's largest city and economic hub, authorities insisted that travelers must wear their face masks at the counters, though not much attention is paid to many others flouting health protocols around the airport premises and in the city.Nigeria — with 214,218 confirmed infections including nearly 3,000 deaths — has updated its travel advisory, ordering incoming international travelers to have a PCR test 48 hours before embarking on their trip to the country and two more tests, two days and seven days after arrival. Incoming international arrivals must also isolate for seven days.Amid global concern over the omicron variant, the Nigeria CDC director-general told reporters that the country remains at alert in the face of the emerging crisis."We are working very hard to enhance ongoing surveillance, especially for inbound travelers, and also trying to ramp up testing (including) at the land borders," he said.A slew of nations moved to ban travels from many countries especially southern African nations in the aftermath of the emergence of the omicron variant. But the move has been widely condemned by many including South Africa President Cyril Ramaphosa, who is currently in Nigeria on a two-day visit.Further west on the continent, Liberia launched surveillance along its borders and placed health officers assigned there on full alert although no cases of the omicron variant have been reported there.Liberia's Health Minister Wilhelmina Jallah urged citizens to take preventive measures but not panic. She urged them to take advantage of the vaccination campaign."You cannot go to war if you are not prepared for the war," she said. "And our preparation for this war against COVID-19 — whether it is alpha, delta or omicron — is to protect ourselves by getting at least a jab in your arm ... so we just want to raise this heightened alert."Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Scott HorsleyTraders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange at the start of trading on Monday following Friday's steep decline in global stocks over fears of the new omicron coronavirus variant discovered in South Africa.Spencer Platt/Getty Imageshide captionTraders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange at the start of trading on Monday following Friday's steep decline in global stocks over fears of the new omicron coronavirus variant discovered in South Africa.Stocks took a big tumble on Tuesday as investors weighed the potential economic fallout from the new omicron coronavirus variant.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 652 points."Price increases have spread much more broadly in the recent few months across the economy, and I think the risk of higher inflation has increased," warned Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell intestimony before the Senate Banking Committee.Powell warned that growing concern over the coronavirus, including the  new omicron variant, could make people wary about returning to in-person jobs. That could slow the recovery of the labor market and prolong the supply-chain bottlenecks that have contributed to thehighest inflation in more than three decades.The central bank chief said elevated inflation is likely to continue well into next year.Fed policymakers are set to meet in about two weeks. Powell said that by then, they may have more information about the possible health effects of the omicron variant and how it responds to existing vaccines.With rising price pressures, the central bank has begun to dial back its aggressive bond-buying program, which was put in place in the early part of the coronavirus pandemic to support the financial markets. But Powell suggested that the process could be accelerated, so bond purchases would end a few months earlier than next summer.Ending the bond purchases early would give the Fed more flexibility to raise interest rates, if necessary, to keep inflation from spiraling out of control.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

The Biden administration is banning travel for non-U.S. citizens from several African countries over concerns about the omicron variant.The U.S. is enacting travel bans in an effort to limit the spread of the new omicron variant of the coronavirus, which theWorld Health Organization warns poses a "very high" global risk.Starting Monday, President Biden has imposedtravel restrictionsfor non-U.S. citizens from the following eight countries:TheEuropean Union, Canada, United Kingdom, and Israel have announced travel restrictions from southern African countries as well.Some health officials and public health experts caution that travel restrictions alonemay not be effective in controlling the spread of infectious disease, and could even have harmful effects, like exacerbating xenophobia and deterring countries from being transparent about the state of the virus in the future.The variant was first reported last week in South Africa, where vaccination ratesare about 24%.Cases of the omicron variant havesince been confirmedin Botswana, the United Kingdom, Italy, Germany, Belgium, Israel, the Netherlands, Australia and Hong Kong.Biden is encouraging children and adults to get vaccinated against COVID-19."This pandemic will not end until we have global vaccinations," he saidlast week in a statement.In an addresson Monday, he said the variant is "a cause for concern — not a cause for panic."Tien Le is an intern on NPR's News Desk.This story originally appeared ontheMorning Editionlive blog.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Rachel TreismanA person prepares to administer a Pfizer COVID vaccine at a clinic in Ferguson, Missouri in August 2021. Merriam-Webster has chosen "vaccine" as the word of the year, citing a sustained surge in lookups.Spencer Platt/Getty Imageshide captionA person prepares to administer a Pfizer COVID vaccine at a clinic in Ferguson, Missouri in August 2021. Merriam-Webster has chosen "vaccine" as the word of the year, citing a sustained surge in lookups.In 2020, the Merriam-Webster dictionary selected "pandemic" as itsword of the year.This year, like some59% of fully inoculated Americans, it went with "vaccine."The publishing company noted that the word holds particular significance both as a medical term and a vehicle for ideological conflict."For many, the word symbolized a possible return to the lives we led before the pandemic," it said inMonday's announcement. "But it was also at the center of debates about personal choice, political affiliation, professional regulations, school safety, healthcare inequality, and so much more."The word of the year is determined by data, as Merriam-Webster hasexplained in the past. It must have been a top lookup at Merriam-Webster.com in the past 12 months, and it must have seen a significant increase in lookups over the previous year.That was certainly the case with "vaccine" this year. Lookups for the word increased 601% year-over-year from 2020, and were up 1,048% from 2019, the dictionary said.It notes that interest in the word has been high since the start of the pandemic, with people searching and discussing the funding, development and distribution of vaccines well before they were actually available at pharmacies.And lookups of "vaccine" jumped by 535% in August, which Merriam-Webster says is because "discussions about policy, approval, and vaccination rates — rather than the vaccine itself — sent people to the dictionary."For context: This was around the time when New York and Californiamandated vaccines for health care workers, the Food and Drug Administrationgranted full approvalto the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and the Biden administrationannounced plans for booster shotsfor the general U.S. public, among other headlines."This new higher rate of lookups since August has remained stable throughout the late fall, showing not just a very high interest invaccine, but one that started high and grew during the course of 2021," Merriam-Webster added.And what were people finding when they searched up the word? Merriam-Webster says a new type of vaccine merited a new and improved definition.The company revised its entry for the word in May, since the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines trigger an immune response in an entirely new way.The definition used to be: "A preparation of killed microorganisms, living attenuated organisms, or living fully virulent organisms that is administered to produce or artificially increase immunity to a particular disease." Now, it reads:1 : a preparation that is administered (as by injection) to stimulate the body's immune response against a specific infectious agent or disease: such asa : an antigenic preparation of a typically inactivated or attenuated (see ATTENUATED sense 2) pathogenic agent (such as a bacterium or virus) or one of its components or products (such as a protein or toxin)b : a preparation of genetic material (such as a strand of synthesized messenger RNA) that is used by the cells of the body to produce an antigenic substance (such as a fragment of virus spike protein)The dictionary had several runners up for Word of the Year, rounding out the list to a neat 10. The other contenders include insurrection, perseverance, woke, infrastructure,Murraya, cisgender and Meta. But they couldn't compete with "vaccine" for the top spot."The promising medical solution to the pandemic that upended our lives in 2020 also became a political argument and source of division," it said. "The biggest science story of our time quickly became the biggest debate in our country, and the word at the center of both stories isvaccine."This story originally appeared ontheMorning Editionlive blog.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Brian NaylorAnthony Fauci (right), director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and chief medical adviser to the president, speaks alongside President Biden following a meeting of the COVID-19 response team at the White House on Monday.Anna Moneymaker/Getty Imageshide captionAnthony Fauci (right), director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and chief medical adviser to the president, speaks alongside President Biden following a meeting of the COVID-19 response team at the White House on Monday.President Biden said Monday that whiletravel restrictions imposed on travelersfrom several southern African nations would slow the entry of the omicron variant of the coronavirus, "it cannot prevent it.""Sooner or later, we're going to see cases," he said in an address to the American people.Biden added: "This variant is a cause for concern — not a cause for panic."He reiterated his plea for Americans to get vaccinated as a way to protect themselves against COVID-19."The best protection against this variant or any of the variants out there is getting fully vaccinated and getting a booster shot," he said.Biden said scientists didn't think that extra measures would be needed to fight the new variant, but he added that his administration was working with vaccine manufacturers to develop vaccines or boosters against omicron if needed.He said he will also direct the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention "to use the fastest process available without cutting any corners for safety" to get such vaccines approved and on the market.He said that science adviser Dr. Anthony Fauci believes the current vaccines provide at least some protection against severe disease.The president's remarks came the same day his administration's new travel restrictions went into effect in response to the omicron variant."We're throwing everything we can at this virus," Biden said.Biden said COVID-19 cannot be defeated until the rest of the world is vaccinated, and he urged countries that have abundant vaccines to supply them to those that do not."Delta variants, and now the omicron variant, all emerged elsewhere in the world. So we can't let up until the world is vaccinated," he said.The president also dismissed the need for another lockdown to curb the spread of the virus."If people are vaccinated and wear their mask, there's no need for a lockdown," he said.Asked whether he expects the spread and response to the new variant to be the "new normal," Biden said no and said that he expects the new normal to be "everyone ends up getting vaccinated" and with a booster shot, and to reduce the number of people who aren't protected to "such a low degree that we're not seeing the spread of these viruses."Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

The United States, Israel and other European nations have already imposed travel restrictions on South Africa and other nations in the region.Jerome Delay/APhide captionPeople line up to get on the Air France flight to Paris at OR Tambo's airport in Johannesburg, South Africa, on Friday. The United States, Israel and other European nations have already imposed travel restrictions on South Africa and other nations in the region.When the omicron variant of COVID-19 was first identified in South Africa, the country's scientists werequick to informglobal health leaders of the new mutations they had found.Though scientists have little information about the new variant and aren't certain where it originated, several countries, including the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and the European Union announced almost immediatetravel bansfrom South Africa and other southern African nations.As the week began, Japan followed suit with far more restrictive measures.Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida announced Monday the decision to reestablish entry rules for foreign travelers to limit any potential spread of the omicron variant. This comes just weeks after the country reopened its borders on Nov. 8.Kishida told reporters this step is a "temporary measure until information about the omicron variant becomes clear."Israelalso implemented a blanket banto all foreigners Sunday night after initially establishing restrictions on travelers just from southern African countries.According toThe Jerusalem Post, under this new policy anyone returning from any country — vaccinated Israelis included — will need to isolate for three days once in the country.The restrictive measures around the world sparkedoutcryfrom some health officials and experts who caution that the bans are premature and could set a harmfulprecedent."There is very little utility of these kinds of bans," Saad Omer, director of the Yale Institute of Global Health, told NPR."Unfortunately, from what we know about the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 and the epidemiology of this variant, the horse has probably left the barn," Omer said, noting the high transmissibility of this coronavirus and its variants.And even though the omicron variant has been reported in several other countries in Europe, Asia and North America, travel bans are largely being imposed on southern African countries.One of the identified cases of the omicron variant inBelgiumhad no contact or travel with any nations in southern Africa, suggesting community spread could already be taking place."If the question is to prevent the variant from coming in, it really doesn't make sense to exempt countries where it has been identified and that has even more direct flights than southern Africa," Omer said.Travel bans from the start of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted ineconomicandotherconsequences we're still seeing today.Arecent studyfrom the journalScienceshows that restricting international travel in the beginning stages of the COVID-19 pandemic did have some effect on delaying spread, but the researchers said restricting travel is only truly effective when paired with curbing the spread of infection through hand-washing, isolation and early detection.Anotherstudy, in theJournal of Emergency Management, concluded that little evidence exists to prove that international travel bans are effective in controlling the spread of infectious disease, and such measures should only be taken if recommended by the World Health Organization. With the omicron variant, theWHO has already cautioned againstimposing travel bans.Dr. Margaret Harris, a public health doctor and a spokesperson for the World Health Organization, told NPR'sMorning Editionthat the restrictions do give countries some "breathing space" in their early responses to omicron.She urged governments to "make the most of that time. Build up your hospital capacity, build up your tracking and tracing, build up your surveillance, prepare."However,introducing a travel ban can give a false sense that the virus is being contained, researchers said, adding that such policies can also make it difficult to transport health care workers and other resources.Additionally, the stigma of travel bans can exacerbate racism and xenophobia,according to Nicole Errettof the University of Washington, who was the lead author on theJournal of Emergency Managementstudy.Omer, of the Yale Institute of Global Health, has another concern about implementing travel bans during a public health crisis: It can dampen the commitment to scientific transparency.When countries that are proactive about disclosing the circulation of a virus are hit with travel restrictions, he said, that undercuts the case for health officials to be forthcoming about what's happening in their countries."You don't want a situation where, a month from now, a country health minister ... gets a result of sequenced virus and they say, 'OK, if it is that widespread, it's going to come out anyways from some other country, why be the first one?' And that cycle starts," said Omer.Addressing vaccine inequity around the world is the best way to stop these new variants from emerging, Omer said."If there are more transmission events going on with every hour, with every day, with every week, the likelihood of a variant emerging goes up," he said.And one of the most effective ways to address inequity, Omer said, is to allow for all regions, low-income countries in particular, to producetheir ownvaccines.It's too early to tell whether the omicron variant in particular will become a serious public health threat, Omer added, "but that doesn't mean that we are not playing with fire by by letting vaccine inequity continue."Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Deepa ShivaramPresident Biden speaks to media as he arrives on Air Force One at Andrews Air Force Base, Md.,  on Sunday after returning from Nantucket, Mass., after spending the Thanksgiving holiday there.Carolyn Kaster/APhide captionPresident Biden speaks to media as he arrives on Air Force One at Andrews Air Force Base, Md.,  on Sunday after returning from Nantucket, Mass., after spending the Thanksgiving holiday there.As more cases of the omicron variant are revealed around the world, President Biden was briefed Sunday by his COVID-19 response team, including his chief medical adviser Dr. Anthony Fauci.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has not announced any cases of the omicron variant in the U.S., but Fauci said Sunday that it isinevitablethat there will be confirmed cases at some point.The variant has already been identified in cases in Botswana, the United Kingdom, Italy, Germany, Belgium, Israel, the Netherlands, Australia and Hong Kong.Scientists are not certain where the variant originated, but the mutations of the virus were first identified by scientists in South Africa and the World Health Organization deemed it a "variant of concern" on Friday, given its already rapid spread.The Netherlands identified 13 cases of the variant and Australia confirmed two cases, on Saturday, marking an even wider spread to other regions of the world. On Sunday, Canada announced it had detected two cases of the new variant.The cases in theNetherlandscame from passengers on a flight coming back from South Africa, where 61 of the passengers aboard tested positive for COVID-19. The two cases inAustraliacame from passengers arriving from southern Africa, but it was not specified which country or countries they were returning from.The United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Israel, the European Union have already announced they have restricted travel from South Africa and several other countries in the region, though the World Health Organization has cautioned against imposing travel bans at this time.More countries, including New Zealand, Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore, Sri Lanka, the Maldives and Saudi Arabia have also implemented travel restrictions.On Saturday, the U.K. announcedstrictertravel measures for all travelers. Now, a PCR test is required for anyone coming into the country by the end of the second day of arrival. Anyone who is a close contact of someone who tests positive for the omicron variant has to self-isolate for 10 days, regardless of vaccination status. Germany also announced new measures that anyone coming in from South Africa would have to quarantine for 14 days.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Wynne DavisFollowing the discovery of a new COVID-19 variant, the United Kingdom imposed new restrictions on arriving travelers from South Africa and other southern African countries. The U.S. is implementing similar restrictions starting Monday.Hollie Adams/Getty Imageshide captionFollowing the discovery of a new COVID-19 variant, the United Kingdom imposed new restrictions on arriving travelers from South Africa and other southern African countries. The U.S. is implementing similar restrictions starting Monday.Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease doctor and the president's chief medical adviser, said on Sunday that it's inevitable that the omicron variant of the coronavirus will be detected in the U.S.While no cases of the variant have been detected in the U.S. so far, there have been cases detected in Botswana, the United Kingdom, Italy, Germany, Belgium, Israel, the Netherlands, Australia and Hong Kong."As we all know, when you have a virus that has already gone to multiple countries, inevitably it will be here," Fauci said on ABC'sThis Week."The question is: Will we be prepared for it?"The omicron variant was labeled as a "variant of concern" by the World Health Organization on Friday, making it the first variant to be labeled as such since the delta variant emerged earlier this year.Fauci stressed that a lot of the preparation for omicron is similar to that for the delta variant."If and when, and it's going to be when, it comes here, hopefully we will be ready for it by enhancing our capabilities via vaccine, masking — all the things that we do, and should be doing," Fauci said.Part of the concern around the omicron variant has to do with the variant's mutations — it has far more than any earlier variant. Fauci said more data is needed to know for sure, but that "the mutation would strongly suggest that it would be more transmissible and that it might evade ... perhaps even antibodies that are induced by vaccine."But Dr. Francis Collins, the National Institutes of Health director, says "there's no reason to panic" just yet.Collins appeared on CNN'sState of the Unionsaid he thinks people who have already been vaccinated "will probably be OK," but that scientists will likely need two or three weeks to determine that.Collins also stressed the need for people to get vaccinated and for those who are fully vaccinated to get their booster shots."The booster — it basically enlarges the capacity of your immune system to recognize all kinds of different spike proteins it's never seen," Collins said.While both Fauci and Collins say it will take a bit of time to determine the severity of the omicron variant, the U.S. is puttingnew travel restrictions in place.The restrictions are set to take effect on Monday.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Jason BeaubienOn November 29, the World Health Organization will convene a virtual summit for its member states to consider the handling of future outbreaks. Pictured above: WHO headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland.Sean Gallup/Getty Imageshide captionOn November 29, the World Health Organization will convene a virtual summit for its member states to consider the handling of future outbreaks. Pictured above: WHO headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland.The World Health Organization is convening a special session of its governing body, the World Health Assembly, to start talks on a new global treaty covering pandemics. Representatives of WHO's 194 member states will meet virtually for three days starting on Monday to consider new international rules for handling future outbreaks.The head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, says the world has not worked well together to confront the current COVID-19 pandemic."Everybody has seen to what extent we were really disorganized and all have seen the failures of the global system," Tedros says.Those failures during the current pandemic have been many, says Tedros.The first was the slow response to containing the initial outbreak, say public health specialists. They also point to conflicts over the lack of transparency and information sharing, particularly by China. Some countries were accused of hoarding of medical supplies. Then when vaccines were finally developed, poorer nations have complained that they weren't shared equitably. A final concern, the experts say: The global response to the crisis is led by an underfunded World Health Organization that has no power to force any nation to do anything.The idea behind this upcoming session of theWorld Health Assembly, Tedros says, is to start sketching out a new world order to handle future health crises."We don't have rules of the game," Tedros says of the current situation. "To manage shared problems, like pandemics, you need laws and rules that bring obligations to countries. That's what we miss. And I hope countries will agree to a binding pact so that pandemics can be managed better."The nearly 200 nations and territories that are members of the World Health Organization will have a chance to weigh in on what should or shouldn't be in such a binding pact.Many low-income countries are stressing "equity" in the talks and want wealthy nations to commit to making new vaccines, diagnostic tests, drugs and other resources universally available.Wealthy nations want increased international access to information and the areas where outbreaks originate. But some governments, particularly China's, view this as a violation of their sovereignty.A new set of international pandemic rules might mean the next outbreak is contained more quickly. Nonetheless, asking political leaders to commit to being good global citizens in the midst of a deadly crisis rather than looking out for their own national interests is a hard sell.Suerie Moon, co-director of theGlobal Health Center at the Graduate Institute of Geneva,says COVID has demonstrated that the world desperately needs a new international framework to deal with 21st century pandemics and the massive damage they can cause. She says the upcoming negotiations at the World Health Assembly are a litmus test for world leaders."After arguably the greatest shared global catastrophe since the Second World War," she asks, "are our leaders going to show even a fraction of the ambition, a fraction of the vision that we saw back in 1945?"This special session of the World Health Assembly aims simply to start negotiations for a new pandemic treaty. The group may also decide to revamp existing international health regulations — or choose to do nothing at all.And if a new international treaty is proposed, it could still take years to ratify if history is any guide, says Moon. Different versions of the proposal will likely be argued over and renegotiated. And each country would need to sign on and push the deal through their domestic treaty ratification process."We'll have to see how this plays out in the coming two, three or four years," she says. "I hope it doesn't last longer than that, but certainly it's not realistic that this would be done in a year."The World Health Assembly runs through Wednesday.By the end of the three-day meeting, Moon says, it should be clear whether there's the political will to craft new international rules on how to handle the next global health crisis.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
The Associated PressTravelers wearing protective face masks arrive to Ben Gurion Airport near Tel Aviv, Israel on Sunday. Israel on Sunday approved barring entry to foreign nationals as part of its efforts to clamp down on a new coronavirus variant.Ariel Schalit/APhide captionTravelers wearing protective face masks arrive to Ben Gurion Airport near Tel Aviv, Israel on Sunday. Israel on Sunday approved barring entry to foreign nationals as part of its efforts to clamp down on a new coronavirus variant.THE HAGUE, Netherlands — The Netherlands confirmed 13 cases of the new omicron variant of the coronavirus on Sunday and Australia found two as the countries half a world apart became the latest to detect it in travelers arriving from southern Africa.A raft of curbs being imposed by nations around the world as they scramble to slow the variant's spread also grew, with Israel deciding Sunday to bar entry to foreign nationals in the toughest move so far.Confirmed or suspected cases of thenew varianthave already emerged in several European countries, in Israel and in Hong Kong, just days after it was identified by researchers in South Africa. The "act first, ask questions later" approach reflected growing alarm about the emergence of a potentially more contagious variant nearly two years into a pandemic that has killed more than 5 million people, upended lives and disrupted economies across the globe.While much remains to be learned about the new variant, researchers are concerned that it may be more resistant to the protection provided by vaccines and could mean that the pandemic lasts for longer than anticipated.The Dutch public health authority confirmed that 13 people who arrived from South Africa Friday have so far tested positive for omicron. They were among 61 people who tested positive for the virus after arriving on the last two flights to Amsterdam's Schiphol airport before a flight ban was implemented. They were immediately put into isolation, most at a nearby hotel, while sequencing was carried out.Authorities in Australia said two overseas travelers who arrived in Sydney from Africa became the first in the country to test positive for the omicron variant. Arrivals from nine African countries are now required to quarantine in a hotel upon arrival. Two German states reported a total of three cases in returning travelers over the weekend.Israel movedto ban entry by foreigners and mandate quarantine for all Israelis arriving from abroad."Restrictions on the country's borders is not an easy step, but it's a temporary and necessary step," Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting.Travelers walk with their luggage in the Ben Gurion Airport near Tel Aviv, Israel on Sunday.Ariel Schalit/APhide captionTravelers walk with their luggage in the Ben Gurion Airport near Tel Aviv, Israel on Sunday.Dr. Ran Balicer, head of the government's advisory panel on COVID-19, told Israel's Kan public radio that the new measures were necessary for the "fog of war" surrounding the new variant, saying it was "better to act early and strictly" to prevent its spread.Dutch Health Minister Hugo de Jonge said he has asked his country's public health institute for advice on whether additional travel restrictions are needed, but he said he wants to coordinate with his European Union counterparts because "I think those are really steps that we will have to take together."Many countries have restricted or banned travel from various southern African countries — among the latest New Zealand, Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore, Sri Lanka, the Maldives and Saudi Arabia. Places that already had imposed restrictions include Brazil, Canada, the EU, Iran, and the U.S. This goes against the advice of the World Health Organization, which has warned against any overreaction before the variant is thoroughly studied.South Africa's government responded angrily to the travel bans, which it said are "akin to punishing South Africa for its advanced genomic sequencing and the ability to detect new variants quicker." It said it will try to persuade countries that imposed them to reconsider."Whilst we respect the right of all countries to take the necessary precautionary measures to protect their citizens, we need to remember that this pandemic requires collaboration and sharing of expertise," the minister for international relations and cooperation, Naledi Pandor, said in a statement.The United States' top infectious diseases expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said he would not be surprised if the omicron variant was already in the U.S., though it hasn't yet been detected there.In Europe, much of which already has been struggling with a sharp increase in cases over recent weeks, officials also were on guard.The U.K. on Saturday tightened rules on mask-wearing and on testing of international arrivals after finding two omicron cases. Spain announced it won't admit unvaccinated British visitors starting Dec. 1.Italy was going through lists of airline passengers who arrived in the past two weeks after a business traveler who returned from Mozambique and landed in Rome on Nov. 11 tested positive for omicron. The Lazio region's top health official, Alessio D'Amato, said that "controls at airports, ports and train stations have been reinforced."French Health Minister Olivier Veran said that, while his country had no confirmed cases yet, "it is probable that there currently are cases in circulation."While it is not clear yet how existing vaccines work against the omicron variant, Veran said France isn't changing its strategy to fight the latest surge of infections driven by the delta variant, which centers on increasing vaccinations and boosters.David Hui, a respiratory medicine expert and government adviser on the pandemic in Hong Kong, said that even though it is not clear if current coronavirus vaccines are effective against the new variant, the city's vaccination rate should be increased and booster doses should be implemented as soon as possible.He said that the two people who tested positive for the omicron variant had received the BioNTech-Pfizer shot and exhibited very mild symptoms, such as a sore throat."Vaccines should work but there would be some reduction in effectiveness," he said.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Kerry SheridanFromVezna Hang and his son. Hang fell so ill with COVID-19 before being vaccinated that he needed a double lung transplant. He now encourages other people to get the shot.Vezna Hanghide captionVezna Hang and his son. Hang fell so ill with COVID-19 before being vaccinated that he needed a double lung transplant. He now encourages other people to get the shot.About one in 10 lung transplants in the United States now go to COVID-19 patients, according to data from the United Network for Organ Sharing, or UNOS.The trend is raising questions about the ethics of allocating a scarce resource to people who have chosen not to be vaccinated against the coronavirus."They are accumulating on a steady basis. So it's very much a real thing," says David Klassen, chief medical officer for UNOS."If there were more lungs available for transplants, I believe the numbers would be greater than they are," he says.In all, 238 people across the country have received lung transplants due to COVID-19 since the first such operations were tracked in August of 2020, according to the latest UNOS figures from October of this year.Lung transplants for COVID patients rose tenfold between the first year of the pandemic and 2021, according to UNOS data, which also shows transplants for other top lung diseases, like emphysema, cystic fibrosis and pulmonary fibrosis, are down compared to prior years."It's happening in the U.S. It's also happening in Canada. There was just a paper out from Western Canada about this causing a huge surge in the number of lung transplants there. It's a big problem," says David Mulligan, chair of the Yale-New Haven Health Transplantation Center.More than 2,000 lung transplant operations are usually done each year in the U.S., costing around$1.2 million for a double lung transplant.The rise in COVID-related transplants is forcing doctors to grapple with how to best manage who gets them, especially now that vaccines are widely available."When somebody contracts such severe COVID that they need a lung transplant, and they got it refusing to get a vaccine, it's a really ethical dilemma," says Mulligan. "How can they just jump in and take a lung away from somebody who's sick, but has been doing the best they can to take care of themselves and avoid getting COVID?"Transplant centers weigh a lot of different factors when listing people who need an organ. But social and behavioral factors — such as how people came to be sick — are not usually among them.People who smoked can be eligible for a lung transplant, just like people who drank alcohol in excess can also be listed for a new liver if they've stayed smoke-free or sober for six months.Not judging people's past behavior is fairly standard in medicine. But future behavior, when it comes to transplants, is fair game, according to Olivia Kates, an assistant professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins."I think [COVID-19 patients] should be subject to the same expectation, that they should either be vaccinated or be able to demonstrate immunity to COVID-19 going forward, so that their next set of lungs is not subject to the same risk," Kates says.Some transplant centershave said patients will lose their spot on the list if they are not vaccinated against coronavirus.But some say eliminating anyone who hasn't had a COVID vaccine from even being considered for an organ may be unfair because it could exclude racial, religious or ethnic groups that have lower vaccination rates.The current system of waitlisting people for transplant strives for equity and prioritizes "people who can't wait much longer for their organ, but if they get one, they have a good chance of being able to benefit and keep that organ," says Govind Persad, who teaches bioethics and health law at the University of Denver.Candidates for lung transplants after COVID-19 are often young and otherwise healthy, like 41-year-old Vezna Hang. He got COVID in March of this year, not long after moving to Tampa from New York. His symptoms were barely noticeable, just a loss of taste and smell at first.Vezna Hang and his son, visiting outside the hospital in spring 2021.Vezna Hanghide caption"One day, I just looked in the mirror and saw that my lips and my fingertips were blue," he says.Hang had no underlying conditions. But COVID-19 caused inflammation in his lungs that led to permanent scars. A transplant was his only option."For the first moment in my life, I was scared. And from day to day, there were times that I honestly didn't think I was going to make it. And to leave behind my son, you know, that was heavily on my mind."The father of a 5-year-old, Hang was not vaccinated when he fell ill. Florida didn't open up vaccine access to his age group, 40 and up, until late March, after he got sick.But Hang understands people who are unsure about getting the shot. He says he was one of them before he got sick."This horrible virus hits everybody different. It's not predictable at all," Hang says."From what I experienced, being inside the hospital setting, and seeing all the people that weren't vaccinated being hospitalized, it really made me push to get myself vaccinated, my family and encourage my friends," he added.There is no national, overarching policy on how to handle vaccine refusal when it comes to transplants. The American Society of Transplant Surgeonsrecommends vaccination for anyone awaiting a transplant. Doctors say that's because the immune response is stronger if a patient gets the vaccine before, rather than after, their transplant.Deborah Adey, a kidney transplant specialist at the University of California San Francisco says that often it's not the patients who are difficult to convince."Where we have run into trouble has been with caregivers," says Adey, who has seen patients who were transplanted years ago fall dangerously ill with COVID after living with unvaccinated family members."There have always been anti-vaxxers around. That's not exactly new. But this degree of resistance to doing something for the public good? I've just never seen anything like this," Adey adds.Community exposure poses serious risks, especially with a highly contagious variant like delta, says Kiran Dhanireddy, executive director of the transplant institute at Tampa General Hospital."Particularly in this last surge, we've had several transplant patients die of COVID" he says. "And these were patients that were for the majority vaccinated, but because their immune systems are suppressed, they don't mount a normal immunologic response to the vaccine, and therefore don't have the same degree of protection as a normal individual would."People who live with donated organs must take immune-suppressing drugs for life in order to prevent their bodies from attacking and rejecting the new organs, making them more vulnerable to COVID-19 as long as it's around.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

The omicron variant, first identified in South Africa, has been confirmed in several countries.Jerome Delay/APhide captionA person waits to be tested for COVID-19 in Johannesburg, South Africa, on Saturday. The omicron variant, first identified in South Africa, has been confirmed in several countries.A new strain of COVID-19 first discovered in South Africa was declared a variant of concern by the World Health Organization on Friday. Here's how the pharmaceutical industry plans to address the latest coronavirus curveball.Vaccine-makers are already pivoting their efforts to combat the new variant by testing higher doses of booster shots, designing new boosters that anticipate strain mutations, and developing omicron-specific boosters.In a statement sent to NPR, Moderna said it has been working on a comprehensive strategy to predict variants of concern since the beginning of 2021. One approach is to double the current booster from 50 to 100 micrograms. Secondly, the vaccine-maker has been studying twobooster vaccines that are designed to anticipate mutations like those found in the omicron variant. The company also said it will ramp up efforts to make a booster candidate that specifically targets omicron."From the beginning, we have said that as we seek to defeat the pandemic, it is imperative that we are proactive as the virus evolves," said Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel. "The mutations in the Omicron variant are concerning and for several days, we have been moving as fast as possible to execute our strategy to address this variant."Pfizer and BioNTechtold Reutersthat they expect more data about the omicron variant to be collected within two weeks. That information will help determine whether they need to modify their current vaccine. Pfizer and BioNTech said a vaccine tailored for the omicron variant, if needed, could be ready to ship in approximately 100 days.Johnson & Johnson said in a statement sent to NPR that it too is already testing its vaccine's efficacy against the new variant.Theomicron variantwasfirst reported to the WHO on Nov. 24, the WHO said. Preliminary evidence indicates the variant poses an increased risk for reinfection due to the large number of mutations. Until recently, cases across South Africa have predominantly been from the delta variant, an earlier strain that has pushed health care systems to the max since early summer. But omicron infections have been on the rise in recent weeks,the WHO reported.More concerning, omicron cases have emerged across the globe. Cases have been confirmed in Botswana, the United Kingdom, Italy, Germany, Belgium, Israel,the Netherlands, Australiaand Hong Kong.News of the rapidly spreading variant led to a new set ofair travel restrictionsfrom South Africa and seven other countries, implemented byPresidentBiden, that go into effect Monday. The president made the announcement the day after Thanksgiving, one of the busiest travel periods of the year.Unlike last year, whenmillions of people traveled against the advice of health experts, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and chief medical adviser to the president,Dr. Anthony Fauci, more or less condoned Thanksgiving get-togethers for vaccinated Americans. And, according to anAmerican Automobile Associationtravel forecast, more than 53 million people were expected to travel for Thanksgiving — an 18% jump compared to last year — including more than 4 million by air.As of Friday, theCDC saidthat no cases of the omicron variant had been identified in the United States. However, Fauci said on Saturday that he would not be surprised if the variant is already here."We have not detected it yet, but when you have a virus that is showing this degree of transmissibility and you're already having travel-related cases that they've noted in Israel and Belgium and other places ... it almost invariably is ultimately going to go essentially all over," hesaid in an interview on theTodayshow.As Americans prepare to transition from one busy holiday to the next, theCDC is predictingthat coronavirus cases, hospitalizations and deaths will increase over the next four weeks. More than 776,000 people in the U.S. have died of COVID-19 to date,according to Johns Hopkins University's tracker, and the country isprojectedto surpass 800,000 deaths by Christmas.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

Therestrictions, which are set to take effect on Monday, are being implemented out of an abundance of caution, said a senior Biden administration official.The World Health Organization announced Friday that it deems this strain, B.1.1.529,a variant of concern, and has named it omicron. It's the first new variant of concern since delta.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced Friday night that no cases of omicron have been identified to date in the U.S., but that the agency has surveillance systems in place and it expects the variant will be identified quickly if it emerges in the U.S.Here's what we know so far about the new variant — and what we don't.The omicron variant has been detected at faster rates than previous surges have been, suggesting it may have advantages over other variants.The WHO says that the detection of the variant in South Africa coincided with a steep increase in cases there and that its prevalence is increasing in almost all provinces of the country. The variant has caused a particularly sharp rise in cases in the city of Pretoria, where it went from being essentially undetectable several weeks ago to now dominating the outbreak in a major city. Cases have also cropped up in Botswana, Belgium, Hong Kong and Israel during a relatively short period of time.Scientists don't know yet, but they believe it has to do with the variant's mutations. "This variant has a large number of mutations. And those mutations have some worrying characteristics," said Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove with the WHO's Health Emergencies Program, in avideo statement. Scientists say the variant has a number of mutations that are known to boost transmissibility and others that can help the virus infect cells more easily.Still, scientists caution that there isn't enough data yet to know for sure whether that's the case.There are hints in the virus's genes that vaccines could be less effective against it and that there there could be a higher risk of reinfections.But in aninterview with NPR'sAll Things Considered, Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, said: "Let me be clear, there is no data at the present time to indicate that the current vaccines would not work."The concern here is based on the fact that some of omicron's mutations are ones that are already known to help the virus evade the immune system — to resist antibodies and avoid detection by some of the body's front-line defenders.But again, scientists don't have enough data to say for sure.A passenger checks an electronic flight notice board displaying canceled flights at OR Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg, South Africa.Phill Magakoe/AFP via Getty Imageshide captionA passenger checks an electronic flight notice board displaying canceled flights at OR Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg, South Africa.Researchers in South Africa and elsewhere are working to understand whether it could evade immunity; they're taking blood from people who have been vaccinated and then seeing how well the antibodies in their blood work against the omicron variant. They hope to have more data in a few weeks."It's really important that we have good SARS-CoV-2 surveillance around the world, including better genomic sequencing, because we want to be able to detect this virus where it's circulating," said the WHO's Van Kerkhove. She said the WHO's technical advisory group for virus evolution will be reviewing new studies as they come out to see whether there are any changes in severity of disease or any impact on diagnostics, therapeutics or vaccines."It's really important that these studies are done and done comprehensively," she said.The list of countries includes South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Eswatini, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and Namibia. The policy does not apply to American citizens or lawful permanent residents, but they must still test negative for the coronavirus prior to travel. About a dozen other countries have taken similar action, including the U.K. and some countries in Europe.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

Stocks dropped after a coronavirus variant appears to be spreading across the globe.Stock markets around the world tumbled on Friday after scientists in South Africa identifieda new, fast-spreading variant of the coronavirus, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average recording its biggest single-day drop of the year.At one point, the Dow fell more than 1,000 points before recovering slightly to close down 905 points, or about 2.5%, for the session. Oil prices dropped more than 10%, their steepest one-day decline since early in the pandemic.Virologists are rushing to learn more about thevariant of the virus that causes COVID-19 that wasfirst identified in Botswana, and which is rapidly outcompeting other versions of the virus in the region of South Africa that includes Johannesburg.The United States said it will restrict travelers from South Africa and seven other countries starting Monday. It joined at least 10 other countries restricting travel from the region, including Belgium, Britain, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, Japan, Malta, the Netherlands, the Philippines and Singapore,The New York Timesreported.The variant, currentlydenominated B.1.1.529, reportedly could have farmore mutationsthan those displayed by the delta variant, which became the dominant variant in most of the world over the summer.It's not clear yet whether the mutations make this variant more infectious or whether it causes more severe illness, butresearchers say the high number of mutations to the "spike proteins"— the focus of a body's immune response — may make it more able to get past the body's defenses.Despite the spread of this variant, the number of COVID-19 cases in South Africa is still well below the delta surge earlier this year. But numbers are beginning to tick up again.The European Commission recommended its members block travel from countries where the variant has been found, as Belgium reported a case, accordingto the BBC. The broadcaster said in addition to Botswana and South Africa, cases have also shown up in Hong Kong and Israel.The World Health Organization called an emergency meeting on Friday, where itnamed the new variantomicron, after the 15th letter of the Greek alphabet, and designated it a "Variant of Concern.""This news is putting the handbrake on markets," Peter Rutter, the head of equities at Royal London Asset Management, toldReuters."There is a huge range of outcomes that can happen. We could have serious lockdowns or we get no lockdowns and a booming economy," Rutter said. "The very fact we don't know, is what's concerning the market."The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 were also down more than 2% on Friday, as U.S. markets closed early for the holiday.Even after the global selloff, U.S. stock markets remain in positive territory for the year. The Dow is up more than 15% since the beginning of 2021, while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq are both up more than 20%.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Rhitu ChatterjeeThe Oneida Indian Nation unveiled a cultural art installation called "Passage of Peace," which features nine illuminated tipis seen off the New York State Thruway to raise awareness of the impact of COVID-19 on Native Americans.Oneida Indian Nationhide captionThe Oneida Indian Nation unveiled a cultural art installation called "Passage of Peace," which features nine illuminated tipis seen off the New York State Thruway to raise awareness of the impact of COVID-19 on Native Americans.The past year and a half have been stressful on many fronts for Chris Aragon, a caregiver for his older brother who has cerebral palsy."The left side of his body is atrophied and smaller than his right side, and he has trouble getting around. He's kind of like a big teenager," says Aragon, 60, who is part Apache and lives with his brother on theFort Berthold Reservationof the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation, in North Dakota.His main goal throughout the pandemic has been to keep his brother safe from COVID-19, and "it's really been a struggle," he says.The pandemic has been a financial stressor, too, says Aragon. He worked reduced hours last year, and had periods with no work recently. "I'd wake up at night to go to the restroom, and then I wouldn't be able to go back to sleep."Aragon is among the 74% of American Indian and Alaska Natives who said someone in their household has struggled with depression, anxiety, stress and problems with sleeping, ina recent pollby NPR, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Only 52% of white people said the same.Loading...COVID exacerbated long standing stresses created by historic inequities, saysSpero Manson, who's Pembina Chippewa from North Dakota, and directs the University of Colorado'sCenters for American Indian and Alaska Native Health.Native communities in the United States have had higher rates of infection, are3.3 times more likely to be hospitalizedand more than twice as likely to die from the disease than whites. And half of Native Americans in NPR's poll said they're facing serious financial problems."As we struggle to address the sudden and precipitous added stresses posed by the hour by the pandemic, it heightens that sense of pain, suffering of helplessness and hopelessness," says Manson. And it's manifesting in higher rates of anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, he adds."I think the pandemic has definitely triggered this historical trauma that Native people do experience," saysAdrianne Maddux, the executive director at Denver Indian Health and Family Services, which runs a primary care clinic.She's witnessed a higher demand for behavioral health services, including addiction treatment. "Our therapists were inundated," says Maddux.But native communities also have unique strengths that have helped them approach the COVID crisis with resilience, says Manson. Tribes have responded to the pandemic with new initiatives to stay connected and support one another."American and Alaska Native people, we are very social and collective in our understanding of who we are, how we reaffirm this sense of personhood and self," says Manson. "Some of the strength and resilience is in how collective and social these communities are."Part of the struggle in the pandemic has been "having a limited ability to get together and gather for things like powwows and ceremonies and other events that really keep us connected," saysVictoria O'Keefe, a member of the Cherokee and Seminole Nations, and a psychologist at the Center for American Indian Health at Johns Hopkins University. And she adds, there's "collective grief, especially grief around losing elders and cultural keepers."But that collective mindset has also brought people together to heal. "We really see so many communities mobilizing and are really determined to protect each other," says O'Keefe. "This is driven by shared values across tribes such as connectedness, and living in relation to each other, living in relation to all living beings and our lands. And we protect our families, our communities, our elders, our cultural keepers."That was evident in the Navajo Nation, says O'Keefe's colleague,Joshuaa Allison-Burbank, a member of the Navajo Nation and a speech language pathologist at the Center for American Indian Health."This concept of Navajo of K'é," he says. "It means family kinship ties."Native tribes have responded to the pandemic with creative ways to stay connected. Veronica Concho and Raymond Concho Jr. grew traditional Pueblo foods and Navajo crops with their grandchildren Kaleb and Kateri Allison-Burbank in Waterflow, N.M.Joshuaa Allison-Burbankhide captionNative tribes have responded to the pandemic with creative ways to stay connected. Veronica Concho and Raymond Concho Jr. grew traditional Pueblo foods and Navajo crops with their grandchildren Kaleb and Kateri Allison-Burbank in Waterflow, N.M.Allison-Burbank spent the early months of the pandemic working on the frontlines at a COVID care clinic of the Indian Health Services in Shiprock, N.M. He says people were quick to start masking and social distancing."That's what was so important for getting a grasp and controlling viral spread across the Navajo Nation was going back to this concept with respect to other humans, respect to elders," says Allison-Burbank. "It's also the concept of taking care of one another, taking care of the land."It also helped communities find creative solutions to other pandemic-related crises, like food shortages, he adds.Left: Josiah Concho and his nephew Kaleb Allison-Burbank helped grow produce in Waterflow, N.M., during the summer of last year. They then gave the crops to native families in need. Right: Joshuaa Allison-Burbank and his family hung red chiles to dehydrate.

They then gave the crops to native families in need. Right: Joshuaa Allison-Burbank and his family hung red chiles to dehydrate. The excess produce helped combat food shortages in their communities.Many people, including his own family, started farming and cooking traditional crops like corn and squash, which they previously ate only during traditional ceremonies."My whole family, we were able to farm traditional Pueblo Foods and Navajo crops," says Allison-Burbank. "And not just have enough for ourselves, but we had an abundance of to share with our extended family, our neighbors and to contribute to various mutual aid organizations."He says farming also allowed community members to spend more time together safely — which helped buffer some of the stress.Families also had more time to speak their native language and practice certain cultural routines, which he thinks helped people emotionally.Allison-Burbank, O'Keefe and their colleagues at the Center for American Indian Health also spearheaded an effort to help American Indian and Alaska Native children cope during the pandemic. They wrote, published and distributed a children's story book calledOur Smallest Warriors, Our Strongest Medicine: Overcoming COVID-19.The book, which was illustrated by a native youth artist, tells the story of two kids whose mother is a health care worker treating people with COVID-19. So, the kids turn to their grandmother, who helps them navigate their fears and anxieties."Storytelling is an important and long standing tradition for tribal communities," says O'Keefe. "And we found that this was a way that we could weave together our shared cultural values across tribes, as well as public health guidance and mental health coping strategies to help native children and families."Over 70,000 copies of the book have been distributed across 100 tribes, says O'Keefe. In addition to the book, parent resources and children's activities areavailable for free on the center's website.On the Berthold Reservation, where Aragon lives, he says tribal leaders were "very proactive" about supporting people with COVID-19 and their families. "All [people] had to do was pick up the phone and call to get extra help, or get groceries brought to their house," he says.Authorities also helped individuals with COVID-19 isolate, using cabins at a local campground, so that they could minimize the risk of exposing other family members, he says.And people took the time to help the elderly, he adds. "They definitely treat their elders well here, and they're not just forgotten and put in a nursing home somewhere."Tribal youth in Minneapolis had similar efforts to take care of elders in their community, assisting them with getting food, medicine and other tasks, says Manson."This reflects an enormous sense of importance of elders in our communities as the repositories of cultural knowledge and our spiritual leaders," he says, as well as the importance of intergenerational relationships.The Oneida Indian Nation, which is located in upstate New York, recently unveiled an art installation to increase awareness about the disproportionate impact of the pandemic on Native communities as well as resources around COVID-19. TitledPassage of Peace, the installation features large tipis, which are traditional homes and gathering places.The installation is located just off of the New York State Thruway, about midway between Syracuse and Utica. "We hope the Passage of Peace will bring attention to continued hardship taking place in many parts of Indian country, while delivering a message of peace and remembrance with our neighboring communities here in Upstate New York," says Ray Halbritter, Oneida Indian Nation Representative.Native communities are also connecting and supporting each other online, with projects like theSocial Distance PowwowFacebook group, founded in March 2020 to "foster a space for community and cultural preservation." People from many different tribes share songs, dance videos, conversations, stories, and fundraisers and sell arts and crafts. It now has over 278,000 members.The sense of community and respect for elders were also behind American Indian and Alaska Native people being more willing to get vaccinated to protect their communities, says Jennifer Wolf, founder ofProject Mosaic, a consulting group for indigenous communities."We have so many reasons to be mistrustful of a government that has taken land away from us and broken so many promises," says Wolf, "and yet we have the highest (Covid-19) vaccination rates in the country."According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,half of all American Indian and Alaska Native people have been fully vaccinated, and 60% have received at least one dose, as compared to only 42% and 47% respectively of all whites.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Andrea HsuPassengers check bags for a Delta Air Lines, Inc. flight during the COVID-19 pandemic at Los Angeles International Airport.Patrick Fallon/AFP via Getty Imageshide captionPassengers check bags for a Delta Air Lines, Inc. flight during the COVID-19 pandemic at Los Angeles International Airport.As Covid cases surged over the summer, Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian took action: Unvaccinated workers would have to payan extra $200 a monthfor their health insurance, starting Nov. 1.It felt less onerous than the vaccine mandate imposed on workers by rivalUnited Airlines.But still, it was audacious.Around 75% of Delta's workforce had already received the Covid shots by that time. But each employee who was hospitalized with Covid had cost Delta $50,000, and Bastian noted in an August memo that none of those hospitalized in the summer surge had been fully vaccinated."This surcharge will be necessary to address the financial risk the decision to not vaccinate is creating for our company," he wrote.Now, as Covid cases climb once again, more companies are putting aside carrots and turning to sticks in an effort to protect their workers. From Utah grocery chain Harmons to Wall Street banking giant JPMorgan Chase, companies are telling their unvaccinated workers to get the shots or pay more for health insurance.In a September survey, the Society for Human Resource Management found less than 1% of organizations had raised health insurance premiums for unvaccinated workers and 13% have considered doing so.It was higher among large companies, where nearly 20% were considering the move.One employer is trying a different tactic. Mercyhealth, which has more than 7,000 employees at hospitals and clinics in Wisconsin and Illinois, introduced what it called a "risk pool fee," instead of higher health care premiums. Since mid-October, unvaccinated employees have had $60 deducted from their wages each month to go into this pool.In a memo to employees, Mercyhealth compared the fee to 16-year-old drivers having to pay more for auto insurance to cover the heightened risks they present as new drivers.Alen Brcic, Mercyhealth's vice president of people and culture, says $60 per month is a nominal amount, even symbolic. Mercyhealth still bears most of the costs when someone misses work or is hospitalized because of Covid.But after the policy was announced in September, the vaccination rate among the health system's employees rose to 91% from around 70%, according to Brcic."We really feel that this approach is working," Brcic says. "Truly, our goal is to encourage everyone to get vaccinated, but also ensure that people have the choice."A "couple of handfuls" of people quit over the policy and roughly 9% of employees are now contributing to the risk pool. Mercyhealth did provide a very small number of medical exemptions, but no religious exemptions.Brcic is not sure how thefederal vaccine mandate for health care workers, set to take effect Jan. 4, will affect the risk pool program."We are evaluating all options," he says.A sign outside Camden Yards in Baltimore, Maryland, encourages people to get a COVID-19 vaccine.Mitchell Layton/Getty Imageshide captionA sign outside Camden Yards in Baltimore, Maryland, encourages people to get a COVID-19 vaccine.Other employers, including Delta Air Lines, JPMorgan Chase and Harmons appear to be raising health care premiums for unvaccinated workers under something called a "wellness program."According to federal law, companies are allowed to charge employees different amounts for health care as long as they do it through a program designed to promote healthy behaviors and prevent disease.For example, a company may run a wellness program that encourages employees to accumulate a certain number of steps every day or sets targets for BMI, a measurement of body fat based on height and weight. There are also wellness programs aimed at preventing and curbing tobacco use."Your wellness program could simply be: I'm going to encourage all of my employees to get vaccinated, full stop," says Sabrina Corlette, founder and co-director of the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University.As part of these programs, companies can offer rewards or penalties for meeting certain targets, such as getting vaccinated. But they must not exceed 30% of the cost of the employee's health care plan, calculated as the amount paid by the employee and the employer combined. The maximum penalty rises to 50% for wellness programs targeting tobacco use."Most employers are doing this to try to have a healthier and more productive workforce... and to spend less on overall health care costs," says Corlette.Under federal law, the wellness program must be "reasonably designed," meaning there's a reasonable chance the program will improve the health of or prevent disease in the participants.To ensure that wellness programs do not violate discrimination laws, companies must provide waivers for individuals who have medical reasons for not meeting the stated targets or alternative ways for them to satisfy the requirements.As part of its policy, the Utah grocer Harmons says its insurance premium surcharge of up to $200 per month applies to "unvaccinated associates who don't qualify for an exemption or who chose not to complete a vaccine education series.""Over 86% of our associates are vaccinated, and we believe this and the other safety measures we have taken have kept our associates safe through the pandemic," a company statement read.Delta Air Lines would not say how many of  its 73,000 U.S.-based employees are paying the $200 monthly surcharge since it took effect Nov. 1. It did report that its vaccination rate saw a bump after the surcharge was announced and "has steadily climbed to 94%."Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Abigail CenskyKatarina SostaricA nurse fills a syringe with COVID-19 vaccine at a mass vaccination site in Kansas City, Mo. on March 19, 2021.Orlin Wagner/APhide captionA nurse fills a syringe with COVID-19 vaccine at a mass vaccination site in Kansas City, Mo. on March 19, 2021.Republican lawmakers across the country look determined to take on the Biden administration's insistence that employers require their workers to get vaccinated against COVID-19.The Kansas legislature meets in special session starting Monday to engage in battle with the federal government over the vaccine mandates. But courts will likely have the final say on whether the mandates are legal, and some worry such bold action could further atrophy the state's ability to respond to public health crises and could put employers in a legal quandary.Last week, the Occupational Safety and Health Administrationpaused enforcementof its own temporary emergency standardrequiringcompanies with 100 employees or more to mandate that workers either get vaccinated or submit to regular testing by Jan. 4, 2022.Now that the rule is in legal limbo, it's unlikely the Republicans who dominate the legislature in Kansas will abandon plans to give workers the freedom to dodge the mandates."We're not going to let the Biden Administration force businesses to play God or doctor and determine whether a religious or medical exemption is valid or not," Republican Senate President Ty Masterson said in a statement announcing the session. "We're going to trust individual Kansans."Kansas' drafted legislation mirrorsa new law passed in Iowa that expands an individual's ability to refuse the vaccineand keep their job — or, get unemployment benefits.Conservative lawmakers in Florida, Iowa, Kentucky, Tennessee, Wyoming andNorth Dakotahave already completed special sessions and passed bills aimed at nullifying new federal mandates.Lawmakers inFloridapassed a bill that would fine businesses $10,000 per violation if they didn't offer a number of exemptions to their employees. The governor inWyomingsigned only one of the 20 bills that were written during the special session — a law that gives his office $4 million dollars to challenge federal vaccine mandates.Thenew Iowa lawdirects employers to waive vaccine requirements for any workers who say they believe the vaccine would hurt their health or wellbeing or that of someone they live with, or if they say it would conflict with their religion. And they don't need to provide any proof. Five of the states, including Kansas and Iowa, will elect governors next year.State lawmakers in Kansas passed a bill earlier this year modifying the Kansas Emergency Management Act toshift power awayfrom local public health officials and the governor and toward elected county commissioners.Yet even if the federal mandate is struck down, new state laws making changes to religious exemptions in Kansas could transform the legal and public health systems for years to come."It seems like the bills are drafted to let the exemptions swallow the rule," says Sharon Brett, legal director of the Kansas chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union.Brett says there's no freedom of religion provision in the First Amendment that allows a person to put another person in danger by practicing their religion.If employers have incentives to skimp on verifying the sincerity of an employee who invokes a religious exemption, Brett says that would mark a fundamental change."It basically gives a two-tiered system of justice," Brett says, "where the religious rights of people in free society are upheld over public safety."New laws strengthening religious exemptions for COVID-19 vaccines could also wind up undercutting laws on the books requiring vaccinations for school-aged children."It sets a precedent," says Dr. Marcus Plescia, the chief medical officer for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials. "It's particularly concerning for childhood vaccinations."He cites previous national measles outbreaks where some people garnered religious exemptions and remained unvaccinated. In cases like that, Plescia says, public health officials have often been able to lobby religious leaders to convince them of the good vaccines would do in their communities.But in this case, he said some of these religious exemptions "aren't really something that religions themselves are even calling for."State and local health officials face this political and legal fight when they're already besieged by the pandemic. That's made it harder to campaign against new laws that could have far-reaching effects on a range of vaccinations."There's not a clear sort of national advocate who can step in," Plescia says.Meanwhile, he said groups like the conservative American Legislative Exchange Council have drafted model legislation adopted by legislatures across the country.In Iowa and Kansas, business groups are also opposed to the new legislation. The National Federation of Independent Businesses and the Kansas Chamber vocally opposed the legislation, and the Iowa Association of Business and Industry has said the vaccine waiver law is just an additional mandate that could make it especially difficult for Iowa companies to comply with the federal rules."Employers are in this rock and a hard place between the federal government and the state government kind of showdown," says Denise Hill, an attorney and Drake University professor who wrote a book about workplace vaccine mandates. "And so it's really a bad place to be for everyone."She says the courts will ultimately determine how the federal and state rules interact with each other.The Biden administrationhas issued three mandates. Companies with at least 100 employees have to require vaccination or weekly testing. Federal contractors and health care facilities have to require vaccination without a testing option."To my knowledge, there's nothing that tells an employer that they cannot take exemptions, [that] they cannot follow the Iowa law," says Republican Rep. Henry Stone, who managedthe bill's passagein the Iowa House of Representatives. "It shouldn't put them between a rock and a hard place."Stone says he has been hearing from business leaders who say the Iowa law is working.But Hill says the Iowa law hasmuch broader languagethan the typical employer-based vaccine mandate exemptions aimed at accommodating disabilities and sincerely-held religious beliefs."It really takes away the discretion from the employer," Hill says. "It says that they shall waive this. It doesn't say that they shall enter into an interactive accommodation discussion to see if they can waive them. And so that's really problematic. It does, I believe, conflict with what the federal requirements are."Hill said if the federal government doesn't accept Iowa's waivers, employers could face fines or lose their ability to do business with the government. If companies fire unvaccinated employees to follow the federal rules, they could be on the hook for paying for those workers' unemployment benefits under the new Iowa law.Iowa Gov. Kim Reynoldshas joined three multi-state lawsuitschallenging each of the federal vaccine mandates. The requirement for companies with at least 100 employeesis being blocked by a court, but it's not clear what will happen with that or the other two mandates."Don't assume the stay is going to stay in place," Hill says. "You need to get your ducks in a row to come into compliance."She says advisors and legal teams will have to help employers on a case-by-case basis."Does it do what's intended both in terms of allowing people to work around vaccine mandates of employers as well as kind of respond to what they think is an overreach by the federal government? And that, of course, will remain to be seen," Hill says.If the Iowa law does end up allowing a lot of people to avoid vaccine mandates, it could hurt efforts to end the coronavirus pandemic."If we don't have people actually get vaccinated, we're going to continue to have these pockets of people who aren't protected," says Dr. Christy Petersen, the director of the Center for Emerging Infectious Diseases at the University of Iowa. "Even if they have gotten sick ... the evidence is that they don't stay protected for very long. And we will just continue to go through cycles of illness and death within these groups."Petersen says workplace vaccine mandates have been effective and information from past vaccine campaigns shows that making it easier to get out of a mandate drives down vaccination rates, according to Petersen. She says exemptions for childhood vaccines have required getting a signature or showing some kind of proof."It turns out that that one extra step does make it so that people are less likely to try to use the exemption," Petersen says. "So any small hurdle does lead to more people getting vaccinated and providing greater protection across the state."Abigail Censkyis KCUR's politics and government reporter.Katarina Sostaricis Iowa Public Radio's state government reporter.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

Disney has paused its COVID-19 vaccine mandate to comply with a new Florida law.The U.S. is approaching its second Thanksgiving in the COVID-19 pandemic, and cases are rising again.The CDCreportedthat, as of Thursday, the seven-day daily average of new infections was 88,482, a 16.1% jump over the prior week.Public health experts say families that are fully vaccinated can enjoy a normal Thanksgiving together, and they're urging those who have not yet gotten the shot to do so.Here are some other coronavirus updates:Disney has paused its COVID-19 vaccine mandate for workers at Walt Disney World in Orlando, the company confirmed to NPR on Sunday.It comes after a new Florida lawsigned Thursday by Gov. Ron DeSantisthat bars employers from imposing COVID-19 vaccine mandates and gives employees the ability to select an exemption or opt for periodic testing or the use of personal protective equipment."Nobody should lose their job due to heavy-handed COVID mandates and we had a responsibility to protect the livelihoods of the people of Florida," DeSantis said.In a statement to NPR, a Disney spokesperson said the company believes its "approach to mandatory vaccines has been the right one as we've continued to focus on the safety and well-being of our Cast Members and Guests."More than 90% of Disney's Florida-based employees have verified that they're fully vaccinated, the company said.The head of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last weekendorsed COVID-19 booster shotsfor all adults who were fully vaccinated.But as to whether we'll need boosters of the coronavirus vaccine this frequently for the foreseeable future, experts say the jury is still out."We would hope — and this is something that we're looking at very carefully — that that third shot with the mRNA [vaccines] not only boosts you way up but increases the durability so that you will not necessarily need it every six months or a year," Dr. Anthony Fauci, chief medical adviser to the president for COVID-19,said on ABC'sThis WeekSunday morning."We're hoping it pushes it out more," he added. "If it doesn't, and the data show we do need it more often, then we'll do it."Fauci was also asked about the governors ofConnecticutandNew Mexicosaying that people are no longer considered fully vaccinated until they've gotten booster shots. He said the federal definition of fully vaccinated remains unchanged: two doses of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines or one dose of the Johnson & Johnson shot.Data from Johns Hopkins University appears to show that recorded deaths from COVID-19 in 2021 have surpassed those from 2020, even as the vaccine has been widely available for most of the year.As of Sunday, theJohns Hopkins COVID-19 data dashboardreported that there have been 771,045 total coronavirus deaths in the U.S. throughout the course of the pandemic.According to the CDC, 385,343 deaths occurred last year, which would mean that the remaining fatalities — 385,702 — happened in 2021.Butofficial CDC datahas not yet caught up with the university's tally. The agency said 382,861 people have died from COVID-19 in the U.S. so far this year.Johns Hopkinsgets its datadirectly from state and county health authorities.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

The disruption went on until around 1 a.m., and police took 19 people into custody before the night was over.That demonstration also ended with five officers injured, according tothe Associated Press. One officer suffered a knee injury as well as a concussion, and others sustained hearing damage, police said onTwitter.Other COVID-related protests also took place across the Netherlands on Saturday, including in the cities of Amsterdam, Breda, and Katwijk. In Alkmaar and Almelo, fans broke into two soccer games, defying recentlockdown orders, the AP reported.The night before,protestsbroke out in the Dutch city of Rotterdam with hundreds attending. Protestors are alleged to have thrown rocks at officers patrolling the scene in addition to setting off fireworks,according to local authorities. As events spiraled into disarray, authorities issued an emergency order and tried to clear the area with the use of a water cannon, officials said. Some in attendance are also alleged to have set fire to police cars and damaged property.The protests have come in response to a three-week partial lockdown announced last weekend following a spike in COVID-19 cases.Ahmed Aboutaleb, the mayor of Rotterdam, said that police "felt it necessary to draw their weapons to defend themselves," according to an Associated Pressreport. Three protestors were shot and are currently being treated at a hospital, police said in a statement. Authorities also claimed that they fired warning shots initially and that officers were also injured; one had to be hospitalized for a leg injury and another needed to be treated by a paramedic.Police arrested 51 people on Friday on charges that include public assault, incitement, and violation of the emergency order, and around half of those taken into custody were minors, authorities said.Friday's activities prompted criticism from Justice Minister Ferd Grapperhaus."The riots and extreme violence against police officers, riot police and firefighters last night in Rotterdam are disgusting to see," he said in a statement obtained by the Associated Press. He added, "Protesting is a great right in our society, but what we saw last night is simply criminal behavior. It has nothing to do with demonstrating."Thousands of protesters opposing the Pandemic Legislation being tabled in the Victorian Parliament are seen with placards and flags in Flagstaff Gardens on November 20, 2021 in Melbourne, Australia.Darrian Traynor/Getty Imageshide captionThousands of protesters opposing the Pandemic Legislation being tabled in the Victorian Parliament are seen with placards and flags in Flagstaff Gardens on November 20, 2021 in Melbourne, Australia.Protests in the Netherlands are reminiscent of what's occurring in numerous other countries across Europe in recent days. In Austria, citizens have been protesting the government's recentdecisionto impose a nation-wide lockdown beginning on Monday, as well as plans to make vaccinations compulsory in February.Thousands joined a demonstration in Vienna on Saturday, with around 35,000 people gathering in the city's Heroes' Square,The Guardianreports.Days earlier, hundreds of protestors had gathered outside the Austrian embassy in France, according toReuters. Meanwhile, on the island of Guadeloupe, a French territory, rioters have set fires in the streets, shot at police, destroyed property, and looted places of business, prompting French officials to deploy around 50 members of their special forces to help restore order on the island, according to an Al Jazeerareport.In Belgium, policeestimatedthat around 35,000 people gathered for a protest on Sunday near a train station in Brussels. Events turned hectic, however, with protestors throwing objects at officers and police resorting to using water cannons and tear gas on the crowd,Politicoreports. Italy and Croatia have also been the site of demonstrations regarding COVID restrictions, and in Melbourne, Australia, heated protests against vaccine mandates are entering their second day.Amid the backlash, some health officials are worried that many countries should brace themselves for even more COVID-related deaths. Dr. Hans Henri P. Kluge, the World Health Organization's regional director for Europe, said earlier this month that Europe and central Asia are again "at the epicenter" of the COVID-19 pandemic. He warned that failure to act could result in half a million deaths by early next year."We are at another critical point of pandemic resurgence. Europe is back at the epicentre of the pandemic, where we were 1 year ago," Kluge warned. "The difference today is that we know more and we can do more. We have more tools and means to mitigate and reduce the damage to our communities and society."Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

The Dutch city's mayor called it "an orgy of violence."Police said that two rioters were hospitalized after being hit by bullets and investigations were underway to establish if they were shot by police. The condition of the injured rioters was not disclosed.Officers arrested 51 people, about half of them minors, police said Saturday afternoon. One police officer was hospitalized with a leg injury sustained in the rioting, another was treated by ambulance staff and "countless" others suffered minor injuries.Mayor Ahmed Aboutaleb told reporters in the early hours of Saturday morning that "on a number of occasions the police felt it necessary to draw their weapons to defend themselves" as rioters ran rampage through the port city's central shopping district, setting fires and throwing rocks and fireworks at officers."They shot at protesters, people were injured," Aboutaleb said. He did not have details on the injuries. Police also fired warning shots.Police fired warning shots, injuring an unknown number of people, as riots broke out Friday night in downtown Rotterdam at a demonstration against plans by the government to restrict access for unvaccinated people to some venues.Media TV Rotterdam via APhide captionPolice fired warning shots, injuring an unknown number of people, as riots broke out Friday night in downtown Rotterdam at a demonstration against plans by the government to restrict access for unvaccinated people to some venues.Police combing through video footage from security cameras expect to make more arrests.Photos from the scene showed at least one police car in flames and another with a bicycle slammed through its windshield.Riot police and a water cannon restored calm after midnight.It was one of the worst outbreaks of violence in the Netherlands since coronavirus restrictions were first imposed last year. In January, rioters also attacked police and set fires on the streets of Rotterdam after a curfew came into force.Justice Minister Ferd Grapperhaus condemned the events."The riots and extreme violence against police officers, riot police and firefighters last night in Rotterdam are disgusting to see," he said in a statement."Protesting is a great right in our society, but what we saw last night is simply criminal behavior. It has nothing to do with demonstrating," he added.Police units from around the country raced to Rotterdam to help bring Friday night's situation under control. Local media reported that gangs of soccer hooligans were involved in the rioting.Video from social media shown on Dutch broadcaster NOS appeared to show one person being shot in Rotterdam, but there was no immediate word on what happened.Police said in a tweet that it was "still unclear how and by whom" that person was apparently shot.An independent investigation into the shootings by police was opened, as is the case whenever Dutch police use their weapons.The government has said it wants to introduce a law that would allow businesses to restrict the country's coronavirus pass system to only people who are fully vaccinated or have recovered from COVID-19 — that would exclude people who test negative.The country has seen record numbers of infections in recent days and a new partial lockdown came into force a week ago.Local political party Leefbaar Rotterdam condemned the violence in a tweet."The center of our beautiful city has this evening transformed into a war zone," it said. "Rotterdam is a city where you can disagree with things that happen but violence is never, never, the solution."Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

The recommendation also applies to people 18 and older in long-term care settings.For people at least 18 and younger than 50, the panel supported a policy that recommends they receive a booster based on their individual risks and benefits.An analysis from a CDC working group concluded that the balance of benefits and risks for a booster is clearest for older people. The group also noted that the latest data on myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart seen rarely after vaccination but most often in young men, is "reassuring to date."Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Rachel TreismanTennessee Gov. Bill Lee speaks to reporters Tuesday, Jan. 19, 2021, in Nashville, Tenn. He released a video on Wednesday inviting law enforcement officers from across the country to join the Tennessee Highway Patrol.Mark Humphrey/APhide captionTennessee Gov. Bill Lee speaks to reporters Tuesday, Jan. 19, 2021, in Nashville, Tenn. He released a video on Wednesday inviting law enforcement officers from across the country to join the Tennessee Highway Patrol.Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee has a pitch for law enforcement officers across the country, regardless of their COVID-19 vaccination status: Join the Tennessee Highway Patrol."Our force is one of the most professional in the country," hesaid in a videoreleased Wednesday. "And we won't get between you and your doctor."In his message, addressed to cops from New York to Los Angeles, the Republican governor said the state would even help cover moving expenses for those who join the force. He directed those interested to apply online."We believe that you would be a great fit for our state," he said, before outlining some of the reasons he believed the state would appeal to them. Those include its beauty, low cost of living, lack of income tax and full support of law enforcement."I'll work to make sure your freedoms are protected," he added. "We stand with our law enforcement, and we'll stand with you, too."The Tennessee Highway Patrol thanked Lee for his "strong support"in a tweet.Lee's message comes at a time when many public agencies are requiring their personnel to get vaccinated, andfacing pushback from police officersand the unions that represent them.That's despite the fact that COVID-19 is the leading cause of on-duty deaths for law enforcement officers in 2021, according to theOfficer Down Memorial Page. Some 280 officers died of the virus this year, more than five times the number of those who died by gunfire.Member station WPLNin Nashville reports that the state highway patrol has declined to require the vaccine.The highway patrol is also offering full benefits, a car, free uniforms and free training to qualified applicants, "including those who have to leave other departments because they haven't gotten the shot," WPLN adds.Tennessee isn't the first state to make this kind of offer.Last month,Florida Gov. Ron DeSantissaid he was trying to recruit out-of-state officers and sheriff's deputies who are at risk of losing their jobs for not getting vaccinated or disclosing their vaccination status. DeSantis, a Republican, told Fox News he hopes to sign legislation that would award a $5,000 bonus to any officer who relocates to Florida.This story originally appeared ontheMorning Editionlive blog.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Michaeleen DoucleffEach week, we answer frequently asked questions about life during the coronavirus crisis. If you have a question you'd like us to consider for a future post, email us atgoatsandsoda@npr.orgwith the subject line: "Weekly Coronavirus Questions." See an archive of our FAQshere.One of the most frightening aspects of COVID-19 now seems to be the potential that symptoms could linger after an infection. What is my risk of having long COVID-19 if I become infected? And does being vaccinated change that?Over the past year, a flurry of research has been published about long COVID-19. Dozens of these studies try to estimate the risk of having lingering symptoms months after a coronavirus infection.But when you look closely at the data, a huge inconsistency emerges: The estimates of the prevalence of long COVID-19 range wildly, from less than 5% to nearly 60% of total COVID-19 cases. So what's going on?"It can be really confusing, even to scientists," saysChristina Pagel, who directs the Clinical Operational Research Unit at University College London.One of the major problems is with this term "long COVID-19." What scientists, doctors and the media have been calling "long COVID-19" isn't just one disease or disorder. "It's looking like what has been grouped together as 'long COVID' is actually two or three different groups of disorders," Pagel says.Each one of those disorders may have a particular set of symptoms and causes. Some affect populations differently than others do or linger for a different period of time.Many of the early studies focused primarily on people who have been hospitalized with COVID-19. "Obviously, these people will have more severe illnesses," says geriatricianClaire Stevesat King's College London. Some people spend time in the intensive care unit or on a ventilator.With this severe illness comes a high risk of organ damage, either because of the virus itself or the body's response to fight it. "Some people may have respiratory scarring and a kind of fibrosis that comes from having had inflammation in the lungs," she says.Some people have inflammation in their heart muscle, called myocarditis. Some have inflammation in their blood vessels orbrain. "In some individuals, there's definite evidence of changes in the areas of the brain that are sensitive to smell," Steves says.This tissue damage and inflammation can cause a whole host of lingering symptoms, including a fast heart rate, severe fatigue, breathing problems and cognitive problems.And organ damage can take a long time to heal, no matter the cause of it. In fact, whenever a person is critically ill in the hospital, symptoms can linger, says primary care doctor and bioethicistZackary Bergerof Johns Hopkins University."It's well known that people take a long time to recover after a critical illness," Berger says. "So I think it's not surprising that people who end up in the ICU would take longer to recover."Studies have found that for people hospitalized with COVID-19, the risk of lingering symptoms six months after the disease is quite high, around 50%, Steves says.Manynews reportshave suggested that the risk of getting long COVID-19 after a mild or moderate infection appears similar to the risk after a severe case. Indeed, somestudieshave found that up to 60% of people report one or more lingering symptoms six months after catching the coronavirus, including fatigue, brain fog, difficulty breathing, chest pain, coughing, joint and muscle pain, abdominal symptoms, headaches and anxiety or depression.But many of these studies are missing what's known as a control group. That is, they don't take into account that these symptoms may be common in people who haven't had COVID-19 — or who have had other kinds of infections. In other words, scientists aren't sure whether these symptoms are linked specifically to COVID-19 or are typical for recovery from many infectious diseases that no one has paid attention to."There's this belief that you have an infectious disease, you get your treatment for it and you're finished with it. You go back to work and you're fine," Berger says. "But for a lot of people, being sick isn't like that."Take, for instance, a bout of pneumonia caused by bacteria. Antibiotics can end the infection. But then many people endure symptoms weeks later. "Half of the people have problems breathing a month after pneumonia," Berger says. "That's a lot of people, right?"The same goes for the flu. And a study,publishedin September, demonstrates this idea clearly. Researchers in England analyzed the electronic health records of nearly 400,000 people with either a confirmed flu or COVID-19 diagnosis. Then they looked to see who had lingering symptoms. Nearly 60% of people with COVID-19 had at least one symptom lasting six months, but nearly 40% of people with the flu also had at least one persisting symptom similar to those seen in people with COVID-19."Plenty of people have lingering symptoms after infectious diseases," Berger says. "I think that's something we need to realize."Thus, another type of "long COVID" may be people who take longer to recover from an infection, whether it's the flu, pneumonia or COVID-19. In other words, there may have been "long flu" or "long pneumonia" all along, but it simply went unappreciated.There's growing evidence that SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes the disease COVID-19, can sometimes trigger several post-viral syndromes, or diseases known to occur after an infection. These includechronic fatigue syndrome, also calledME/CFS, and a blood circulation disorder called postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS).For example, onestudy, which included 130 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, found that 13% of them met the criteria for ME/CFS six months after their diagnosis.Dr. Peter Roweat Johns Hopkins University has evidence that mild illness can also trigger this disease. "We have a small sample size, but in those [patients] in whom function remains impaired [six months] after COVID-19 infection ... all have met criteria for ME/CFS," he wrote in an email to NPR. "I am referring here to the patients who have prolonged symptoms after mild COVID infections, not the hospitalized group, or those with organ damage after more severe acute COVID-19."So after you take into account these other causes of so-called "long COVID," what's left is possibly a disorder that's specific to the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. "There's no standard definition for this syndrome yet," says infectious disease epidemiologistIra Longiniat the University of Florida. "It's a collection of symptoms, including shortness of breath, brain fog, fatigue, but also an issue with one particular organ or tissue, such as the heart or brain."This disorder could be tied to the virus invading an organ or tissue and persisting there, or some lingering inflammation left over from the body fighting off the virus, Longini says.It's not known yet exactly what percentage of people will have this collection of symptoms months after COVID-19, but Steves at King's College London says heranalysesfrom the U.K. indicate the risk is much lower in people who weren't hospitalized.She says the Office for National Statistics in the U.K. has the best estimate, right now, for the prevalence of these long-COVID-19 symptoms in this population. That data includes self-reporting from more than a million people with COVID-19 diagnoses."Generally speaking ... that data show that the rate of long COVID, more than 12 weeks after an infection, is just under 5% of people," Steves says.Given the enormous number of COVID-19 cases in the U.S. (and around the world), even a rate of 5% means that more than 2 million Americans (and nearly 13 million people globally) will be affected by this specific cluster of COVID-19 symptoms for at least several months (and even more will struggle with other post-viral problems).Luckily, Steves says, the percentage of people who have these lingering COVID-19 symptoms drops off drastically a year after the infection. "There are definitely individuals who still have symptoms for more than a year, even up to 18 months now," she says. "But there's a very small percentage of those individuals. Gradually most people are getting better. I see that in my clinic."Still though, because so many people are affected, health care workers need to be on the lookout for signs of any type of long COVID-19 — and keep an open mind about it, saysDr. Paddy Ssentongo, an epidemiologist at Pennsylvania State University. "Doctors have to listen to the patient. They tell you what's happening to them. They don't make up symptoms. Patients know best what's going on with their bodies."The best way to reduce your risk of any type of long COVID-19 is to reduce your risk of getting a severe case of COVID-19. And to do that, Steves says, being vaccinated is at the top of the list. She and her colleagues havefoundthat being vaccinated with two doses cuts the risk in half for having the COVID-specific cluster of symptoms after an infection.But the overall effect of the vaccine on your risk of any kind of long COVID-19 is much greater, says Longini, of the University of Florida. "The vaccine reduces the probability of an infection with illness by maybe 70%. So overall, the reduction in long COVID among vaccinated people is more like 80 or 90%."That just shows you the power of the COVID-19 vaccines," he adds. They protect not just against acute disease but also against the various types of chronic illnesses associated with the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Rae Ellen BichellFromLiceDoctors technician Linda Holmes checks the heads of everyone in the Marker family for lice, including preschooler Hudson. It cost more than $200 to get the four-person household checked — eyebrows and Dad's beard included.Rae Ellen Bichell/KHNhide captionLiceDoctors technician Linda Holmes checks the heads of everyone in the Marker family for lice, including preschooler Hudson. It cost more than $200 to get the four-person household checked — eyebrows and Dad's beard included.The Marker family opened their door on a recent evening in Parker, Colo., to a woman dressed in purple with a military attitude to cleanliness.Linda Holmes, who has worked as a technician with LiceDoctors for five years, came straight from her day job at a hospital after she got the call from a dispatcher that the Marker family needed her ASAP.According to those in the world of professional nitpicking,Pediculus humanus capitis,the much-despised head louse, has returned."It's definitely back," said Kelli Boswell, owner of Lice & Easy, a boutique where people in the Denver area can get deloused, a process that can range from minutes to hours depending on the method and the infestation. "It's a sign that things are coming back to normal."Colds and more serious bugs like respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, are also back. That may leave some to wonder: With all the COVID-19 prevention measures in place, how are kids sharing these things?Like the coronavirus, all these bugs depend on human sociability. Unfortunately, the measures that many reopened schools have taken to prevent the transmission of COVID-19 — masks, hand-washing, vaccination — do little to deter the spread of the head louse. However, physical distancing, such as spacing desks 3 feet apart, should be helping, if it's actually happening.Lice are, in theory, harder to spread than the SARS-CoV-2 virus because proximity alone isn't enough: They usually need head-to-head contact. If a kid gets lice, odds are it means that kid spent some quality time close enough to another kid for the parasite to make its move. (Researcherstend to agreethat transmission via inanimate objects like combs and hats is minimal.)The head louse is not known for its fortitude or athletic prowess. It's basically the couch potato of pests. Adults can't survive more thana day or twowithout snacking on blood. Their eggs can't hatch without the warmth of a human head, and will die within about a week if not in those cozy conditions. The bugs can't jump or fly — only crawl. The one thing going for the head louse is its highly specialized claws, evolved to grasp human hair.Professional delouser Linda Holmes' tools of choice for nitpicking her customers' heads are extra-virgin olive oil and a set of fine-toothed combs. Other methods involve tools that run the gamut from special gels to devices that heat the head at a temperature thought to kill louse eggs.Rae Ellen Bichell/KHNhide captionUnlike thebody louse, the head louse isn't known to spread disease. An infestation doesn't indicate anything about a person's hygiene. (In fact, the lore of delousers says that the bugs prefer clean hair because it's more grabbable.) And despite common misconceptions, they can colonize people of all ages, races and ethnicities.COVID-19 lockdowns were not great from a louse-world-domination standpoint. But the critters have been bonding with usfor tens of thousands of years. A little lockdown wasn't going to end the romance.Federico Galassi, a researcher with Argentina's Pest and Insecticide Research Center,found thatstrict, early COVID-19 lockdowns did, indeed, lead to a decline in head lice among kids in Buenos Aires, but the bugs came nowhere close to being eliminated. His study found prevalence dropped from about 70% to about 44%.And one thing is clear: When people shut their doors and hunkered down in early lockdowns, the lice were right there hunkered down with us. When SaLeah Snelling reopened the doors of her Lice Clinics of America salon in Boise, Idaho, in May, she said, "the cases of head lice were heavier than we've ever seen." And it wasn't just one or two people in the household with lice, but the entire household.Now, Galassi and American louse workers say, infestation rates are back to pre-lockdown norms, despite school COVID-19 protections.Nix, a brand of anti-louse products,publishesa mapthat claims lice are bad right now in Houston, most of Alabama and New Mexico, plus Tulsa, Okla. The map directs people to locations that carry its products since many parents use a DIY approach once they spy the critter on a child's head.Paris Marker washes olive oil out of her daughter's hair after LiceDoctors technician Linda Holmes finished combing through it, looking for lice and nits — the eggs of the parasitic insects. The Markers paid more than $200 for Holmes to check and delouse everyone in the four-person household in Parker, Colo.Rae Ellen Bichell/KHNhide captionParis Marker washes olive oil out of her daughter's hair after LiceDoctors technician Linda Holmes finished combing through it, looking for lice and nits — the eggs of the parasitic insects. The Markers paid more than $200 for Holmes to check and delouse everyone in the four-person household in Parker, Colo.Richard Pollack, chief scientific officer with pro-bono pest-identification serviceIdentifyUS, said most claims about louse prevalence are "marketing nonsense" from a largely unregulated industry focused on apparent infestations that often turn out to be just dandruff, glitter, hair spray, grass-dwellingspringtail insects, innocuous fungus or even cookie crumbs.It's possible that the recent increase in business for professional nitpickery suggests that people are now comfortable seeking help outside the home rather than it being a sign of a surge in the bugs.While little research exists to confirm whether there is a real rise in lice, Boswell, Pollack and even the National Association of School Nurses agree that the bugsaren't likely spreading in the classroombecause in-school louse transmission is considered rare.Instead, Boswell said, it's more likely that as other activities resumed — sleepovers, play dates, summer camp, family gatherings — the bugs prospered once more.Pollack once wrote in a presentation slide, "Head lice indicate that the child has friends."Preschoolers tend to get the infestations the most "because they're more cuddly," said Julia Wilson, co-owner of Rocky Mountain Lice Removal in Lafayette, Colo. But she has also noticed a rise among teenagers, which she ascribes to them taking selfies with pals."You say to them, 'Have you touched heads?' and the teenager's like 'No, never,'" said Wilson. "And then all of a sudden, they're literally taking a selfie photo with their friends."The Marker family isn't sure where third-grader Huntley's lice originated. Perhaps a close friend or her dance team? The Markers spent more than $200 to get the four-person household checked — eyebrows and Dad's beard included. Her dad and her preschool-age brother were free of nits. But Holmes did find a couple of nits on Huntley's mom, Paris."You can just burn my whole head right now," said Paris.After combing each head carefully, Holmes ended the session by hugging her customers goodbye, proof that she trusts her work.KHN(Kaiser Health News) is an editorially independent program ofKFF(Kaiser Family Foundation).Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Jane GreenhalghBarbara CampbellA health care worker fills a syringe with the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine.Lynne Sladky/APhide captionA health care worker fills a syringe with the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine.People 18 or older who are already considered fully vaccinated could soon be eligible to get a Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine booster shot.Modernaasked for that authorization on Wednesday, one day after Pfizer made its application.The Food and Drug Administration is expected to announce later this week that it will grant Emergency Use Authorization for all adults to get those extra shots.The boosters are already authorized for anyone 65 or older. The FDA also has authorized boosters for people 18 and over who had some reason to believe they were at risk for severe disease, either because of their job or because of some health condition.Earlier this month Pfizer indicated that it was seeking to expand that authorization to everyone 18 and older, based on data from a clinical trial showing that a booster improved vaccine efficacy for all adults. FDA appears to be convinced by the company's data that a booster should be valuable for all adults.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Andrea HsuPresident Biden promotes his administration's vaccine or testing requirements for workers at the Clayco construction site in Elk Grove Village, Ill., on Oct. 7.Nicholas Kamm/AFP via Getty Imageshide captionPresident Biden promotes his administration's vaccine or testing requirements for workers at the Clayco construction site in Elk Grove Village, Ill., on Oct. 7.The 6th Circuit Court of Appeals has won the lottery to hear legal challenges to the Biden administration's vaccine rule that affects some 84 million workers.Thelottery was announcedafter multiple lawsuits against the administration were filed in several federal appeals courts. In a process resembling a Powerball drawing, a dozen ping pong balls, each representing one court, were placed into a wooden drum on Tuesday. The winning ball was drawn in Washington, D.C., by a selector from a judicial panel that oversees multidistrict litigation.The Biden administration rule was formally issued on Nov. 5 by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. It requires employers with 100 or more workers to ensure their workers are vaccinated against COVID-19 or undergo weekly testing starting Jan. 4.Lawsuits challenging the rule came in quick succession. Within 10 days, 34 lawsuits were filed, covering all 12 regional circuit courts and giving each of those courts one entry into the lottery.The 6th Circuit Court of Appeals, based in Cincinnati, Ohio, is known to lean conservative, with most of its judges appointed by Republican presidents. Six were appointed by President Donald Trump and five were appointed by President George W. Bush, while a total of five were appointed by Democratic Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama.It will now be up to the 6th Circuit to decide whether to lift the stay issued by the 5th Circuit. A three-judge paneltemporarily blockedthe OSHA rule one day after it took effect and reaffirmed that decision last Friday, calling the rule "a one-size-fits-all sledgehammer that makes hardly any attempt to account for differences in workplaces (and workers).""All else equal, a 28 year-old trucker spending the bulk of his workday in the solitude of his cab is simply less vulnerable to COVID-19 than a 62 year-old prison janitor," wrote Judge Kurt D. Engelhardt. "Likewise, a naturally immune unvaccinated worker is presumably at less risk than an unvaccinated worker who has never had the virus."The OSHA rule does exempt workers whose jobs do not put them into contact with coworkers or customers, as well as those who work entirely outdoors.While a majority of the lawsuits seek to overturn the OSHA rule, several labor unions went the other way. They sued saying the rule does not go far enough to protect workers from COVID-19. The rule does not apply to employers with fewer than 100 workers.The union lawsuits were mostly filed in courts that either have a majority of judges appointed by Democratic presidents or are evenly split.The Biden administration has repeatedly asserted that it has the authority to act in an emergency to protect workers facing "grave danger" on the job. Administration officials frequently cite the high death toll from COVID-19 — now topping 760,000 in the U.S. alone. OSHA estimates the rule could save some 6,500 lives and prevent 250,000 hospitalizations over a six-month period.The White House is urging companies to prepare to comply withthe rule's requirements, which include a Dec. 6 deadline for employers to identify which workers are vaccinated or not,and to enforce a mask mandate.Even if the the 6th Circuit weighs in quickly, it's likely the decision will be appealed and the litigation could continue for some weeks and months.Ultimately, the case could wind up in the Supreme Court.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Will StoneAfter declining most of the fall, COVID-19 cases are rising again in many parts of the U.S.Valerie Macon/AFP via Getty Imageshide captionAfter declining most of the fall, COVID-19 cases are rising again in many parts of the U.S.It's a worrying sign for the U.S. ahead of the holiday travel season: coronavirus infections are rising in more than half of all states. Experts warn this could be the start of an extended winter surge.The rise is a turnaround after cases had steadily declined from mid September to late October. The country is now averaging more than 83,000 cases a day — about a 14% increase compared to a week ago, and 12% more than two weeks ago."I hate to say it, but I suspect we're at the start of a new winter surge," says Dr.George Rutherford, an epidemiologist at the University of California, San Francisco.Loading...Growing outbreaks in the Midwest and Northeast are most responsible for pushing up the national numbers, and that comes after many weeks of high case counts and stress on states in the Mountain West where some hospitals are dealing with crisis levels of patients."There are still large swaths of the country under-immunized and even among states that are relatively well-vaccinated, like Colorado, New Mexico, Minnesota and Vermont, we're seeing sustained transmission," says Rutherford.The uptick in cases hasn't yet translated into a national spike in new hospital admissions, which tend to trail a rise in infections by several weeks. However, the grim situation in some parts of the West and upper Midwest offers a concerning picture for other states where cases are now climbing."It's a marathon here," saysDr. Kencee Gravesat the University of Utah Hospital, in Salt Lake City, Utah, who describes her state, like much of the Mountain West, as stuck in a "high plateau of a surge" where hospitals not only have an ICU full of COVID-19 patients, but also many other kinds of sick patients who need care.Despite the concerning trends, the expectation among experts who model the pandemic's course is that a surge will not bring the same level of death and severe disease as last year."The vast majority of the population has some form of immunity," saysNicholas Reich, a biostatician at UMass Amherst who runsa COVID-19 forecasting model. "That feels really different about this moment — there are fewer people to infect."The growth in cases isn't unexpected, given the patchwork of COVID-19 immunity across the U.S., whereabout 60% of the populationis fully vaccinated.Americans are moving around like they were before the pandemic, mask wearing is low compared to last year, people are spending more time indoors because of cooler weather, and protection against infection, both from vaccinations and prior infection, is waning, saysAli Mokdad, professor of Health Metrics Sciences at the University of Washington's Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation."You put all of this together — and what you see in Europe where many countries with higher vaccination rates than the United States are seeing a surge — of course, it's going to happen," he says.And unlike last year, the U.S. has to contend with a much more contagious version of the virus "that makes it really hard to snuff out chains of transmission," not to mention "human nature, which is wanting us to get back to pre-pandemic life," says Reich at UMass Amherst.Just how bad the situation gets will come down to complex dynamics around immunity. Southern states endured a brutal wave over the summer and that may have built up enough immunity from infection to shield them from another big resurgence this winter. Areas that did not face the same kind of surge, in particular states in the northern half of the country, are now dealing with an increase, but many also have the benefit of higher vaccination coverage."The real question is, how big will it get and will it really be substantial? And my sense is in New England, it's going to hit a wall of vaccinated people," saysDr. Ashish Jha, dean of Brown University's School of Public Health."I think the Midwest and the Great Plains — which have lower vaccination rates but have not seen a big delta surge — they may very well end up seeing quite a few infections in the weeks and months ahead."Even if hospitals see fewer COVID-19 patients overall, it's already clear that many are less prepared to handle the demands of the pandemic compared to last year."Every hospital I have talked to in the last month has severe shortages of staff, especially nurses," says Dr. Bruce Siegel, president of America's Essential Hospitals, which represents hundreds of public hospitals in the U.S.At the University of Utah Hospital, Dr. Graves says their surge ICU was closed down because they couldn't staff it anymore, and last month patients were waiting on average between three to five hours for an ICU bed. "Our resources and our stamina are far less now than a year ago," she says.In the Southwest, hospitals are also dealing with packed ICUs.New Mexico has higher vaccination rates than many nearby states, but the state was forced to enact its crisis standards of care plan weeks ago. Some hospitals have activated those plans, but none have moved to the most extreme scenario of deciding who gets care and who doesn't, saysTroy Clark, president of the New Mexico Hospital Association.Starting in the spring, there was a "huge influx of patients that we don't normally see" with other urgent medical needs, Clark says. That has kept hospitals extremely busy heading into winter — and with no slack to accommodate the growing number of COVID-19 patients.It's a similar situation in many states, including Arizona where hospitalizations for COVID-19 are now as high as they've been since February. "We just don't have that extra capacity for a COVID spike," saysAnn-Marie Alameddin, president of the Arizona Hospital and Healthcare Association.The upper Midwest now has some of the highest cases per capita in the country. Hospitals leaders in Minnesota are imploring people to take caution so they don't require medical care for COVID or non-COVID emergencies. "This has never been more serious,"saidKelly Chandler of Itasca County Public Health, which includes the city of Grand Rapids, in a recent public statement. "We are at crisis levels of 2020, but without the same levels of COVID precautions in place."As we head into the holidays, COVID risk increases, with more people traveling and socializing indoors. But "we also have some things that are helping, like more vaccines and kids getting vaccinated," says Brown's Jha. "So we're in a stalemate. I don't expect us to have a horrible surge, but I can certainly imagine parts of the country that see modest-sized surges as people get together and as the weather stays cold."NPR's Rob Stein contributed to this report.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

Nearly 12,000 people have died since the start of the coronavirus pandemic in the country of 9 million.As Germany battles its worst infection rate since the pandemic began, a similar lockdown has been imposed in the capital, Berlin, with only people who are fully vaccinated or who recently recovered from COVID-19 allowed to enter restaurants, cinemas and sports facilities.The federal government is alsoreversing courseonly a month after saying it would no longer provide free coronavirus testing.While Germany, at 68%, and Austria, at 65%, outpace the U.S. in the percentage of thepopulation fully vaccinated, they are somewhat behind some of their fellow EU members, as well as the United Kingdom."Our vaccination rate is still under 75% of the German population," said Dr. Christine Falk, president of the German Society for Immunology, according toDeutsche Welle. "Combined with the lack of contact restrictions, this is allowing the virus to spread almost exclusively among the unvaccinated."Germany has recorded about 98,000 COVID-19 deaths since the start of the pandemic.Meanwhile, the Netherlands on Saturday night imposed a partial lockdown that is set to remain in place for at least three weeks, amid a surge in COVID-19 cases that have put a severe strain on Dutch hospitals.The measures will limit hours for bars, restaurants and supermarkets. There is also a limit of four guests per household, and spectators are once again banned from sporting events.The measures, announced by acting Prime Minister Mark Rutte on Friday, angered some Dutch youth, hundreds of whom took to the streets on Saturday night in the northern city of Leeuwarden, where they set off fireworks before being pushed out of a central square by police, broadcaster NOS reported, according toThe Associated Press.Despite a vaccination rate of nearly 85% of the adult population in the Netherlands, the country recorded a record number of new infections on Thursday — more than 16,000.COVID-19 has killed more than 18,600 people in the country since the start of the pandemic.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Scott NeumanVaccine mandate protestors perform a haka last week in Wellington, New Zealand.Hagen Hopkins/Getty Imageshide captionVaccine mandate protestors perform a haka last week in Wellington, New Zealand.A New Zealand Māori tribe has demanded that anti-vaccine mandate advocates stop using its ceremonial dance, the "Ka Mate" haka, at protests.The dance, which was traditionally performed before battle and is meant to show tribal pride and unity, is an intimidating display of chanting, foot-stamping, tongue protrusions and rhythmic body slapping. It has been popularized by New Zealand's All Blacks rugby team, which performs it before the start of every test match.The Ngati Toa, whichwon legal controlof the Ka Mate — the tribe's unique version of the haka — in 2009, strongly objected on Monday after demonstrators were seen performing it at recent rallies.Taku Parai, a tribal leader, called on the protesters to stop using the Ka Mate "immediately.""We do not support their position and we do not want our [tribe] associated with their messages," he said, according to theNew Zealand Herald.Last week, thousands of people, some waving Trump flags, marched or rode motorcycles to New Zealand's Parliament to protest a government mandate for doctors, pharmacists, nurses and other health care workers to be fully vaccinated by December, theSydney Morning Heraldreports. Teachers and other education workers have until January to get vaccinated, according to the mandate.Brian Tamaki, the leader of the fundamentalist Destiny Church in New Zealand and a right-wing activist, has been a prominent figure in the anti-vaccine movement in the country.Tamaki, himself a member of two Māori tribes, was reportedly planning to teach the Ka Mate haka to protesters for use at future demonstrations, according toRadio New Zealand."Our message to protesters who wish to use Ka Mate is to use a different haka," Modlik said.Vaccination rates among Māori people are below New Zealand's national averages, with just 61% fully vaccinated, according togovernment data.Some Māori leaders have criticized the government's decision to end lockdowns, with the co-leader of New Zealand's Māori Party, Debbie Ngarewa-Packer, calling that move a"death warrant"for Indigenous communities."Many of our [ancestors] lost their lives in previous pandemics," the tribe's chief executive Helmut Modlik said in a statement."We are absolutely clear that the COVID-19 vaccine is the best protection we have available to us," Modlik said, adding that the Ngati Toa "are committed to supporting" vaccination of its people "as soon as possible."Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

On Friday, the government eased many remaining pandemic restrictions.WASHINGTON — The government on Friday directed nursing homes to open their doors wide to visitors, easing many remaining pandemic restrictions while urging residents, families and facility staff to keep their guard up against outbreaks.Thenew guidance from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Servicesinstructs nursing homes to allow visits at all times for all residents. Facilities will no longer be able to limit the frequency and length of visits, or require advance scheduling. Although large groups of visitors are discouraged, nursing homes won't be allowed to limit the number of loved ones and friends who can pay a call on residents.Many states and communities are still grappling with COVID-19 surges driven by the aggressive delta variant, but themost recent government datashow that cases among residents and staff have continued to decline after rising earlier in the summer and fall.Nationally, vaccination rates average 86% for nursing home residents and 74% for staff, although that can vary dramatically from state to state and facility to facility. Many nursing homes are rushing to provide booster shots for their residents. Staffers were recently required by the government to get vaccinated.This "gets us the closest to pre-pandemic visitation that we've ever been since the beginning of the pandemic," said Jodi Eyigor, director of nursing home quality and policy for LeadingAge, an industry group that represents nonprofit facilities."But it doesn't mean that the pandemic is over and that COVID is not circulating," Eyigor added. "The nursing homes, the residents and their loved ones are all going to have to work together to make sure that visits are occurring and they are occurring safely."The federal guidance draws a line on visits by people who have tested positive for COVID or meet the criteria for quarantine. Nursing homes should not allow COVID-positive visitors to enter.But residents can still receive visits if their facility is in the midst of an outbreak investigation or if they themselves are under special precautions to prevent COVID transmission. In such cases, residents and visitors must wear masks and protective gear.It was unclear Friday how the new federal guidance would work with local and state requirements that may be more restrictive.People in long-term care facilities have borne a cruel toll from the pandemic. They represent about 1% of the U.S. population, but accounted for roughly in 3 in 10 deaths. The ravages of COVID were compounded by enforced isolation. Nursing homes went on lockdown in March of last year and residents were unable to see their loved ones in person until early this spring.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

Lindsay was the first person known to receive a COVID vaccine in the United States vaccination campaign — on Dec. 14, 2020. Her vaccination card is displayed at the COVID-19 exhibit in the Smithsonian Museum of American History.With more Americans getting COVID-19 boosters these days than first shots and many more potentially becoming eligible as the FDA is currently considering Pfizer's request to approve its booster for the general population, the number of people enjoying boosted vaccine status is skyrocketing.But what does that new status buy you, exactly? We spoke toCharlotte Baker, assistant professor of epidemiology at Virginia Tech, andAbraar Karan, an infectious disease doctor at Stanford University, to find out.What a booster means, they say, is that you've got your best layer of protection — your vaccine — back in prime condition. Recent research has shown that vaccines wane after time (for example, a recent study found Pfizer dropped from 90% effective at preventing symptomatic infection initially to 70% after five months), but  that boosters work well at increasing your antibody protection. (Note that you still must wait until after that 2-week point waiting period — just like the first time around, our experts stress, your new jab won't reach peak effectiveness until about two weeks later.)But even after that, Baker and Karan urge you to keep your stash of masks. And definitely do not stopwashing your hands! With cold and flu season ramping up, wearing a mask when you're out and about can protect you from a variety of germs. In fact, after your booster, you may be more at risk of catching a cold or flu than COVID-19."It's still the same precautions, but the fact is that you have just improved your immunity," Baker says. "So if you're somebody who is not really high risk, you can feel a little bit better about your chances of contracting COVID."More good news: There's no reason to stay in lockdown mode, Baker says. If you're booster-protected and healthy enough that the flu wouldn't present a grave risk and raring to go out, go for it."If you're thinking, 'OK, I kinda wanna start to get back out there in the world a little bit.' I don't see a problem with that," Baker says.While that may not sound like a ringing endorsement, even Baker herself, who has been extremely cautious during the pandemic, booked a reservation for dinner recently. Depending on your level of risk tolerance, you can look for restaurants that are taking precautions such as physical distancing, patio dining, mask requirements when not actively eating. Or avoid crowds by going during off-peak hours, she suggests.You can take similar precautions at gyms and movie theaters; going at off-peak times can make an especially big difference in the number of people – and the level of risk."The bottom line is, we're not in lockdown anymore," she says. And your mental health needs are important, too, especially if you've already spent significant portions of the pandemic separated from loved ones. "If you wanna go out, go out. Just be safe about it."That also means staying on top of local data, she and Karan point out."If you have low rates of spread [in your area] and are fully boosted, I think you can consider it unlikely that you'll get COVID-19, Karan says. "If the rates are high, then of course there's still a chance ... but you'll be exceedingly unlikely to get severe disease."(For help weighing your risks,refer to our questionnaire.)If you do find out you've come in contact with someone who turned out to be infected, people with boosters should follow the same CDC guidance they did before: Get tested five to seven days after the exposure.Ready to roll up your sleeve again? You may not have long to wait: Boosters for all vaccinated Americans 18 and older may be here by Thanksgiving.Sheila Mulrooney Eldred is a freelance health journalist in Minneapolis.

Scott NeumanA vaccination center worker inoculates a woman with the Biontech vaccine against Covid-19 in Lower Saxony.Moritz Frankenber/dpa/picture alliance via Getty Ihide captionA vaccination center worker inoculates a woman with the Biontech vaccine against Covid-19 in Lower Saxony.Another wave of COVID-19 is sweeping across Europe, setting new records in some countries.Records for daily infections have been shattered in recent days in Germany, the Netherlands and Austria. While deaths from COVID-19 are way down from last year in many European countries, Russia — with barely a third of its population vaccinated — has seen a steady two-month surge and nowleads the world in total coronavirus deathsfor the first time since the start of the pandemic.The Netherlands' government announced Friday the country will return to a partial lockdown starting Saturday in an effort to slow the spread of coronavirus cases.The World Health Organization'sCOVID-19 reportfor the week ending Nov. 7 showed that Europe, including Russia, was the only region with a rise in deaths from the virus, up 10%. Overall, new coronavirus cases were on the decline in most of the world, but were up 7% in Europe and 3% in Africa.Last week, the WHO's director for Europe, Dr. Hans Kluge,said the region"is back at the epicenter of the pandemic — where we were one year ago."A virologist at Warwick Medical School in the U.K., Lawrence Young, toldReutersthat the latest surge is yet another hard lesson for Europe. "If there's one thing to learn from this it's not to take your eye off the ball," he said.Vaccine hesitancy, waning immunity among the already inoculated and relaxed restrictions are all considered factors in the new wave, according to Reuters.Russian President Vladimir Putin hasblamed the surge in new cases and deathsin there squarely on hesitancy, saying he can't understand why Russians are reluctant to get the country's Sputnik V vaccine.In Germany, where cases on Thursday surged to anew recordof more than 50,000, the country's health minister, Jens Spahn, has said his country must do "everything necessary" to break the latest wave of the disease,Deutsche Welle reported."The situation is serious and I recommend that everyone takes it as such," he said. Spahn and the head of Germany's Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases, Lothar Wieler, warned that intensive care units across the country were under severe strain from COVID-19 patients, particularly in the states of Saxony, Thuringia and Bavaria.Spahn said free COVID-19 tests will be offered again starting Saturday.Olaf Scholz, likely to succeed Angela Merkel as Germany's next chancellor,has called on people either to be vaccinated, recovered or have negative tests to go to work and for stricter rules to enter restaurants and cinemas.Nearly a third of Germany's population is not yet fully vaccinated, according to data fromJohns Hopkins University.By contrast, Portugal and Spain — where new cases have been minimal — top the European vaccination statistics, with rates in excess of 80%. Infections are also low in France, which has kept restrictions in place since summer, including a requirement to show a vaccine passport to do nearly everything.Austria — which has a vaccination rate similar to Germany's and has also posted record infections in the past week — appears to be days away from imposing a lockdown for anyone who is not fully inoculated.Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg has called a national lockdown for the unvaccinated "probably inevitable," adding that two-thirds of the population should not have to suffer because the other third refused to be vaccinated.If the federal government approves, Upper Austria will impose restrictions on the unvaccinated beginning Monday. Salzburg is considering similar measures.Schallenberg said the unvaccinated face an "uncomfortable" winter and Christmas.In the Netherlands, a three-week partial lockdown was announced Friday, Reutersreported.During anews conferenceFriday, caretaker Prime Minister Mark Rutte said the country will return to a partial lockdown starting Saturday — ordering all bars and restaurants to close at 8 p.m. and sporting events to be held without audiences.Dutch government officials also recommended that no more than four visitors be allowed in people's homes.Denmark, which has also seen a recent upswing in cases, this week ordered its people to present a pass in the form of a smartphone app when they enter bars, restaurants and other public places. It is also considering fast-track legislation to require a digital "corona pass" for employers, according to Reuters.While the United Kingdom saw a similar increase in cases last month, there aresigns of a leveling offsince then.NPR's Jonathan Franklin contributed to this report.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Rob SteinKelly LaDue thought she was done with COVID-19 in the fall of 2020after being tormented by the virus for a miserable couple of weeks."And then I started with really bad heart-racing with any exertion. It was weird," says LaDue, 54, of Ontario, N.Y. "Walking up the stairs, I'd have to sit down and rest. And I was short of breath. I had to rest after everything I did."A year later, LaDue still feels like a wreck. She gets bad headaches and wakes up with pain all over her body on more days than not. She also experiences a sudden high-pitched whistling in her ears, bizarre phantom smells and vibrations in her legs. Her brain is so foggy most of the time that she had to quit her job as a nurse and is afraid to drive."These symptoms, they come and go," she says. "You think: 'It's gone.' You think: 'This is it. I'm getting better.' And then it'll just rear back up again."Kelly LaDue, of Ontario, N.Y., was working as a nurse when she got COVID-19 and recovered. But a year later, she's still grappling with a strange constellation of symptoms.Kelly LaDuehide captionKelly LaDue, of Ontario, N.Y., was working as a nurse when she got COVID-19 and recovered. But a year later, she's still grappling with a strange constellation of symptoms.Patients like LaDue have researchers scrambling to figure out why some people experience persistent, often debilitating symptoms after catching SARS-CoV-2. It remains unclear how often it occurs. But if only a small fraction of the hundreds of millions of people who've had COVID-19 are left struggling with long-term health problems, it's a major public health problem."I think it's the post-pandemic pandemic," says Dr.Angela Cheung, who's studying long COVID-19 at the University of Toronto. "If we are conservative and think that only 10% of patients who develop COVID-19 would get long COVID, that's a huge number."So far there are more theories than clear answers for what's going on, and there is good reason to think the varied constellation of symptoms could have different causes in different people. Maybe, in some, the virus is still hiding in the body somewhere, directly damaging nerves or other parts of the body. Maybe the chronic presence of the virus, or remnants of the virus, keeps the immune system kind of simmering at a low boil, causing the symptoms. Maybe the virus is gone but left the immune system out of whack, so it's now attacking the body. Or maybe there's another cause."It's still early days. But we believe that long COVID is not caused by one thing. That there are multiple diseases that are happening," saysAkiko Iwasaki, a professor of immunobiology at Yale University who is also studying long COVID-19.But Iwasaki and others have started finding some tantalizing clues in the blood of some patients. Those include unusual levels of cytokines, which are chemical messengers that the immune system uses to communicate, as well as proteins produced by the immune system known asautoantibodies, which attack cells and tissues in the body instead of the virus."We are finding elevated cytokines in long-COVID patients and we're trying to decode what those cytokines mean. We're also seeing some distinct autoantibody reactivity and are trying to find out what those antibodies are doing and whether they are causing harm," Iwasaki says.Other researchers have produced similar findings. Dr.Steven Deeksat the University of California, San Francisco, found long-COVID-19 patients appear to haveelevated levels of a cytokine called interleukin-6, suggesting they may be suffering from a state of chronic inflammation."The first couple of weeks of the infection is associated with a massive amount of inflammation. The virus just blows up the immune system," Deeks says. "So it's reasonable to think that, in some people, the acute COVID results in an inflammatory state that can contribute to long COVID over time."Yet another clue found in one subgroup of patients isan unusual pattern of activity by key immune system cells, such as as T-cells, which may support the idea that the virus is hiding in the body."That's a signature or pattern which could be consistent with a low-level, but persistent, infection in the long-COVID syndrome patient," says Dr.Igor Koralnikat Northwestern Feinberg School of Medicine.While much more research is needed, the researchers hope these findings could eventually lead to ways to help long-COVID patients. One possible therapy for some patients might turn out to be anti-viral drugs that target a virus hiding in the body. Another possibility might beclearing the virus with a vaccine, which does seem to help some long-COVID patients. Researchers think drugs that dampen down the immune system may also help."We need to understand what's going on in each patient — because the treatment option will be very different depending on what they actually have," Iwasaki says.But others are not so sure that any of the evidence produced so far linking subtle changes in lab tests to physical problems in long-COVID-19 patients is very convincing. That includes any signs that the immune system is the problem — what's known as an autoimmune disease."The thing that has struck me most now in a year and a half of seeing these patients and extensively testing them is that we are finding little to no abnormalities," saysDr. Michael Sneller, who has been conducting a battery of detailed tests on hundreds of long-COVID-19 patients at the National Institutes of Health."Echocardiogram, pulmonary function tests, X-rays, brain MRIs. You name it. Laboratory markers of organ dysfunction. We're not seeing any of that," Sneller says of the patients in his study. "And precious little evidence of immune activation, looking just at the sort of standard markers of inflammation. I'm running out of tests to do basically."But Sneller says his team hasn't ruled out anything and is continuing to analyze data about the immune system. His team is also conducting psychological testing on their study's subjects — though not because he doubts their symptoms."It's 100% real. These people have these symptoms. Absolutely. The question is what's causing them," he says. "Anxiety can produce real symptoms."For her part, LaDue hopes researchers eventually figure out what's going with her and other patients."I want to feel normal, and I hope to be back to normal again someday," she says. "The hardest part, definitely, is trying to look and be normal — but not feeling normal."Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

Toyota produced about 7.6 million units in the previous fiscal year."We would like to express our gratitude to all parties concerned for their immense support in helping us maintain production," Toyotasaid in a statement.Automakers have recentlystruggled to make enough vehiclesin the face of a parts shortage, particularly semiconductors. Meanwhile, soaring demand has driven prices up at the dealership.All of Toyota's 14 plants and 28 production lines in Japan will be operating normally for the first time since May, the company announced, further helping it rev up production.Still, the company said it was responding to a continuing shortage of some parts by attempting to shore up its supply chain.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Jonathan FranklinPresident Biden speaks about COVID-19 vaccinations in Elk Grove Village, Ill. Ten states are filing a lawsuit over the administration's rule requiring health care workers to be vaccinated.Susan Walsh/APhide captionPresident Biden speaks about COVID-19 vaccinations in Elk Grove Village, Ill. Ten states are filing a lawsuit over the administration's rule requiring health care workers to be vaccinated.A group of 10 states hasfiled a lawsuitagainst the Biden administration and its requirement that health care workers in the U.S. to be vaccinated against COVID-19, saying the mandate is "unconstitutional and unlawful."Led by Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt and Nebraska Attorney General Doug Peterson, the 10 states say the mandatory nationwide vaccine requirement will lead to shortages of health care workers and could threaten the jobs of "millions of health care workers" who risked their lives during the beginning stages of the pandemic.In addition to Missouri and Nebraska, attorneys general from Arkansas, Kansas, Iowa, Wyoming, Alaska, South Dakota, North Dakota and New Hampshire also joined the lawsuit."Unfortunately, with this latest mandate from the Biden Administration, last year's healthcare heroes are turning into this year's unemployed. Requiring healthcare workers to get a vaccination or face termination is unconstitutional and unlawful, and could exacerbate healthcare staffing shortages to the point of collapse, especially in Missouri's rural areas," Schmitt said in anews release.He says his office has been challenging the Biden administration's "illegal edicts" and this is the latest."This case illustrates why the police power over compulsory vaccination has always been the province of — and still properly belongs to — the States," the attorneys general argued in their lawsuit.The 58-page lawsuit argues the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services vaccine mandate is intruding on states' police power, saying it's a violation of several acts and rights, including the Administrative Procedures Act, the Social Security Act, the Tenth Amendment and federalism."By ignoring the facts on the ground and unreasonably dismissing concerns about workforce short­ages, the CMS vaccine mandate jeopardizes the healthcare interests of rural Americans," the lawsuit says.In September, President Bidenunveiled a series of stepsto combat the surge of COVID-19 cases in the country, announcing that 17 million health care workers at hospitals and elsewhere that receive Medicare or Medicaid funding would have to be vaccinated.Last week, CMS issued aninterim final rulerequiring COVID-19 vaccinations for health care workers in most settings — such as hospitals and health systems — that participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.The new requirements, which went into effect Nov. 5, will apply to approximately 76,000 providers.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

California Department of Public Health officials say that no fully vaccinated adult should be denied a COVID-19 booster shot in the state.All fully vaccinated adults in California seeking a COVID-19 booster shot should be eligible to get one, California Department of Public Health officials say.In aletterThursday, officials directed health care providers not to deny booster shots to adult patients. The announcement opened up booster shot eligibility to millions of residents across the state."Do not turn a patient away who is requesting a booster," California Department of Public Health Director Tomás J. Aragón said in the letter. "Allow patients to self-determine their risk of exposure."People in California who are 18 and older are eligible for a COVID booster shot as long as at least six months have passed their second dose of the two-shot Pfizer or Moderna vaccine or two months must have passed since their Johnson & Johnson shot.The Centers for Disease Control and Preventionrecommendsthat any adult who is 65 or older who has received any of the three vaccines should get a booster shot. It only recommends boosters for people who are 18 and older if they live or work in long-term or high-risk settings or have an underlying health condition."These recommendations are another example of our fundamental commitment to protect as many people as possible from COVID-19," CDC Director Rochelle P. Walensky said in a statement regarding booster shot eligibility.According to theagency, less than 40% of fully vaccinated adults 65 and older in California have received a booster shot. And among all fully vaccinated adults 18 and older in the state, nearly 14% have received a booster shot."If you think you will benefit from getting a booster shot, I encourage you to go out and get it," said Dr. Mark Ghaly, secretary of the California Health and Human Services Agency in anews conferenceWednesday.Colorado also has expanded eligibility. Gov. Jared Polis signed anexecutive orderThursday allowing all adults in the state to get a COVID-19 booster shot."The health and safety of Coloradans has been my top priority throughout this global pandemic. We want to ensure that Coloradans have every tool they need to protect themselves from this deadly virus and to help reduce the stress on our hospitals and health care workers," Polis said in a statement.Dr. Eric France, CDPHE Chief Medical Officer, is urging Coloradans age 18+ to get a COVID vaccine booster dose six months after receiving either Pfizer or Moderna and two months after receiving the J&J vaccine. 1 in 48 Coloradans is estimated to be infectious.pic.twitter.com/K1RJHhTrnMEarlier this week, Colorado officials issued apublic health orderpreventing any vaccine provider from refusing a COVID-19 vaccine booster shot to anyone who meets the qualifications.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

Dave MistichFILE - This Thursday, Aug. 2, 2018, file photo shows the U.S. Food and Drug Administration building behind FDA logos at a bus stop on the agency's campus in Silver Spring, Md.Jacquelyn Martin/APhide captionFILE - This Thursday, Aug. 2, 2018, file photo shows the U.S. Food and Drug Administration building behind FDA logos at a bus stop on the agency's campus in Silver Spring, Md.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration hasannounceda recall of about 2 million at-home COVID-19 test kits made by the Australian-based biotech company Ellume.The federal regulatory agency says the test kits may produce "false positives" due to a manufacturing defect. The company first informed the FDA about the defect in some lots in October.On Wednesday, the FDA said it had identified additional lots that have been affected by the manufacturing defect. The defective tests were manufactured by Ellume between Feb. 24, 2021 and Aug. 11, 2021. So far, 35 false positives from these tests have been reported to the FDA.The FDA described the recall of the Ellume tests as "the most serious type," known as a Class I recall.Earlier this year,the Biden administration cut a $231.8 million dealwith Ellume to boost the availability of the tests in the U.S. market. Ellume's contract with the Department of Defense and Department of Health and Human Services helped fund the company's first plant in the country, which opened in Frederick, Maryland in May.The over-the-counter nasal swab tests can be purchased at a pharmacy or grocery store and taken at home. At-home kits — like the ones from Ellume — detect small parts of the virus that causes COVID-19and have been thought to provide fairly reliable results in about 15 minutes, especially in people who are symptomatic.The FDA and Ellume say that the reliability of negative results has not been affected by the issue found in the defective tests. Ina statementposted to the company's website, founder and CEO Dr. Sean Parsons apologized to those who had received a false positive."[W]e understand that trust is central to fulfilling our purpose as a company, and we recognize that this incident may have shaken the confidence of some of those who trusted Ellume to help them manage their health and to take back a bit of control of their lives during this pandemic," Parsons said.Ellume says it has corrected the manufacturing problem and federal regulators say they are monitoring the company's efforts moving forward."The FDA is continuing to work with Ellume to assess the company's corrective actions, such as additional manufacturing checks and other corrective steps, to address the reason for the manufacturing issue, and to help ensure that it is resolved and will not recur," the regulatory agency said in a statement.Over-the-counter at-home test kits have gained popularity as the pandemic has stretched on and as federal regulators have granted emergency authorization to tests from a whole host of companies.In March, the FDAannounced plans to streamline the authorization processfor at-home tests. The agencyupdated that processin October.Also last month,the White House announcedan additional allocation of $1 billion for at-home tests to ease an ongoing national shortage.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

Greg Abbott removes his mask before speaking at a news conference on in Dallas.LM Otero/APhide captionIn in this March 17, 2021 file photo, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott removes his mask before speaking at a news conference on in Dallas.A federal judge has ordered a halt to Texas'efforts to ban mask mandatesin state schools.U.S. District CourtJudge Lee Yeakel ruled in Austinthat the ban ordered by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott violated a federal law protecting disabled students' access to public education.Wednesday's ruling comes as the United States is seeing anotherupward trend of coronavirus casesin many states. The Texas ruling could have implications for other states with similar bans in place.In early August — just days after Abbott issuedan executive orderimposing the ban — the nonprofit advocacy group Disabled Rights Texas filed suit against the state and top officials, arguing the measure prohibited accommodations for disabled children who are particularly vulnerable to the effects of COVID-19.Yeakel spoke directly to that segment of students in his ruling."The spread of COVID-19 poses an even greater risk for children with special health needs," he wrote. "Children with certain underlying conditions who contract COVID-19 are more likely to experience severe acute biological effects and to require admission to a hospital and the hospital's intensive-care unit."Abbott, Republican state Attorney General Ken Paxton, the Texas Educational Agency and its commissioner, Mike Morath, were all named as defendants in the suit.Yeakel also noted in the ruling that more than 211,000 Texas students had tested positive for COVID-19 between the beginning of the 2021-22 school year and Oct. 31  At least 45 districts in the state have temporarily shut down because of outbreaks among students and staff.Under Yeakel's ruling, Paxton will be prohibited from imposing fines, withholding educational funding or suing school districts that require students to wear masks as a safety measure. Paxton had already sued 15 school districts to overturn local mask mandates those districts had imposed."We are thankful that school districts can now take the steps necessary to protect these students," said Kym Davis Rogers, litigation attorney at Disability Rights Texas in a statement posted to the organization's website. "No student should be forced to make the choice of forfeiting their education or risking their health, and now they won't have to."Paxton's office tweetedWednesday night that he would pursue an appeal to Yeakel's decision."I strongly disagree with Judge Yeakel's opinion barring my office from giving effect to GA-38, which prohibits mask mandates imposed by government entities like school districts," Paxton wrote. "My Agency is considering all legal avenues to challenge this decision."Abbott's office did not immediately respond to a phone call seeking comment on the ruling.In August, Abbott called on Texas' Republican-led legislature to reinforce his ban on mask mandates in schools with a law. But lawmakers did not pass any such legislation.Wednesday's ruling in Texas could have implications in other states — including  Arizona, Iowa, Florida, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah — which have also banned mask mandates for students.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendsuniversal indoor masking for all students, staff, teachers, and visitors to K-12 schools, regardless of vaccination status.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Nurith AizenmanThere have now been more than 250 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide. That's according totracking by Johns Hopkins University. This milestone comes as wealthy countries have fully vaccinated about65% of their populations. Yet in low-income countries fewer than3% of peoplehave been vaccinated. Analysts say a major reason for the inequality: Month after month rich countries keep buying many more doses than they're using.Countries and pharmaceutical companies have kept key aspects of their vaccine purchase contracts confidential. So it's not public knowledge precisely how much vaccine each country has been bringing in. ButAirfinity— an independent, London-based analytics company — has been trying to piece this together.Loading...First they've looked into how much COVID vaccine appears to be manufactured every month. "We've seen an extraordinary scale-up of production over the last year," says Airfinity's CEORasmus Bech Hansen. "We had 1.5 billion vaccines produced last month alone."Much of that vaccine is produced by China. But of the rest, Airfinity finds that just under 60% is going to a group of wealthy countries: the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union nations, Canada and Japan.So then Airfinity looked at how many of these doses those wealthy countries appear to be actually using each month — and how many have been left over.Airfinity's estimate: Depending on the country, anywhere from a third to half of the vaccines are going unused. And because this has been happening month after month, the excess has been accumulating. "We're still seeing quite a lot of stockpiling happening," says Hansen.By year's end Airfinity projects the surplus will have reached 1.2 billion doses. And their estimate is roughly in line with projections by several other analysts.Hansen hastens to add that largely due to recent commitments from the U.S. he projects that by December about 600 million of these excess doses will be donated to other countries — about 300 million of that coming from the U.S.But Hansen says that could still leave another 600 million doses sitting unused in stockpiles — with nearly half of that in the U.S. and the rest in the other wealthy countries.And he says that surplus would have been enough to meet a key goal for this year set by the World Health Organization: vaccinating at least 40% of people in lower income countries."It seems increasingly unlikely that the world will achieve that goal. We're still in a situation where only about 2.5% of the low income population has been vaccinated," he says.It gets worse. Airfinity estimates that about 50 million doses in the rich country stockpile are on the point of expiring before they can be donated."It is a tragedy," he says.Also the company's forecasts suggest the unused stockpile will keep growing well into next year — even after accounting for the additional vaccines countries will be using for boosters and extending vaccination to kids.Hansen says this over-buying might have made sense back when there were concerns about how reliably manufacturers could keep pumping out doses. But he maintains that's no longer the case. "Once you know that you have a steady supply you don't actually need to stockpile as much."Andrea Taylorof Duke University'sGlobal Health Innovation Centersays one solution is for wealthy countries to transfer portions of their monthly purchasing rights to other nations. She notes that this might require the vaccine-makers to accept lower payments from those other countries. But she adds with a chuckle, "It takes only the most cursory glance at the income and earnings statements coming out from the vaccine-makers to know that they can take it. They can take the hit without any problem at all."Analysts are also pushing for more of the doses in the existing stockpiles to be shipped overseas. One of them isRachel Silvermanof the Washington think tank Center for Global Development."The logistics as I understand it are somewhat complicated," she says, "but do-able."And so, she adds, the world needs to "figure out how to fix it."Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

The companies are seeking regulatory authorization to expand boosters to everyone 18 and older.Justin Sullivan/Getty Imageshide captionSafeway pharmacist Shahrzad Khoobyari administers a Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 booster shot to Chen Knifsend at a vaccination clinic in San Rafael, Calif., in October. The companies are seeking regulatory authorization to expand boosters to everyone 18 and older.Pfizer and BioNTech have asked the Food and Drug Administration to authorize  their COVID-19 booster shot to all people 18 and older.Thecompanies say the request is based on resultsfrom a study of more than 10,000 volunteers that show vaccine efficacy of 95% or greater for people receiving the booster.The two companies made a similar request in September, but at that time a committee of independent experts that advises the FDA on vaccine matters voted against it.Instead, thecommittee recommendedthat the vaccine be offered to people older than 65 and younger people at increased risk of a severe case of COVID-19  because of an underlying medical condition, a job or a living situation.The FDAdecided to follow the committee's advice.The results of the companies' booster study were not available to the committee when it offered its recommendations.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nearly 25 million people in the United States have received a COVID-19 booster shot, or about 13% of the U.S. population. More than 30% of people 65 and older have received a booster.It's not entirely clear how many more people would qualify for a booster if the FDA grants the Pfizer-BioNTech request.The "underlying medical" conditions that already make some eligible for a vaccine are rather broad: people with mental health conditions, smokers or former smokers, people who are overweight or obese to name a few.Jobs in high risk settings are also fairly broadly defined: first responders, teachers, day care workers, manufacturing workers and grocery store workers are among those covered.A third dose of the vaccine was made available to certain immunocompromised people in August.Anecdotal evidence suggests that many drugstores providing the boosters are not scrupulous in making sure people fall into one of the authorized categories.The FDA has not scheduled a meeting of its independent advisory committee for November, suggesting the agency may make a decision on the Pfizer-BioNTech on its own without seeking external advice.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Rachel TreismanPeople in Singapore mask up to take a mass rapid transit train on Friday. Singapore has one of the highest vaccination rates in the world. As of Sunday, 85% of its population was fully vaccinated.Roslan Rahman/AFP via Getty Imageshide captionPeople in Singapore mask up to take a mass rapid transit train on Friday. Singapore has one of the highest vaccination rates in the world. As of Sunday, 85% of its population was fully vaccinated.Singapore's government has been covering the medical bills of COVID-19 patients throughout the pandemic. But it says unvaccinated people will soon be on their own.Those who are "unvaccinated by choice" will have to start paying for their own COVID-19 treatment starting Dec. 8,the Ministry of Healthannounced on Monday, citing the strain they are putting on the nation's health care system."Currently, unvaccinated persons make up a sizeable majority of those who require intensive inpatient care, and disproportionately contribute to the strain on our healthcare resources," it said in a statement.Until now, the government has been covering the cost of COVID-19 care for all Singaporeans, permanent residents and long-term pass holders, excluding those who tested positive after returning from overseas travel."This was to avoid financial considerations adding to public uncertainty and concern when COVID-19 was an emergent and unfamiliar disease," it explained, adding that this system will continue to apply to "the majority who are vaccinated ... until the COVID-19 situation is more stable."The policy change means the government will start charging all unvaccinated COVID-19 patients admitted to hospitals and designated "COVID-19 Treatment Facilities" on or after Dec. 8. Those patients can still use their regular health care financing arrangements to pay their bills where applicable.There are a few exceptions. People who aren't eligible for vaccination — like children under 12 and people with medical exemptions — will still have their medical bills covered by the government. And people who are partially vaccinated won't be charged until Dec. 31, to give them time to complete the full series.Specifically, starting on Jan. 1, the government will only foot the bill for those Singaporeans (including permanent residents and long-term pass holders) who are fully vaccinated and have not recently traveled."Our hospitals really much prefer not to have to bill these patients at all, but we have to send this important signal, to urge everyone to get vaccinated if you are eligible," Health Minister Ong Ye Kungsaid on Monday.Singapore has one of the highest vaccination rates in the world. As of Sunday, 85% of its population was fully vaccinated, and 18% had received booster shots, according tohealth ministry data.The health minister credited the hard work of vaccination teams with reducing the number of unvaccinated seniors from 175,000 in early August to below 64,000."If not for this reduction, our hospitals and ICUs today would have been already overwhelmed," he added.Singapore had 1,725 recorded hospitalizations as of Monday, with an intensive care unit utilization rate of 68.5%. The health ministry also looked at the difference in cases between those who are fully vaccinated and those who are partially or not at all vaccinated.Over the last seven days, it said, the number of critically ill cases who were fully vaccinated and not fully vaccinated were at 0.5 and 5.2 per 100,000 population, respectively. Over that same period, the number of fully vaccinated and not fully vaccinated cases who died were 0.1 and 0.9 per 100,000 population, respectively. Those numbers were considerably larger for seniors.Singapore has seen a surge in cases over the last few months and decided in October to abandon its"zero COVID strategy"in favor of learning to coexist with the virus.Officials said on Oct. 20 that they would extend their plan for another month, with a midpoint review. Their Monday announcement about COVID-19 medical coverage also said that the growth in new cases had slowed and that certain restrictions have been eased as a result.For example, it will allow up to five fully vaccinated people from the same household to eat together at a dining establishment and take steps to simplify travel protocols.The government also said it would "pilot the resumption of more activities" like sports, meetings and conferences for those who are fully vaccinated, subject to additional rapid testing requirements.Unvaccinated people are not offered those same options."As for individuals who do not want to take any of the vaccines, we will need to have Safe Management Measures which differentiate between the vaccinated and unvaccinated," the health ministry explained. "This is in order to protect the unvaccinated, and also to preserve our healthcare capacity."This story originally appeared ontheMorning Editionlive blog.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Andrea HsuA nurse from AltaMed Health Services hands out the vaccine card to people after receiving their Covid-19 vaccine in Los Angeles, California on August 17, 2021.Frederic J. Brown/AFP via Getty Imageshide captionA nurse from AltaMed Health Services hands out the vaccine card to people after receiving their Covid-19 vaccine in Los Angeles, California on August 17, 2021.It took just a day-and-a-half for President Biden'svaccine-or-test rulecovering 84 million workers to be blocked by a federal appeals court.Now, the Biden administration is gearing up for a fight.In a court brief filed late Monday, administration officials including Solicitor of Labor Seema Nanda warned that maintaining the stay "would endanger many thousands of people.""With the reopening of workplaces and the emergence of the highly transmissible Delta variant, the threat to workers is ongoing and overwhelming," the administration argued, while dismissing the legal objections that led to the stay as lacking merit."Defending a policy is not a new thing," said White House Deputy Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre earlier on Monday. "The administration clearly has the authority to protect workers, and actions announced by the President are designed to save lives and stop the spread of COVID-19."Citing an ongoing death toll of approximately 1,300 people a day, Jean-Pierre urged companies not to delay complying with the rule."Do not wait to take actions that will keep your workplace safe," she said.But whether companies will in fact be required to take any action at all remains an open question, given the barrage of lawsuits facing the administration. More than two dozen states, businesses, business groups and religious organizations have sued, calling the rule issued by the Occupational Health and Safety Administrationan overreach of government authority.The rule, which took effect Friday morning beforeit was temporarily blocked Saturday, requires companies with 100 or more employees to ensure their workers are vaccinated against COVID-19 or undergo weekly testing starting January 4. Covered employers are required to implement a mask mandate for unvaccinated workers by December 6.Among the arguments put forth by states and businesses: OSHA does not have the legal authority to issue a rule to address a society-wide health concern, and even if reducing the risk of COVID-19 "remains a compelling interest," it is not necessarily a "grave danger" as OSHA has declared it to be. The plaintiffs also question the timing of the rule, coming more than a year-and-a-half into the pandemic, when many employers have already implemented safety measures and Covid cases are falling.Almost all of the states suing the Biden administration are led by Republicans, but Kansas Governor Laura Kelly, a Democrat, joined in the criticism.She posted a statement Friday that said while she appreciated the intention to keep workers safe, it was too late to impose a federal standard.In issuing a stay on Saturday, the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, based in New Orleans, said the petitions "give cause to believe there are grave statutory and constitutional issues with the Mandate.""My fear is that they will ignore both precedent, law and constitution and just go ahead and stop this rule," says David Michaels, who led OSHA under President Obama and is now a professor at George Washington University.Because there are challenges to the OSHA rule in multiple circuit courts — including the 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 11th and D.C. Circuits, federal law dictates that the cases be consolidated and heard by one federal appeals court, chosen by lottery. That lottery could take place on or around Nov. 16, according to the U.S. Department of Justice. Ultimately, the case could end up at the Supreme Court.Regardless of what happens in court, Michaels believes a number of companies will move forward as the White House has asked, citing the relief some felt when the government stepped in to require vaccines and testing, a move they were reluctant to take themselves."Many companies will do everything they can to make sure their workers are either vaccinated or tested and safe, so they can reopen safely," he says.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Alana WiseDr. Richard Mulvaney of Mclean, Va., injects the new polio vaccine into the arm of 6-year-old Randall Kerr, the first of some 100 children to be inoculated on April 26, 1954.Harvey Georges/APhide captionDr. Richard Mulvaney of Mclean, Va., injects the new polio vaccine into the arm of 6-year-old Randall Kerr, the first of some 100 children to be inoculated on April 26, 1954.Franklin Sherman Elementary made history as the first school to administer the polio vaccine to its students in 1954 — a fact that First Lady Jill Biden embraced on Monday as she visited the school's COVID-19 vaccination clinic to encourage pediatric vaccinations for children ages 5-11 years old.Biden joined U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy in a visit to the McLean, Va., learning center. Their appearance followedthe recommendation from the Centers for Disease Control and Preventionlast week that young children get a low dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine.Biden, herself an educator, attended the event as part of a nationwide effort to get the nation's eligible children vaccinated against the coronavirus.Children are less susceptible to serious infection from the virus — which is responsible already forthe deaths of more than 750,000 Americans— but still stand the risk of hospitalization or even death from the disease. Children can also contract the virus and pass it along to more vulnerable populations.Biden was introduced by a sixth-grader at the school named Everett, who espoused the importance of vaccines as well as vaccine incentives, which he said should include ice cream for everyone who gets the jab.In her remarks, Biden noted the many steps that parents take every day to keep their children safe, like cutting grapes in half to minimize choking hazards."Parents, we do everything we can to protect our kids," she said."The president and I know how difficult this pandemic has been for your kids and your families. And I'm here today because we care about you and your beautiful children," she said, encouraging parents to vaccinate their children ages 5 and older.First lady Jill Biden delivers remarks with children who were just vaccinated at the Franklin Sherman Elementary School on Monday in McLean, Va.Anna Moneymaker/Getty Imageshide captionFirst lady Jill Biden delivers remarks with children who were just vaccinated at the Franklin Sherman Elementary School on Monday in McLean, Va.In a press release announcing the first lady's visit,Fairfax County Public School hailed the school's historyand the "Polio Pioneers" who broke ground as the first healthy children in the nation to get the polio vaccine."Now, 67 years later, First Lady Jill Biden is scheduled to visit Franklin Sherman ES on Monday, Nov. 8 in a nod to history as part of a nationwide effort to encourage pediatric COVID-19 vaccination. Biden's visit follows the deaths of more than 5 million people around the world from the virus, including more than 750,000 Americans and more than 1,200 Fairfax County residents," the county said.The statement said that the school's sixth-graders had been learning about the role their elementary school had played in polio's eradication."We read articles about the polio vaccine, the history of Franklin Sherman Elementary, and they were tasked with creating public service posters to encourage healthy activities during the pandemic," the statement quoted Romona Wright, a sixth-grade teacher at Franklin Sherman. "A couple of students have said this is just like polio, the pandemic we are going through now."Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

His announcement about getting the COVID-19 vaccine elicited a mixed response.Big Bird ruffled some conservatives' feathers this weekend by announcing that he had been vaccinated against COVID-19.The beloved Muppettweeted on Saturdaythat he had gotten the shot, which isnewly availablefor Americans between the ages of 5 and 11. Big Bird has been a fixture of children's television since 1969 but isofficially 6 years old."My wing is feeling a little sore, but it'll give my body an extra protective boost that keeps me and others healthy," he wrote.Twitter users sounded off in the comments, with many thanking the character for doing his part to keep Sesame Street safe and set a positive example for kids.President Bidenand Centers for Disease Control and PreventionDirector Dr. Rochelle Walenskywere among those who offered their thanks and praise.Others were not as appreciative.Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, decried Big Bird's tweet as "government propaganda."Big Bird coming over to vaccinate your kids.pic.twitter.com/LQODCO3GKgFox News contributorLisa Bootheaccused the Muppet of "brainwashing children," while Newsmax host and former Trump adviserSteve Cortesslammed the announcement as "evil" propaganda.Both made false claims that children are not at risk of COVID-19. While most children infected with the virus exhibit only mild symptoms, experts sayvaccines can prevent many infectionsand hospitalizations, as well as disruptions to schooling.Other commenters denounced Big Bird as apuppet(literally) and communist. Lavern Spicer, a congressional candidate in Florida,wrote that"Big Bird & Elmo are at least a step UP from [Dr. Anthony] Fauci, but using them to push the drug is just as reprehensible nonetheless."And some went much darker, like Tennessee congressional candidateRobby Starbuckand alt-right social media personalityMike Cernovich.Many observers noted the irony of the pile-on, given that Big Bird is both a fictional character and one known for spreading messages of kindness and curiosity.

Joe HernandezAaron Rodgers walks off the field following in Glendale, Arizona on Oct. 28. Rodgers missed the Packers' 13-7 loss to the Chiefs on Sunday after being placed on the league's reserve/COVID-19 list.Christian Petersen/Getty Imageshide captionAaron Rodgers walks off the field following in Glendale, Arizona on Oct. 28. Rodgers missed the Packers' 13-7 loss to the Chiefs on Sunday after being placed on the league's reserve/COVID-19 list.The NFL is batting away a claim by Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers that a league doctor told him people vaccinated against COVID-19 couldn't contract or spread the virus.Rodgers made the claim inan appearanceFriday on "The Pat McAfee Show" on Friday, defending his decision to not get vaccinated and criticizing the league for how it's treated unvaccinated players."One of the main docs said it's impossible for a vaccinated person to get COVID or spread COVID," Rodgers said during the interview. "We know now that information is totally false."In an emailed statement, NFL spokesperson Brian McCarthy denied Rodger's version of events."No, it's not true," McCarthy said. "No doctor from the league or the joint NFL-NFLPA infectious disease consultants communicated with the player. If they had, they certainly would have never said anything like that."Public health experts say the three coronavirus vaccines are shown to vastly reduce the likelihood of severe illness and death from COVID-19, but they are not 100% effective inblocking infectionor preventing people from spreading the disease.Rodgers missed the Packers' 13-7 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday after being placed on the league's reserve/COVID-19 list last week following a positive test. He is not vaccinated but previously said he was "immunized," which he clarified in the interview meant that he's following a separate protocol recommended by his personal medical team.Rodgers said he couldn't get the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines because he's allergic to an ingredient in them. He also said that the Johnson & Johnson shot was "not even an option" for him in the spring after it wasbriefly shelvedover blood clotting concerns, and said he'd heard of multiple people who'd had "adverse events" after getting the jab.Rodgers said he asked the league to accept his immunization plan in lieu of getting vaccinated, but the league denied his request.The Wisconsin health care company Prevea Health announced it was ending its partnership with Rodgers following his comments about the COVID-19 vaccine."Prevea Health remains deeply committed to protecting its patients, staff, providers and communities amidst the COVID-19 pandemic," the companysaid in a statementon Saturday. "This includes encouraging and helping all eligible populations to become vaccinated against COVID-19 to prevent the virus from further significantly impacting lives and livelihoods."But the insurance giant State Farm called Rodgers a "great ambassador for our company" and did not announce plans to part ways with the star quarterback."We don't support some of the statements that he has made, but we respect his right to have his own personal point of view," the company said in a statement shared with NPR."Our mission at State Farm is to support safer, stronger communities. To that end, we encourage vaccinations, but respect everyone's right to make a choice based on their personal circumstances."Still, marketing data shows that State Farm reduced the number of ads it ran featuring Rodgers after his comments,Action Network reported.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Anya KamenetzLA JohnsonThe first time kids had to get a vaccine to go to school was more than 200 years ago. The disease?Smallpox.For the past four decades, all 50 U.S. states have required that parents, if they want to enroll their children in any school, public or private, must vaccinate them against contagious diseases likepolioand measles. The reason is simple: High rates of vaccination dramatically cut deaths and have all but eliminated some diseases.But as long as there have been vaccines, there have beenpeople who oppose them, formerly known as "anti-vaccinationists." They have brought many legal challenges over the years, but the U.S. Supreme Courtruled onthe constitutionality of school vaccine mandates nearly a century ago, and that has pretty much been upheld to this day.That said, there's also a strong tradition of granting exemptions to vaccine requirements based on religious and philosophical beliefs. There has also, at times, been lax enforcement and an unwillingness to punish students by keeping them out of school.But when diseases break out or come back, so do vaccine campaigns and the really strong stuff: mandates.Scroll on to take a look at a historical timeline of vaccines in schools:
   
Bill ChappellPfizer says its experimental pill for COVID-19 cut rates of hospitalization and death by nearly 90% among patients with mild-to-moderate infections.Mark Lennihan/APhide captionPfizer says its experimental pill for COVID-19 cut rates of hospitalization and death by nearly 90% among patients with mild-to-moderate infections.Pfizer says that its COVID-19 pill reduced the risk of hospitalization or death by 89%, in a clinical trial that tested the drug in adults with the disease who were also in high-risk health groups.The oral medicine is called Paxlovid. Similar toMerck's new pillthat was approved in the U.K. on Thursday, Pfizer said its drug showed good results when administered within five days of the first COVID-19 symptoms.Based on the strength of the trial's results, Pfizer says it will stop enrolling people into more clinical trials for the pill and will instead send the results it has so far to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to seek emergency use authorization."These data suggest that our oral antiviral candidate, if approved or authorized by regulatory authorities, has the potential to save patients' lives, reduce the severity of COVID-19 infections, and eliminate up to nine out of ten hospitalizations," Pfizer CEO and chairman Albert Bourla said.Both of the antiviral medicines from Pfizer and Merck attack the coronavirus by interfering with its ability to replicate itself.Pfizer says its pill is also helped by co-administering a low dose of ritonavir, a drug used in HIV/AIDS treatment regimens. Ritonavir helps protease inhibitors like the Pfizer drug persist longer in the human body, making them more effective in fighting a virus.Officials in both the U.S. and U.K. say that effective COVID-19 pills could be a game-changer in the fight to end the pandemic, because the pills can easily be administered at home.Regeneron's antibody cocktail has become a key tool in medical workers' rush to prevent the worst outcomes for people who've contracted COVID-19, but the monoclonal antibody treatment requires either an intravenous infusion or a series of shots.Pfizer says its drug could be prescribed to reduce the severity of COVID-19 patients' illness, as well as to cut the chances that adults get infected after they've been exposed to the coronavirus."It has demonstrated potent antiviral in vitro activity against circulating variants of concern, as well as other known coronaviruses, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic for multiple types of coronavirus infections," the company said as it announced the drug trial results.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Jaclyn DiazKentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron and attorneys general for Ohio and Tennessee filed a lawsuit claiming the new federal vaccine mandate is government overreach. He's pictured in 2020.Timothy D. Easley/APhide captionKentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron and attorneys general for Ohio and Tennessee filed a lawsuit claiming the new federal vaccine mandate is government overreach. He's pictured in 2020.The chief law enforcement officials for Kentucky, Tennessee and Ohioare challengingthe Biden administration's mandate requiring that federal contractors get the COVID-19 vaccine.The Republican attorneys general in these three statessaidthey filed their lawsuit against the federal government Thursday — just hours after the White House rolled out new rules covering more than 100 million workers in the U.S.This lawsuit asks a judge to stop the implementation of the mandate,which gives certain contractors until Jan. 4to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19. If those workers choose not to get vaccinated, they must test negative for COVID-19 at least once a week. The lawsuit claims the mandate is an example of federal overreach and both "unlawful and unconstitutional."This lawsuit is just part of what is already panning out to be a mountain of legal challenges against this vaccine mandate. InSeptember, when the White House first announcedits plans, critics — largely the Republican Party — promised to sue.And they are keeping their word. Late Thursday, officials from dozens of states announced plans to file major lawsuits by Friday, when the administration's rule is officially published in theFederal Register.Several Republican-led states are working together in these legal challenges. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear is a Democrat, but the lawsuit the state is pursuing is being led by Attorney General Daniel Cameron, who is Republican.A lawsuit thatGeorgia officials saythey plan to file also includes South Carolina, West Virginia, Utah, Idaho, Alabama and Kansas.A suit that Missouri officials plan to file on Fridayreportedly includes Alaska, Arkansas, Iowa, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wyoming.Indiana will challenge the rules in three separate lawsuits in the coming week, according tothe state's attorney general.Texas also suedindividually last Friday. "The Biden Administration has repeatedly expressed its disdain for Americans who choose not to get a vaccine, and it has committed repeated and abusive federal overreach to force upon Americans something they do not want," Attorney General Paxton said.Labor Secretary Marty Walsh toldAll Things Consideredon Thursday that the administration is well-prepared for the onslaught of lawsuits.Labor Secretary Marty Walsh told NPR that the Biden administration is prepared to fight the lawsuits against the federal vaccine mandate.J. David Ake/APhide captionLabor Secretary Marty Walsh told NPR that the Biden administration is prepared to fight the lawsuits against the federal vaccine mandate."We're confident about the rule put together, and I think it's unfortunate that this rule has been out for about eight hours now and people already are suing on it," he said. "This is about protecting workers in the workplace. This is about protecting Americans. This is about increasing our number of people in this country that are vaccinated."Kentucky, Tennessee and Ohio — like many states — have contracts with the federal government in different capacities. For example, local jails in Kentucky have contracts with the U.S. Justice Department and the U.S. Marshals Service to hold and transport prisoners in custody for federal crimes.In Ohio, state universities have contracts with multiple federal agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration and the National Institutes of Health, according to the lawsuit.By requiring employees to get vaccinated against COVID-19, the federal government is threatening their lucrative federal contracts amounting to a possible loss of millions of dollars, that lawsuit claims.Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost saidone of the top concerns is the potential loss of workers who quit rather than get vaccinated."A natural and predictable consequence of the mandate is that employers who are critical to the supply chain, and are also federal contractors, will likely lose significant numbers of employees," the lawsuit claims. "It is entirely predictable, therefore, that the mandate will exacerbate current supply chain issues."State leaders said private employees with more than 100 workers, which one of the new federal rules cover, also stand to be financially hurt.Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt said Thursday, "I've been in discussions with businesses in Missouri who say that this vaccine mandate will crush their business."Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost, pictured in 2020, says one of the top concerns is the potential loss of workers who quit rather than get vaccinated.Julie Carr Smyth/APhide captionOhio Attorney General Dave Yost, pictured in 2020, says one of the top concerns is the potential loss of workers who quit rather than get vaccinated.Also at the core of these legal challenges is the argument that the federal government is overreaching its authority on states' rights. The argument in the Kentucky, Tennessee and Ohio case says that Congress did not give the president authority to issue such a broad mandate.Labor Secretary Walsh said this rule overrides state and local laws banning or limiting employers' ability to mandate vaccines or testing. He toldAll Things Considered,in part, "It's no different than a law in Texas that would supersede a local law."State officials such as Ohio's Yostsaid Thursdaythat the rules violate the Constitution."I've said it many times: The Biden administration may not do whatever it wants however it wants," Yostsaid. "The Constitution lays out critical rules by which the executive branch must operate. Congress and the states have their own powers, which the administration can't just take over because it wants to."Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Ashley WestermanA resort at Natadola Bay in Fiji is among many to have felt the effect of COVID on tourism.Aileen Torrest-Bennett/AFP via Getty Imageshide captionA resort at Natadola Bay in Fiji is among many to have felt the effect of COVID on tourism.The main island of Tonga has gone into a week-long lockdown after the South Pacific nationreported its very first COVID-19 case of the pandemic late last week.The COVID-positive traveler, who is fully vaccinated and was showing no symptoms, arrived in Tonga last Wednesday on a flight from Christchurch, New Zealand. All 214 others aboard the flight have tested negative and the infected traveler,a young missionary, is currently quarantined in a facility."So far, we're very happy that nothing else has happened besides that one case," Dr. Viliami Puloka told NPR from his home in Nuku'alofa, the capital of Tonga. The retired general practitioner and public health specialist said it was just a matter of time before the virus reached them."I think in general, people do understand what is happening and it's been expected that at some point, as long as this virus is anywhere, this virus everywhere," he said.Under the lockdown, which began at midnight Tuesday, schools, bars and restaurants will be closed for a week and a curfew imposed on the island of Tongatapu, where a majority of Tonga's population lives. People will only be able to leave their homes for essential business, such as getting groceries, medicine or banking.Puloka said while the chance of the virus getting out into the wider community was very slim, the community seemed keen to keep it from spreading. The confirmed case has spurred a rush to get vaccinated,according to local media."I think it was just kind of disappointing because they were looking forward to opening up the border and accepting people from outside, but this is what has happened," Puloka said.Small Pacific island nations and territories have been spared the worst of the pandemic because of their ability to isolate themselves from the rest of the world.Puloka said if an outbreak of COVID-19 were to happen in Tonga, a cluster of islands about 500 miles southeast of Fiji, its limited resources and natural isolation would foster "a very huge disaster that I don't think we can really handle."Yetshutting borders long-term for countries that depend economically on commodity exports and tourismhas led to a glaring irony of the pandemic: Those who have managed to keep the pandemic out may be some of the last to recover from it.A policy brief from the Australia-based Lowy Institutereleased last year warned that countries and territories across the Pacific faced a potential "lost decade" and a permanent economic setback due to the economic and social damage wrought by the pandemic.A year later, the outlook for the region remains largely the same, says Roland Rajah, lead economist at the Lowy Institute."Economically speaking, the recovery has been very slow in the Pacific, while the rest of the world is bouncing back," he told NPR.The slow bounce-back of tourism in some Pacific countries and territories is to blame. While others, such as Papua New Guinea — the largest economy in the region and a country dependent on commodity exports — are simply more overwhelmed with COVID-19 than they were last year, Rajah said.And while the region as a whole has a good vaccination rate, Rajah says the light at the end of the tunnel "is not actually even clear.""I think at the moment, that's what it looks like the Pacific is very much likely to be amongst the slowest, if not the slowest region, to recover from from this crisis," he said.Some countries across the vast Pacific, which includes 2.3 million people spread across roughly 15% of the globe, have attempted to balance their economic needs with the health of their people.French Polynesia is one of them. Tourism isthe French overseas territory's main economic driverandofficials have estimated a nearly $1.2 billion loss because the pandemicbrought international tourism to a standstill.Tourists go snorkeling in Fiji. Tourism has taken a major hit in the Pacific.Victor Bonito/Reef Explorer Fiji/AFP via Gettyhide captionTourists go snorkeling in Fiji. Tourism has taken a major hit in the Pacific.After initially shutting its borders in March of 2020, French Polynesia, which includes renowned tourist islands Tahiti and Bora Bora, has since opened and closed its borders a handful of times. The territory has also made exceptions for French citizens and locals,such as politicians, to travel in and out, says Guillaume Colombani, a long-time tourism worker in Tahiti.Still, he says that since the start of the pandemic the tourism sector "has suffered a lot."Paris controls the borders. Each time they're opened, people there get "very scared," Colombani says. French Polynesia has racked up over 45,000 COVID-19 cases and some 636 deaths.This attempted balancing act has left many, like Colombani, unsure "that all the decisions that were made or taken were very good for us."Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

Birthday parties. Long-awaited family reunions.Those are among the activities and gatherings that parents told NPR they hope to make possible for their kids followinga formal recommendation of Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccinefor children ages 5 to 11 from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.CDC Director Rochelle Walenskygave her recommendationTuesday evening, just a few hours after a panel advising the CDC voted unanimously to support the vaccine for the age group, and days after the Food and Drug Administration authorized its use for this age group. The latestpandemic milestonemakes around 28 million kids in the U.S. eligible to receive the vaccine in a lower dose than what adults are given.Many parents, including Eric Nichols and Nell Hathaway, expressed relief and hope that this would mark another step in the direction of normalcy. Their daughter Harper is 5, and though Nichols and Hathaway are both vaccinated, they say they're still limited in what they feel safe doing as a family until everyone has had their shots."You can't eat at restaurants or go to the children's museum ... here because of the risk," Hathaway says. "It just really has limited her life."That includes not being able to see family. Nichols says it's been two years since they've seen his side of the family in Ohio. But they're planning to make the trip from Olympia, Wash. this year, and Nichols says it will "be a very big day when we get to hug them."Hathaway says it's been nearly two years of living with constant stress over the pandemic. Not all of that will go away, but she's looking forward to having less fear once Harper is vaccinated."Seeing family in Ohio is really important and it's kind of scary," they say. "We're going this November for Thanksgiving, but we're really hoping to at least get the first shot before then, because the relief of our safety is just greatly reduced when she has it."Some of that relief came Wednesday morning when they were able to secure an appointment for Harper for next Monday.Natasha Greaves holds her daughter, Laila Greaves, 5, after Laila received a Pfizer-BioNtech COVID-19 vaccine on Wednesday in Shoreline, Wash.David Ryder/Getty Imageshide captionNatasha Greaves holds her daughter, Laila Greaves, 5, after Laila received a Pfizer-BioNtech COVID-19 vaccine on Wednesday in Shoreline, Wash.The latest vaccine authorization and CDC guidance means that some families may be completely vaccinated. But in many families, not all children are old enough to receive the vaccine.Mabel Cordero Leathem is a mom to a 6-year-old daughter and a 4-year-old son. She says she and her husband have been following the news leading up to this moment closely, and are excited to soon have one more family member vaccinated.Cordero Leathem says she's looking forward to giving her daughter the childhood rite of passage that is a sleepover with a friend (whose family is also vaccinated)."You know, you can have playdates ... but to me the idea of having another child [from another family] in my home, you know, making them breakfast, sharing our air ... that's like the closest you can get, right? And it's just so joyful," she says. "I'm ready for that."The family will remain cautious because of their son who's not yet eligible for a vaccine, Cordero Leathem says. But this current phase will give their daughter "that little bit of extra freedom" to enjoy her friendships without as much anxiety.While some parents are planning to vaccinate their kids as soon as possible, others areplanning to wait a littlebit before scheduling those shots.Arecent Kaiser Family Foundation surveyshowed how parents feel about vaccinating the 5-11 age group varies widely. Nearly a third of parents said they were eager to secure a vaccine for their child in this age group upon authorization. Another third said theywanted to wait and seehow the vaccine works in this age group before scheduling their own appointments. And the last third of parents said they do not plan on getting their child the vaccine.In Greenville, N.C., Heather Gilbert and her husband, who works in family medicine, fall more into the second group of parents who are waiting to see how the vaccine does in a larger group of kids, specifically when it comes to side effects like myocarditis, a form of heart inflammation. The side effect has shown to be rare after COVID vaccinations, withthe CDC reporting 877 confirmed casesin people 30 or younger with no resulting deaths."We just want to wait until there is more of a population that's been recorded and studied to make sure that the side effects — the adverse side effects — aren't outweighing the benefits for the vaccine," Gilbert says.Gilbert says she is supportive of parents who do want to get their kids vaccinated immediately, but that the risk calculus for her family is slightly different.Both she and her husband are fully vaccinated, and the couple's two daughters, ages 6 and 7, are homeschooled. Gilbert says they wear masks when in indoor spaces and all of their playdates are outside. But overall, they're not in environments with large groups of people indoors.The family does belong to a large church, but because of a lack of masks on parents and kids, they've continued attending worship virtually, Gilbert says.She says she'd like to get her girls back to in-person church sooner rather than later and hopes to revisit the conversation on COVID vaccinations at the beginning of the new year."We know that vaccines, what they're given, have a pretty quick turnaround for reaction time, so it shouldn't take that long once people start getting their children vaccinated to see whether there are a substantial amount of adverse side effects or not," Gilbert says. "I'm hoping by the beginning of January we can revisit that topic after a couple hundred thousand children have been vaccinated, and there's a larger population that's been looked at."For this story, we reached out to our audience and heard from more than 3,000 parents on what they're planning to do when it comes to vaccinating their kids in the 5-11 year-old age group, and from parents who have kids that are not yet eligible for a vaccine.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Will StoneA long-running decline in COVID-19 cases nationally masks some trouble spots emerging in the upper half of the United States. The disease is hitting states in the Mountain West such as Colorado, Utah and Wyoming especially hard, but even parts of the Northeast have dealt with a worrying surge in cases and hospitalizations.Helen H. Richardson/MediaNews Group/Denver Post via Getty Imageshide captionA long-running decline in COVID-19 cases nationally masks some trouble spots emerging in the upper half of the United States. The disease is hitting states in the Mountain West such as Colorado, Utah and Wyoming especially hard, but even parts of the Northeast have dealt with a worrying surge in cases and hospitalizations.The U.S. has settled into an uneasy, drawn-out exit from the delta surge that took hold over the summer.For many weeks, declining cases and hospitalizations have offered hope ahead of the holiday season, when Americans travel and spend more time indoors, but progress has stalled recently, with cases rising or plateauing in more than 20 states.In fact, the country's daily average of cases has hovered around 72,000 infections for the past two weeks as outbreaks smolder, particularly in the northern half of the country. About 40,000 people are in the hospital with COVID-19, under half of the peak in early September.The Mountain West — where vaccination coverage tends to be lower — is the worst off, especially Colorado, Wyoming and Montana. Parts of the Southwest and Midwest are also trying to control an uptick. Even some of the heavily vaccinated Northeast has been dealing with increases during the fall.Modeling suggests that cases will likely stay high through the holiday season but will not accelerate into a new nationwide surge as occurred last year, saysDr. David Rubin, who leads the COVID-19 modeling group at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia."The next few weeks are really going to tell us about the holiday season," he says. "I've got cautious optimism, particularly in highly vaccinated areas right now."Now that younger kids can start to get vaccinated, that could make a substantial difference in controlling cases as families gather together. That gives Rubin "the greatest hope that our worst days are behind us."Some experts are less sanguine about what direction the pandemic is heading, though."There is more than enough human wood for this coronavirus forest fire to burn," saysMichael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. Researchers there estimate that about 70 million Americans remain vulnerable to the virus due to a combination of waning immunity and lack of vaccination."It's not going to look like it was in January because we have a lot of immunity," saysDr. Julie Parsonnet, a professor of epidemiology and population health at  Stanford University. "But we're going to see waves — the peak of the waves is going to get lower and lower, but we're still going to see them as the population gets more and more immune."As cases have plummeted in the South, many parts of the West have contended with their worst surges to date."In the 12 years I've been with the hospital, it's hands down the busiest, including compared to last fall," saysDr. Andy Dunn, head of primary care at Wyoming Medical Center, the state's largest hospital. "We're seeing more COVID patients, and we're seeing sicker COVID patients."Withonly about 44% of its population fully vaccinated, Wyoming ranks below almost every other state. This reality, coupled with the arrival of the delta variant of the coronavirus, had Dunn's hospital prepping months ago: "We knew it was going to hit, so it's been very stressful."In Utah, health officials were on the brink of activating statewide plans to ration care last fall, and now the situation looks nearly as bad, saysDr. Angela Dunn, executive director at the Salt Lake County Health Department."We are definitely in a crisis in terms of people getting the care they need," she says. "When a patient needs an ICU bed, it takes us two to three hours because they're all full. Usually it takes 10 minutes."To her dismay, many members of the public seem unaware of the distress in their local hospitals. And Dunn's hope that this would propel more people to get vaccinated — Utah's vaccination rate is about 53% — have not materialized. "We're just seeing a really low, slow uptake," she says.Meanwhile, Colorado's governor, Jared Polis,has issued ordersthat allow hospitals to turn away some patients if necessary and that clarify when hospitals can activate thestate's crisis standards of care plan, due to the crush of patients filling up intensive care units."We have all these COVID-positive patients, but we also have a lot of other patients that during our last major surge we weren't seeing," saysDr. Michelle Barron, medical director of infection control and prevention at UCHealth, Colorado's largest health system.The backlog of other patients, often people who delayed care, and the staffing shortages have put its hospitals in a precarious position. Colorado has vaccinated more than 60% of its population against COVID-19, putting it ahead of many other neighboring states. But Barron says that this still leaves plenty of people who are potentially susceptible to infection or who can have complications because their immune system is compromised."The vast majority of the patients that we're seeing really are those that are still unvaccinated," she says.Even some states that had set the standard for successful vaccination campaigns have weathered a big wave of infections this fall.Vermont is one sobering example.The state has vaccinated more than 70% of its population against COVID-19, including the vast majority of its older adults. Still, it hit new records in daily coronavirus cases last month, although the per capita rate was not as high as in many states at the peak of their surges."We had as many or more patients at this point than we've ever had over the course of the last two years," saysDr. Rick Hildebrant, chief of hospital medicine at Rutland Regional Medical Center in Rutland, Vermont. "But we have never seen the type of scenarios in other parts of the country, where the hospital systems have just been overwhelmed by COVID."In fact, COVID-19 accounts for a small portion of the overall patient volume in Vermont's hospitals, which are also struggling with very busy emergency rooms and the consequences of deferred care. However, the added stress of a coronavirus surge has pushed the hospitals to "operate beyond capacity for weeks," saysTim Lahey, an infectious disease physician at UVM Medical Center."It's a clarion call to other states that are catching up to Vermont: Just because you have high adult vaccination percentages doesn't mean that the game is over," he says.While cases are now trending down in the state, Lahey says the surge there has also revealed that a "vaccine only" strategy — one that dispenses with interventions like masks — can be risky when a relatively small portion of the population remains unvaccinated.But Vermont's experience does underscore that well-vaccinated states can stave off the kind of disaster seen in other states such as Idaho and Wyoming, where half, if not more, of the population remains unvaccinated, hospitals were overwhelmed and death rates were much higher."The data is unassailable at this point in terms of the protection of broad community vaccination against severe disease," says Rubin, of Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.Some major cities in the Northeast have also seen increased transmission this fall, he says, but "they're still holding up pretty well," and that could mean they  "prove somewhat resilient through the holiday season."Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Geoff BrumfielDr. Lee Merritt is a orthopedic and spinal surgeon who spreads misinformation about COVID-19. She is affiliated with a prominent right-wing group known as America's Frontline Doctors.R. Kellman/Screenshot from Rumblehide captionFor much of the pandemic, Dr. Lee Merritt has appeared on talk shows and in lecture halls to spread false information about COVID-19.Among her claims: that the SARS-CoV2 virus is a genetically engineered bioweapon (the U.S. intelligence communitysays it's not). And that vaccination dramatically increases the risk of death from COVID (data showan enormous drop in riskfor those who take the vaccine). The entire pandemic, she says in public lectures, is a vast global conspiracy to exert social control.And yet, in October, she was able to renew her medical license in the state of Nebraska. Documents obtained through a public records request by NPR showed it took just a few clicks: 12 yes-or-no questions answered online allowed her to extend her license for another year.Critics say that Merritt's renewal isanother example of how the nation's state medical boards are failing to protect the publicfrom a small minority of doctors spreading COVID falsehoods."State medical boards, for the main part, have been cozy clubs of people who feel their job is to protect the profession," says Imran Ahmed, the CEO of theCenter for Countering Digital Hate, a group that tracks vaccine misinformation online.In the past, that's meant a slow process that provided physicians every opportunity to defend themselves against a complaint, he claims. But in the current pandemic, Ahmed argues, medical boards need to move faster and with more force. "Speeches aren't enough, letters aren't enough, we need action now," he says.Doctors have been trusted sources of medical advice throughout the pandemic. Experts believe the handful who spread misinformation are fueling vaccine hesitancy.Joseph Prezioso/AFP via Getty Imageshide captionDoctors have been trusted sources of medical advice throughout the pandemic. Experts believe the handful who spread misinformation are fueling vaccine hesitancy.Few people have been more influential over the course of the pandemic than doctors. They have been at the front lines, battling COVID and facilitating the vaccine rollout. Public health officials also see doctors as a major tool in fighting misinformation. Officials encourage vaccine-hesitant individuals to talk to their physician, as a way of combatting the vortex of false claims and conspiracy theories online.But a handful of doctors like Dr. Merritt have worked contrary to these efforts: spreading bad information about COVID-19. Their qualifications make their message especially dangerous, says Nick Sawyer, an emergency room doctor who headsNo License For Disinformation, a group seeking action against doctors who spread falsehoods."Physicians should be held to a higher standard because people are entrusting us with their lives," he says.The licensing of physicians in the United States varies from state to state. Medical boards are typically set up under state law and populated with a mix of doctors, lawyers and citizens. The boards can receive complaints from any member of the public. They then investigate and carry out disciplinary action according to their own rules and the laws of the state.License renewals are often automatic, and Sawyer says he wants that process to be as smooth as possible. But he is also frustrated by the lack of disciplinary action: "If you're a physician in good standing, then you should be able to continue your practice without having to jump through a bunch of hoops," he says. "But that is also assuming that the medical board is doing its job."So far, it appears that many physicians spreading bad information have escaped censure. In September, NPR looked at 16 doctors who have spread false claims about COVID, including Merritt. Records show that none have been disciplined, and all but one continue to hold an active medical license. And Dr. Merritt was not the only one who obtained a renewal.Public records obtained by NPR show that Dr. Sherri Tenpenny, another prominent anti-vaccine physician who claims — among other things — that vaccines make people magnetic, renewed her license online. TheOhio Capitol Journalfirst reportedTenpenny's renewal in September.Neither Dr. Merritt nor Nebraska's Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees its medical board, responded to NPR's request for comment. But Dr. Humayun Chaudhry, the president of theFederation of State Medical Boards, an umbrella group, says medical license renewals are designed to be simple for doctors."It's a procedural step that is usually automatic and not even deliberated upon by the board," he says. He says boards simply don't have the capacity to review many hundreds or thousands of renewals that come up each year, and that a failure to renew would be equivalent to a license suspension, which cannot be done without due process. But he also says the renewals do not prevent boards from taking action."A medical license that's automatically renewed does not mean that an investigation isn't ongoing, nor does it prevent a board from taking a disciplinary action against that licensee," he says.In fact Chaudhry says a recent survey by the federation found that over half of the nation's medical boards have seen an increase in complaints about doctors disseminating false information about COVID-19. Among those who responded to the FSMB survey, he says 21% have already taken some kind of disciplinary action. Many others are now quietly investigating complaints, Chaudhry says. They just need more time to act.In the meantime, Lee Merritt continues to travel the country, giving speeches filled with junk science.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

As of this week, kids aged 5 to 11 can also get vaccinated against COVID-19.Marcio Jose Sanchez/APhide captionColin Sweeney, 12, got a shot of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine as his mother, Nicole, stands by in Pasadena, Calif., in May. As of this week, kids aged 5 to 11 can also get vaccinated against COVID-19.COVID-19 shots for kids are on their way, butDr. Ibukunoluwa Kalu, a pediatrician and infectious disease specialist at Duke University, says that some parents she has talked with aren't sure how they feel about that."Now that this option is becoming a reality, parents are now weighing that decision of vaccinate or not as we're reaching a point in the pandemic where it seems that case rates have either plateaued or declined quite significantly in a lot of areas," she says. "Which is a good thing, but it puts us in an interesting quandary."Polls show thatmany parentsare on the fence about whether and when to vaccinate their younger kids. We've talked to pediatricians and looked at the data to provide answers to common questions on parents' minds.It's true that most children infected with the virus have only mild symptoms and that children rarely die from the disease. But scientists and health officials recommending the shot emphasize that vaccination could prevent many infections, as well as disruptions to schooling, hospitalizations and rare but severe complications of the disease.More than 8,300kids aged 5 to 11 have been hospitalized with COVID-19 because of serious illness. According to a CDC analysis, the number of children and adolescentsadmitted to the hospital increased nearly fivefoldover the summer months amid the delta surge.In addition, more than5,200 children and teens have developed MIS-C, or multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, a condition linked to COVID-19 that often leads to ICU admission. The median age of kids getting MIS-C is 9 years old.It's hard to predict which kids who get COVID-19 will be struck with severe COVID-19 or MIS-C. In oneCDC analysis of hospitalization records, roughly 30% of kids hospitalized with COVID-19 had no underlying health conditions that would have put them at increased risk."Everything about this virus is unpredictable," saysDr. David Kimberlin, an infectious disease pediatrician at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. "And we need to do everything we can to protect ourselves and to protect our children against what this virus is very capable of doing."Black, Native American and Hispanic children were three times more likely to be hospitalized than white children,according to the CDC.At least791 children have diedfrom COVID-19, including 172 children ages 5 to 11. "I have sat beside the bed of patients who are struggling to breathe," says Kimberlin. His hospital has treated many adolescents who were old enough to be vaccinated but hadn't been and then ended up on ventilators or ECMO, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. In this situation, he says, parents are grieving. "And in the back of their mind, they also know they could have been prevented," Kimberlin says.For some clinicians, the argument for vaccination comes down to the idea that no child should ever die from a disease that could have been prevented by simply getting a shot. "COVID-19 is now a vaccine-preventable disease from my perspective," saidDr. Amanda Cohn, during last week's FDA advisory committee that voted in favor of authorizing the vaccine for younger kids."It's the8th highest killerof kids in this age group over the past year," Cohn said. "The use of this vaccine will prevent deaths, ICU admissions and will prevent significant long-term adverse outcomes in children."A clinical trial conducted by Pfizer and BioNTech studied a 10-microgram vaccine dose in children ages 5 to 11. This is a third of the dose given to adults and children 12 and older. The lower dose was chosen to minimize side effects but still prompting a strong immune response, according to the vaccine makers.The data the drug companies presented to the FDA showed that the vaccine was 90.7% effective against symptomatic COVID-19. The antibody response to the vaccine was comparable to the one seen in people 16 to 25 years old.Pediatricians also point to real-world data on the effectiveness of the vaccines in 12- to 17-year-olds. Amid the recent delta surge, hospitalization rates wereabout 10 times higherin unvaccinated adolescents than vaccinated ones, according to a recent CDC analysis.A 10-year-old child receives the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine for 5- to 11-year-old kids at Hartford Hospital in Hartford, Connecticut on November 2, 2021.Joseph Presioso/AFP via Getty Imageshide captionA 10-year-old child receives the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine for 5- to 11-year-old kids at Hartford Hospital in Hartford, Connecticut on November 2, 2021.No new safety problems were identified in the companies' studies of this vaccine.The mostcommon side effectsdocumented in the study were similar to those other age groups have had with COVID-19 vaccines. The most common were pain at the injection site, fatigue and headache and muscle aches. Kids who get the vaccine feel "ultimately fine in two or three days," Kalu says.Should I be concerned about serious side effects, especially myocarditis?In very rare cases, following vaccination with mRNA vaccines made by Pfizer and Moderna, people have developed inflammation of the heart muscle, which is known as myocarditis. In Pfizer's clinical trial for 5- to 11-year-olds, there were no cases of myocarditis, although the company acknowledged that the trials were not big enough to pick up such rare events.Myocarditis after vaccination is "very, very rare," explains Kimberlin. And it's usually short-lived. In most instances, adolescents who've developed myocarditis have improved quickly. "The management of it usually is taking some ibuprofen — some Advil," Kimberlin says.Rates of post-vaccination myocarditis are expected to be lower in young kids than those observed in teens. Myocarditis, which can also occur after bacterial and viral infections, including COVID-19, is generally significantly less common among younger children. That's partly because the condition is linked with puberty hormones, explains pediatricianNicole Baldwin, who practices in Cincinnati.And the smaller dose size for younger kids may also reduce the risk, Kalu adds. "The physiology behind why they saw some of the post-vaccine myocarditis seems to be related to how the immune system is reacting to the vaccine. It's mounting a protective level of antibody, but maybe a little overzealous in those efforts," she says.Of 877 reports of vaccine-related myocarditis in people under 30, no deaths have been confirmed, according to data presented at the CDC's advisory meeting Tuesday. Dr. Matthew Oster, who studies myocarditis for the CDC and is a pediatric cardiologist at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, explained that COVID-19 itself can cause myocarditis and other heart-related issues, as well as MIS-C, which often affects the heart."The bottom line is getting COVID, I think, is much riskier to the heart than getting this vaccine," Oster said.Many pediatricians urge parents not to wait — first of all because their children will still be at risk for getting sick from COVID-19. "You can't wait until millions and millions of doses are given before you decide, because this virus is going to take every opportunity it can to infect someone," saysDr. Tina Tan, pediatrician and infectious disease specialist at Northwestern and Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago.Even though COVID-19 cases are trending downward, 90% of counties in the U.S. are still classified by CDC ashaving "high" or "substantial" viral spread."Because the delta variant is that much more transmissible, kids can get delta and can get quite sick from it,'' says Tan. "You cannot predict — in a normal healthy child — who's going to get very sick and who's not. [Vaccinating] is the best way to protect your child against getting severe COVID illness."Acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock made a similar point when she was asked about parents who wanted to wait to vaccinate their kids in apress conference Friday. "As a parent, if I had young children in this age group, I would get them vaccinated now." she said.Are there some kids that might be at higher risk and want to hurry to get vaccinated?Certain families should consider getting in the front of the line for shots, Kalu says.One group that should not delay, she says, are "kids that have conditions that may put them at higher risk for severe disease — and that could be as simple as obesity, chronic respiratory conditions, maybe even kidney disease or high blood pressure."For families with babies or grandparents or other vulnerable people — like an immunocompromised family member — at home, vaccinating your young children as soon as they're eligible will help keep those people safe.And if you live in an area where the weather is getting chilly, that's going to mean people are indoors more often, which raises your risk of catching COVID-19.Especially if you are having family members or friends in for the holidays, keep in mind that "it is safer to gather in a fully vaccinated environment than not," Kalu says. "So even in just the interest of keeping your small community safe as you gather over the holidays, it may be good to get kids vaccinated prior to that."Baldwin agrees. "If we're getting these kids vaccinated now before they go hug Grandma and Grandpa at Christmas, that can offer additional protection to our more vulnerable population," she says.If my child already had COVID-19, do they need this shot? Don't they have immunity?Even for kids who've already had COVID-19, pediatricians say it's still beneficial to get the vaccine. "We don't yet really understand the duration of immunity when it comes to kids," Baldwin explains. Often kids get mild infections, so "we don't know what that correlates to in terms of antibody levels and how long are they going to be protected," she says.For kids who've had a very recent COVID-19 infection, she says, she understands why parents may not be the first to rush out and get the vaccine. It's probable that their children have immunity in the months following the illness. But, ultimately, she says the vaccine is the best way to ensure strong and lasting protection against the virus.Some parents might be tempted to get their child's antibody levels tested, but Dr. Kate Russell Woodworth, a medical epidemiologist with the CDC, said at a CDC advisers' meeting Tuesday that those tests aren't a reliable way to determine if a person is protected from reinfection. The CDCrecommends againstusing them for vaccination decisions.A 10-year-old child high fives Pharmacist Colleen Teevan after he received the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine for kids at Hartford Hospital in Hartford, Connecticut on November 2, 2021.Josehp Prezioso/AFP via Getty Imageshide captionA 10-year-old child high fives Pharmacist Colleen Teevan after he received the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine for kids at Hartford Hospital in Hartford, Connecticut on November 2, 2021."I would not advise waiting," says Baldwin. "I think it's important for parents to understand the lower dosage provided as robust an immune response as the higher dosage did in older kids with less side effects."Baldwin says if your child has a 12th birthday coming up very soon, she says it's OK to wait, but the dose provided in the children's formulation is enough to protect them from the virus.If your child turns 12 between their first and second dose,AAP suggestssticking with the lower, 10-microgram dose for both shots.Masks have proven to be a key tool for preventing outbreaks in schools, but some experts point out that indoor masking can't go on forever."We actually have to open back up,"Dr. Hayley Gans, pediatrician and infectious disease specialist at Stanford University andLucile Packard Children's Hospital, said during the FDA advisory meeting. "We can't forever have mitigation — particularly in schools — and children need to return to a more open life, as we all do."As cases continue to drop across the country, mask mandates may be lifted, which could increase the likelihood that — especially unvaccinated — kids could get COVID-19.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

Those workers must show proof of at least one dose of a vaccination to return to work, according to theOct. 20 order.However, last-minute compliance with the order substantially reduced the number of employees who might have been affected, city officials said. De Blasiotweetedon Saturday that 2,300 city workers were immunized on that day alone."More than half of the workers who haven't been vaccinated yet have submitted exemption requests and those requests are being processed," hewroteon Twitter.The eleventh-hour surge brought to 91% the percentage of those vaccinated, up from 86% late last week, de Blasio said.By Sunday, the mayor's office said the rate of vaccination of Emergency Medical Services workers had risen to 87% from 74% on Thursday, while the fire department went to 77% on Friday from 64% the previous day, according to Reuters.The city's fire and police unions have challenged the mandate in court, but the Police Benevolent Association of the City of New York said last week that courts had rejected its requests for an emergency order to halt the mandate.Uniformed Firefighters Association President Andrew Ansbro said the mandate would force dozens of fire companies toshut down. He urged city officials to give the union's members more time to comply with the mandate.Meanwhile, city fire commissioner Daniel Nigro lashed out at some firefighters he said were using "bogus" sick time in response to the mandate deadline on Monday."Irresponsible bogus sick leave by some of our members is creating a danger for New Yorkers and their fellow firefighters," Nigro said in a statement. "They need to return to work or risk the consequences of their actions."The mayor added on Monday, "People get really troubled really quick when people don't show up to do their job if they're not really sick, and we have every reason to believe there's a lot of people out there claiming to be sick when they're not. It's not acceptable."More than 2,000 of the city's 11,000 uniformed firefighters have taken sick days in the week leading up to the mandate going into effect, the fire department's deputy commissioner for public information, Frank Dwyer, hassaid.The vaccination rate on Monday for the New York Police Department, which was reported by de Blasio at 74% on Thursday, was not immediately available, according to Reuters.An earlier version of this story cited Mayor Bill De Blasio as saying that some 9,000 city employees, or about 6% of the 378,000-strong workforce, have been put on unpaid leave. However, the percentage reference has been removed because 9,000 is significantly less than 6% of the workforce.An earlier version of this story cited Mayor Bill De Blasio as saying that some 9,000 city employees, or about 6% of the 378,000-strong workforce, have been put on unpaid leave.

Joe HernandezThe FDA review of Moderna's application for an emergency use authorization of its coronavirus vaccine in adolescents may not be completed before January, the company said.Angela Weiss/AFP via Getty Imageshide captionThe FDA review of Moderna's application for an emergency use authorization of its coronavirus vaccine in adolescents may not be completed before January, the company said.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration will need more time to decide whether to approve Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine for use in children ages 12 to 17, the companyannouncedSunday.The extended timeline is so the FDA can look into reports of a rare side effect — myocarditis, or the inflammation of the heart muscle — in those who've gotten the shot. Moderna said the FDA informed the company of the delay on Friday."The safety of vaccine recipients is of paramount importance to Moderna. The Company is fully committed to working closely with the FDA to support their review and is grateful to the FDA for their diligence," Moderna said in a statement.The government's review of Moderna's application for an emergency use authorization of its coronavirus vaccine in adolescents may not be completed before January, the company said. Moderna requested the FDA's authorization for use in adolescentsin June.The FDA is reviewing "recent international analyses" of the possible side effect, according to Moderna.A recent unpublished study by Sweden's Public Health Agency showed a slightly increased risk of inflammation of the heart muscle andpromptedfour countries to stop giving the shot to young men and boys. The company's vaccine had previously beenapprovedby The European Medicines Agency for use in children between ages 12 and 17.Moderna said it did not yet have access to the recent international analyses. The company estimated that more than 1.5 million adolescents had received its vaccine and said there didn't appear to be an increased risk of myocarditis in those younger than 18.Both the Modern and Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines have been shown to produce myocarditis as a rare side effect. However, viral infections, including COVID-19, also can cause myocarditis. Most children and adolescents who experience myocarditis recover.The FDA recentlyauthorizedthe use of Pfizer-BioNTech's COVID-19 vaccine in children ages 5 to 11 on an emergency basis. Experts on the advisory panel said the benefits of protecting children against COVID-19 outweigh the possible increased risk of the rare side effect.Moderna hasalready been grantedemergency use authorization for its COVID-19 vaccine in adults.The company said Sunday that it would delay applying for emergency authorization for its vaccine to be given to children ages 6 to 11 until the FDA completes its current review.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

While the vaccine has now been authorized for children between ages 5 and 11, it may take several weeks for shots to become widely available.Patrick T. Fallon/AFP via Getty Imageshide captionA syringe is filled with a dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. While the vaccine has now been authorized for children between ages 5 and 11, it may take several weeks for shots to become widely available.Within minutes of the Food and Drug Administration'sdecision Friday to authorize the lower-dose Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccinefor children ages 5 to 11, teams began packing up the vaccines to be shipped. The vials are being packed with syringes, dry ice and tracking labels and are being loaded into shipping containers that were specially designed for the pediatric vaccine.But a top White House official is cautioning that parents shouldn't expect to be able to get their kids vaccinated the very next day if the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends the vaccine, as it is expected to on Tuesday.Patience may be needed, as it could take several days before shots are readily available."We're talking about a specialized vaccine for children," said Jeff Zients, the White House's COVID-19 response coordinator, in an exclusive interview with NPR. "We are hard at work, planning the logistics and making sure that vaccines will be available at tens of thousands of sites that parents and kids know and trust."The process isn't as simple as just opening up appointments at pharmacies, as it was when adult boosters were authorized in recent weeks. Younger children will be getting a smaller dose delivered via smaller needles for smaller arms. It's a different formulation, in different packaging — a new program for a new population that requires greater sensitivity."We urge parents to get ready and make a plan, and the program will be fully up and running the week of November 8th," Zients said.Last week, the administration asked states, pharmacies and pediatricians to put in orders for vaccine doses, and the administration and Pfizer are now working to get the supplies pre-positioned."Our goal is to get as much vaccine as possible pre-positioned, as we await CDC's decision mid next week," Zients said.Zients said vaccines are being shipped to 20,000 locations around the U.S. and the process of packing and shipping will take time. He said pending the CDC's decision, parents should be able to start finding appointments late next week (locations offering vaccines for children will be listed onvaccines.gov)."While we hope to see the first set of kids start to get vaccinated at the end of next week, the bulk of vaccines will be in their locations by the week of Nov. 8," Zients said. "Between now and then, the program will be ramping up to its full strength."In the U.S., 28 million children are ages 5 to 11, and the White House is starting by pushing out 15 million vaccine doses, with more to come. It has enough doses ordered to vaccinate every eligible child in the country, though it doesn't expect every one of them to roll up their sleeves.While some parents will be racing to vaccinate their elementary-age children as fast as possible, the Biden administration is anticipating many others will have questions or not want to go first. Zients says the government will launch a campaign of paid advertising, as well as efforts to get out the word through trusted local leaders and doctors and high-profile nationally known figures.The FDA granted emergency use authorization to the Pfizer vaccine for children ages 5 to 11 based on a study of approximately 4,700 children. The vaccine was found to be safe and 90.7% effective at preventing symptomatic disease.A key part of the Biden administration's plan for vaccinating kids is getting vaccines into places that parents already take their children to for health care: pediatricians and family doctors, children's hospitals and neighborhood pharmacies. There will also be pop-up and mobile clinics and eventually school-based clinics, on evenings or weekends, when families are free.For pediatrician Nicole Baldwin, this moment is both exciting and daunting. "We love these kids and we want to vaccinate them," she said, adding that a pediatrician's office will be a familiar place for young patients who already come in for well visits and other childhood vaccines."Pediatricians' offices are so strapped and overwhelmed right now," Baldwin said, whose practice is in Ohio. "How do we get these patients in? How do we do these clinics? How do we have time to document all of this? So I think that needs to be realized and pediatricians need to be given a little bit of grace."NPR's Allison Aubrey contributed reporting to this story.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

This week, the Food and Drug Administration authorized the use of Pfizer's vaccine in even younger kids — ages 5 to 11.The Food and Drug Administration has authorized a Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for children ages 5 to 11. This lower-dose formulation of the companies' adult vaccine wasfound to be safe and 90.7% effectivein preventing symptomatic COVID-19.The agency acted Friday after a panel of independent scientists advising the FDAstrongly supportedthe authorization on Tuesday. The FDA says the emergency use authorization is based on a study of approximately 4,700 children ages 5 to 11."As a mother and a physician, I know that parents, caregivers, school staff, and children have been waiting for today's authorization. Vaccinating younger children against COVID-19 will bring us closer to returning to a sense of normalcy," said the FDA's acting commissioner, Dr. Janet Woodcock, in a statement.She went on to assure parents that the agency had rigorously evaluated the data and "this vaccine meets our high standards."The next step in the process before the vaccine can be released to pediatricians, pharmacies and other distribution points will be a meeting of anadvisory panelto the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention next Tuesday.Depending on the outcome of that committee's deliberations, the CDC's director, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, would then have the final say on whether the vaccine can be used and in what circumstances.Once Walensky weighs in, children in this age group could, conceivably,begin to receive their first shot in early November.A dose of the Pfizer vaccine for young children contains one-third the amount of active ingredient used in the vaccine for those 12 years old and up. Children would receive a second dose 21 days or more after their first shot.The vaccine also differs from the existing formulation that teens and adults have been gettingin that it can be stored in a refrigerator for up to 10 weeks — making it easier for private medical offices, schools and other locations to keep and administer the vaccine.Children ages 5 to 11 have accounted for approximately 9% of reported COVID-19 cases in the U.S. overall and currently account for approximately 40% of pediatric COVID-19 cases, according toDr. Doran Fink, clinical deputy director of the FDA's Division of Vaccines and Related Products Applications. Currently, he says, the case rate of COVID-19among children ages 5 to 11 is "near the highest" of any age group.Unvaccinated children who get COVID-19 can develop a serious complication calledmultisystem inflammatory syndrome, or MIS-C. More than 5,000 children have gotten the condition so far, according to Dr. Fiona Havers, a medical officer at the CDC who presented data this week to the FDA committee.In deliberations at Tuesday's advisory panel, scientists and clinicians discussed the risks of side effects from the vaccine. Myocarditis and pericarditis — which can occur after viral infections, including COVID-19 — have been seen as rare side effects after vaccination with the two mRNA vaccines, Pfizer and Moderna,especially among young men.In the Pfizer-BioNTech study submitted to the FDA, there were no cases of myocarditis in the children studied. However, given that the highest risk for these rare side effects is among teen males, the agency assessed the risks and benefits of vaccinating younger children and concluded that the benefits of preventing hospitalization from COVID-19 outweigh the possible risks of the side effects.During Tuesday's advisory panel discussion, Capt. Amanda Cohn, a physician and medical officer with the CDC and also a voting member of the FDA committee, said that vaccinating young children against COVID-19 can save lives and keep kids out of the hospital."We have incredible safety systems in place to monitor for the potential for myocarditis in this age group, and we can respond quickly," she said. "To me, the question is pretty clear. We don't want children to be dying of COVID, even if it is far fewer children than adults, and we don't want them in the ICU."Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

Like many of its neighbors, Tonga's isolation has helped keep it safe but it faces big challenges should the virus take hold due to its under-resourced health system.The nearby nation of Fiji avoided significant outbreaks until April, when the delta variant ripped through the island chain, infecting more than 50,000 people and killing at least 673.Tonga's Prime Minister Pohiva Tu'i'onetoa said in a radio address that the traveler was among 215 passengers who had arrived on a flight from the New Zealand city of Christchurch on Wednesday and had been isolating at a quarantine hotel.A pig wonders around a house in Nuku'alofa, Tonga, on April 7, 2019.

Tonga on Friday reported its first-ever case of COVID-19 after a returning resident caught the virus while in New Zealand.The prime minister planned on Monday to make an announcement about any future lockdowns, according to news website Matangi Tonga.Christchurch had been free from the virus for months until this week, when four community cases were reported after a returning resident caught the virus while in Auckland, where an outbreak has been growing since August.New Zealand health officials said the traveler to Tonga was fully vaccinated with the Pfizer vaccine and had returned a negative test before leaving for Tonga. The officials said they would be working with their Tongan counterparts to confirm the case and provide more details in the coming days.Tongan Health Ministry chief executive Dr. Siale 'Akau'ola said it was unfortunate the plane had already left Christchurch before the news came of the community cases there, Matangi Tonga reported.'Akau'ola said all frontline workers including health staff, police officers and airport staff who were on duty when the plane arrived had also been put into quarantine after the positive case was confirmed. He added that all those working near the flight had been vaccinated.Located northeast of New Zealand, Tonga is home to about 106,000 people. About 31% of Tongans are fully vaccinated and 48% have had at least one dose, according to research group Our World in Data.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Michaeleen DoucleffBack in the 1980s, scientists in the U.K. performed an experiment that — at first glance — sounds unethical. "Volunteers came into the lab, and someone squirted virus up their nose," says computational biologist Jennie Lavine.The researchers took a liquid packed with coronavirus particles and intentionally tried to make 15 volunteers sick.Ten people got infected. The other five fought off the virus, saysLavine, who's now at thebiotechnology company Kariusbut was at Emory University when she spoke to NPR.Then the researchers waited a year and repeated the experiment. They wondered: Did getting sick from the coronavirus the first time protect people from the second exposure a year later? Or could people get reinfected a year later?Now, this coronavirus injected up the volunteers' noses wasn't SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes the disease COVID-19, Lavine is quick to point out. "No. No. Nobody got very sick. I think they measured disease severity by how many tissue boxes a person used. The experiment was performed with all of the proper ethical considerations."The researchers were studying another coronavirus, called 229E, that causes only a mild cold in humans. But the results of thatexperimentoffer some intriguing insights into the possible endgame of the COVID-19 pandemic. After this delta-variant surge wanes this winter, as scientistsforecast, what's next? Will the virus come back next year? And the year after that?When COVID-19 erupted worldwide, there was some hope we could put the genie back into the bottle, so to speak. That is, the world could completely wipe out the virus from the human population as it did for the first SARS coronavirus back in 2003.But as the current virus spread rapidly from continent to continent and cases exploded in every nook and cranny, the hope shifted to local eradication. Perhaps some regions could reach herd immunity via exposure and vaccinations and thus push out the virus from their communities and keep it out with travel restrictions and immunization requirements."It's like, OK, if we're not going to be able to fully eliminate SARS-CoV-2 from the world," Lavine says, "then maybe we would achieve local eradication, like we do for measles or polio."For that to be possible, the virus must be stable, says virologistPaul Bieniasz, of Rockefeller University. Its genetic sequence can't mutate or change over time; that way, the vaccine's protection can last for a long time. "If you have a measles infection or a course of the vaccine, you have essentially lifelong protection," he says, because that virus doesn't evolve much.But not all viruses are like that. For instance, influenza viruses mutate really rapidly, and those mutations can decrease a vaccine's effectiveness. That's one reason you can get reinfected with the flu over and over again — "and why we have to update vaccines every year," says molecular biologistKathryn Kistler, of the University of Washington, in Seattle. "The virus is evolving so much that our immune system no longer recognizes it."So whether communities can locally eradicate SARS-CoV-2 depends largely on how fast its genetic sequence is changing. At the beginning of the pandemic, the virus seemed to look more like the measles than the flu. The general belief among the scientific community was that the SARS-CoV-2 virus wouldn't change much over time.Six months into the pandemic, the virus seemed to be following the predicted course. "To date, there have been very few mutations observed," molecular biologistPeter Thielenat Johns Hopkins University told NPR in June 2020 for astorywith the headline: "This Coronavirus Doesn't Change Quickly, And That's Good News For Vaccine Makers."Then in December 2020, right around the holidays, SARS-CoV-2 shifted course, drastically.Scientists in South Africa announced that they had detected a mutant version of the virus that seemed capable of reinfecting people — that is, avoiding the immune response created by a previous infection. A few weeks later, scientists in the U.K. identified a rapidly spreading mutant that looked to be about 50% more transmissible than the original versions of the virus. A few weeks later, another mutant cropped up in Brazil, causing a massive second surge then.So all of a sudden, it looked like SARS-CoV-2 not only was mutating but was doing so quite rapidly. Last month, Kistler and her colleagues at the University of Washingtonpublisheda new metric to measure how quickly SARS-CoV-2 is evolving as it adapts to living inside humans. When Kistler first saw the value, she was shocked. "SARS-CoV-2's rate of adaptation is remarkably high right now," she says, "like roughly four times higher for SARS-CoV-2 than it is for seasonal flu."Remember, the flu changes so fast that people can be vulnerable to it each year."I don't think SARS-CoV-2 will stop adapting," Kistler says. "It may slow down, but viruses that evolve adaptively tend to keep doing that. They don't tend to hit the limit of evolution."This fast evolution has immense implications, many scientists say. It essentially dashes the hopes of eradicating SARS-CoV-2 in the U.S. or even in smaller communities. As with the flu, the coronavirus will likely be able to reinfect people over and over again. It will keep returning year after year."Eventually everyone will be exposed to SARS-CoV-2," says Dr.Abraar Karan, who's an infectious disease specialist at Stanford University. "It's a matter of whether you're exposed when you're fully vaccinated or when you're not vaccinated."On the surface, these findings sound like horrible news. It sounds like the COVID-19 pandemic — along with the masks, physical distancing and quarantining — will never go away.But Karan doesn't believe that will be the case. Although he predicts that SARS-CoV-2 will circulate in the U.S. indefinitely, he says that COVID-19, the dreadful disease, as we now know it, will likely go away."When you're fully vaccinated [or been exposed several times], you're dealing with a very, very different disease and a very different process," Karan says. In fact, you're likely dealing with a disease that many of us have already had, perhaps dozens of times, in our lifetimes.This might come as a surprise, but the U.S. has dealt with many — and massive — coronavirus outbreaks before the COVID-19 pandemic.Besides SARS-CoV-2, there are four other coronaviruses in widespread circulation: NL63, 229E, OC43 and HKU1. The first two have likely beeninfecting peoplefor centuries, and the latter two for decades, perhaps longer. They're related to SARS-CoV-2 but are not the same.Each year, one or more of these other coronaviruses sweeps through the U.S. — in schools, day care centers, churches and offices — and makes people sick. Many, many people. These coronaviruses are so common that by the time a child starts kindergarten, the youngster has likely been infected with all four of them.VirologistRachel Eguiaof the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle and her colleagues have been studying one of these coronaviruses."So we've been studying strains of a coronavirus from 1984, 1992, 2001, 2008 and 2016," says Eguia. She wanted to see if people could get reinfected every eight years or so.Here's the sneaky thing about these coronaviruses: Just because you caught one of them last year doesn't mean you're protected from that same coronavirus infection the next year.Remember that British experiment described at the beginning of this piece, in which volunteers had virus particles injected up their noses, not just once but twice? In that study, the researchers also measured people's antibodies in their blood before the second exposure to the virus. They found that having antibodies against that specific virus didn't necessarily protect people from being infected a second time — but there was a benefit nonetheless. Having higher antibody levels prevented people from developing symptoms altogether and shortened the time they spread the virus."Several studies suggest that every few years you're probably able to get reinfected with these coronaviruses," Eguia says. A study,publishedlast year inNature Medicine, found that immunity to these seasonal coronaviruses lasts less than 12 months. Throughout a person's lifetime, they've likely caught them several dozen times.Yet nobody notices them. We catch these coronaviruses, and "normal" life goes on. Schools and churches stay open. People gather inside bars and clubs. House parties continue. Why? Because these coronaviruses typicallycauseonly colds. They give you the sniffles, a cough, some sneezing, congestion, maybe a low-grade fever. The illness is generally milder than the flu and resolves on its own in a week or so.Together, these coronaviruses cause about 10% to 30% of all colds in adults, studies havefound. So in many ways, these coronaviruses are part of modern life. We simply coexist with them, without much fanfare.Could the same be true for SARS-CoV-2?Some scientists are starting to think that eventually COVID-19 could turn into a disease that looks more similar to those from these other coronaviruses — in other words, a mild flu-like illness."That's what our computer models predict," says Lavine, the computational biologist at Karius. For the past year and half, she and her colleagues have combined what's known about the four other seasonal coronaviruses to try to forecast what SARS-CoV-2 will do two, five and even 10 years from now. Theypublishedtheir findings in the journalSciencethis past February.For the new virus to turn into a mild cold, she says, two conditions need to be met. First, immune protection against severe disease has to persist. "Being infected a few times or having a few doses of the vaccine needs to provide really long-lasting immunity against severe disease," she says. It doesn't have to prevent transmission or a mild disease. But it has to keep you from being hospitalized.With the vaccine, so far immunity looks like it's holding up for at least six months or so for healthy adults, saysRustom Antia, a colleague of Lavine's at Emory. But right now it's unclear how long that critical immunity will last for people more at risk for severe disease."We don't know how it will hold up for older individuals, above 60 or so. We don't know how many doses of the vaccine will be needed to build up our immunity so that when we do get infected naturally, it's not severe."But if the vaccine — and/or natural exposure — does provide long-lasting immunity for everyone, then over time the vast majority of the population will eventually be protected against severe COVID-19. That would leave only one population unexposed and vulnerable: brand-new people — newborns.And that brings us to the second condition required for SARS-CoV-2 to become a seasonal cold: The virus has to continue to be relatively mild in kids.Although children and babies can, in rare cases, experience dangerous complications, in general COVID-19 poses low risk to young children. Although the reason for this lower risk is unknown, one study,publishedin August, showed children's immune cells in their noses can more quickly detect SARS-Cov-2 than the corresponding cells in adults — and take action to ward it off. The data suggest that "immune cells of the upper airways (nose) of children are pre-activated and primed for virus sensing," the authors wrote.As long as SARS-CoV-2 continues to be a low risk in children — that is, as long as a new variant that's dangerous to kids doesn't emerge — then they can get infected early on when they're young, build up their immunity to the virus and have protection from severe disease as adults. So in theory, everyone around the world would eventually be protected from the horrible disease that COVID-19 can become.Now, the buildup of this immunity across a whole population can take time — perhaps years. That's why, Antia says, it's so important for people to get vaccinated, because the faster everyone is protected against severe disease, the faster COVID-19 could transform from a disease that causes great fear to a disease that fades into the background of our lives.Of course, as with all predictions about viruses, this one could be completely wrong. Over the past year and a half, SARS-CoV-2 has surprised even the smartest — and most skeptical — scientists. But the more that researchers learn about our immune response to SARS-CoV-2, says Bieniasz, the Rockefeller University virologist, the more optimistic he becomes that this endgame scenario (or a variation of it) will come true. "Based on what we're finding, it does look like the immune system is eventually going to have the edge over this virus."Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

According to a study released in The Lancet Global Health, a cheap antidepressant known as fluvoxamine reduced the need for hospitalization among high-risk adults with COVID-19.A cheap antidepressant reduced the need for hospitalization among high-risk adults with COVID-19 in a study hunting for existing drugs that could be repurposed to treat coronavirus.Researchers tested the pill used for depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder because it was known to reduce inflammation and looked promising in smaller studies.They've shared the results with the U.S. National Institutes of Health, which publishes treatment guidelines, and they hope for a World Health Organization recommendation."If WHO recommends this, you will see it widely taken up," said study co-author Dr. Edward Mills of McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, adding that many poor nations have the drug readily available. "We hope it will lead to a lot of lives saved."The pill, called fluvoxamine, would cost $4 for a course of COVID-19 treatment. By comparison, antibody IV treatments cost about $2,000 and Merck's experimental antiviral pill for COVID-19 is about $700 per course. Some experts predict various treatments eventually will be used in combination to fight the coronavirus.Researchers tested the antidepressant in nearly 1,500 Brazilians recently infected with coronavirus who were at risk of severe illness because of other health problems, such as diabetes. About half took the antidepressant at home for 10 days, the rest got dummy pills. They were tracked for four weeks to see who landed in the hospital or spent extended time in an emergency room when hospitals were full.In the group that took the drug, 11% needed hospitalization or an extended ER stay, compared to 16% of those on dummy pills.The results, published Wednesdayin the journal Lancet Global Health, were so strong that independent experts monitoring the study recommended stopping it early because the results were clear.Questions remain about the best dosing, whether lower risk patients might also benefit and whether the pill should be combined with other treatments.The larger project looked at eight existing drugs to see if they could work against the pandemic virus. The project is still testing a hepatitis drug, but all the others — including metformin, hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin — haven't panned out.The cheap generic and Merck's COVID-19 pill work in different ways and "may be complementary," said Dr. Paul Sax of Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, who was not involved in the study. Earlier this month, Merck asked regulators in the U.S. and Europe to authorize its antiviral pill.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

Federal agencies are considering whether to start giving the vaccine to children ages 5 to 11 in the near future.Updated Nov. 2, 8:10 p.m. ETChildren as young as 5 will be able to get vaccinated against COVID-19 in the U.S. within the next several days.While some parentsaren't sure how they feelabout this, others are waiting eagerly for a chance to protect their children from COVID-19.But federal agencies can't be rushed. Here's what has to happen before the Pfizer-BioNTech shots can start going into kids' arms.Loading...Currently, Pfizer is the furthest along in this process, but Moderna has shared some promisingresults from its vaccine trial with this age group, and Johnson & Johnson is expected to begin vaccine trials for young kids in the future as well. Here are more details on what the regulatory process entails and how it is going for the Pfizer vaccine.Pfizer and BioNTech have completed athree-phase clinical trialin children 5 to 11 years old. The companies submitted all of the data from that trial and an application for emergency use authorization to the Food and Drug Administrationon Oct. 7.The main study included 2,250 kids and found that the lower-dose version of the vaccine was 90.7% effective in preventing symptomatic COVID-19. It was given as a series of two shots, 21 days apart, and the dose was 10 micrograms, a third of the dose given to adults and teenagers.No serious side effects such asheart inflammationwere reported, although with only a few thousand children included in the research, that sort of rare problem wouldn't necessarily be detected.This week, on Oct. 26, a panel of outside scientists consideredPfizer's safety and efficacy data, along with ananalysis from FDA scientistson the risks and benefits of the vaccine in different pandemic scenarios.After some lively discussion, thegroup overwhelmingly voted yes, that the benefits of the Pfizer vaccine outweigh the risks for use in this age group.Next, the FDA — the agency itself — considered the advisers' vote on Pfizer's smaller-dose shot for kids. On Friday, FDA officials decided to extend theemergency use authorizationfor Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine to younger kids. Acting commissioner Dr. Janet Woodcock, assured parents in a statement that the agency had rigorously evaluated the data and "this vaccine meets our high standards."But wait, there's more. Yet another federal health agency and its advisers had to weigh in before the shots can become available — this time, it's the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.You can think of it like this: When it comes to vaccines, the FDA is in charge of thewhat, and the CDC is in charge of thewho.The CDC's advisory group met Tuesday and voted to recommend the vaccine for all children in the 5-11 age group. Dr. Amanda Cohn served until recently as the executive secretary for the CDC's vaccine advisory group, and she's a voting member of the FDA's vaccine advisory group, explained the difference between the two federal advisory groups that weigh in on these kinds of decisions:The FDA decides whether a vaccine (or other product) is safe and effective, she explained at theFDA advisory meeting this week. The CDC's group then considers and votes on "who would benefit from the vaccine and who should get vaccinated." Their deliberations include factors such as equity, feasibility and the "potential impact of recommendations on a population," she said.When they vote, the CDC's advisers could follow the FDA's lead in their recommendations, or they could "make more focused or nuanced recommendations," Cohn said. For instance, they could have recommended it for a certain subgroup, like children with underlying conditions or those who haven't had a prior coronavirus infection.Even then, a vote from the CDC's advisers isn't an official recommendation — that comes from the CDC's director, Dr. Rochelle Walensky. On Tuesday night she greenlit the advisers' recommendation. If she had chosen to, she could have changed the recommendation from what the committee voted on —as she did with boosters— but she followed their lead and recommended them to all kids aged 5-11.Only after the CDC director issues an official recommendation can shots get distributed to pediatricians and pharmacies around the country.Experts have been reassuring the public that the rollout of this new lower-dose vaccine won't be a repeat of thedisarray of the original COVID-19 vaccine rolloutlast winter."We will be ready immediately following FDA and CDC's decisions so that parents can get their kids vaccinated quickly, easily and conveniently," Jeffrey Zients, the White House's COVID-19 response coordinator, said at anews conference Wednesday.The immunization managers planning the rollout in each state feel much more ready this time, says Claire Hannan, executive director of theAssociation of Immunization Managers."We have plenty of vaccine, and I think that we're very well prepared," she says.Still, she warns that parents shouldn't expect that they'll be able to get their kid vaccinated the instant the regulatory hurdles are cleared. There will be challenges getting the vaccine to the right providers to meet the demand.Experts suggest looking out for guidance from your child's pediatrician and school. Parents will also be able to find pharmacies with pediatric COVID-19 shots in stock atvaccines.gov, a CDC websitelaunched in Februaryto help people who want COVID-19 vaccines figure out where to go.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Charles MaynesA man wearing a face mask speaks on his phone in central Moscow on Wednesday.Yuri Kadobnov/AFP via Getty Imageshide captionA man wearing a face mask speaks on his phone in central Moscow on Wednesday.MOSCOW — Russia's capital entered a 10-day partial lockdown on Thursday — as the rest of Russia braced for a series of COVID-19 restrictions aimed at stemming the spread of a virus that has set, and continuously reset, records over the past month for daily fatalities and infections.On Thursday, the government's coronavirus task force reported the latest grim milestone — a record-high 40,096 infections and 1,159 deaths in the past 24 hours alone.The Kremlin openly blames the unprecedented surge on Russians' continued reluctance to vaccinate. Despite widespread access to Russia's Sputnik V for most of this year, just over a third of the country is fully vaccinated."These are intelligent people with a good education. I can't understand what's going on," said a clearly exasperated President Vladimir Putin, commenting on the growing crisis last week. "We have a reliable and efficient vaccine. I want to emphasize again, there are only two choices: get sick or get vaccinated."Russian officials have registered more than 235,000 deaths since the start of the pandemic — the highest number in Europe — even as independent analysts have cited evidence that suggests the true numbermay be much higher.Yet it's a surge from the delta strain of the virus that has authorities suddenly reintroducing restrictions, after repeated assurances that the pandemic was well under control.With health officials warning that existing COVID wards were near capacity, Putin announced last week a nationwide "non-working week" from Oct. 30 through Nov. 7. He has delegated authority to regional governors to implement additional restrictions to stop the virus' spread.The result has been a patchwork of measures rippling across the country.In Stavropol, in Russia's south, police erected checkpoints demanding that Russians seeking last-minute vacations provide proof of vaccination for entry.In Khakassia, a republic in eastern Siberia, authorities have imposed a 10 p.m. curfew and put a halt to all public transport."There's not much to do here at night anyway," says Alexei Kirichenko, an independent journalist in Khakassia's main city of Abakan. "But the same people who complain about the buses not working now are the same ones who never wore masks to begin with. Of course no one likes the restrictions."Last call at a Moscow bar on Wednesday night. The city has shut down most service industry businesses amid a record surge in coronavirus infections and deaths.Charles Maynes/NPRhide captionIn Moscow, a web of new lockdown measures brought an abrupt end to a sense of normalcy that had settled over the capital in the past few months.Under the order of Mayor Sergei Sobyanin, unvaccinated seniors are required to stay at home over the next four months. Schools are shuttered. Offices have sent workers home. The metro stands largely empty.Meanwhile, city restaurants, bars, cafes, salons, gyms, movie theaters, and — for reasons few could fathom — car repair shops are closed to customers as of midnight Wednesday.Around the city, there is a sense that small businesses are taking the brunt of the government lockdown, just as they did in June 2020 — when the Kremlin ordered businesses shuttered, providing little in the way of bailout funds offered to larger state companies. Many smaller shops closed for good."If they keep us shut for months like the last lockdown, we're done for," says Anna Alekseeva, 25, who works at one of a slew of small craft beer bars that have popped up in Moscow in recent years. "This isn't Europe or America. The government here doesn't care about small business at all."Moscow theaters and museums remain among the few public spaces still open to visitors — albeit at 50% capacity and with proof of vaccination.That includes "Life with Viruses," a new exhibition at the Exhibition of Achievements of National Economy park, known as VDNKh, in Moscow. The exhibition is dedicated to the history of the interplay between humans, viruses and medicine.Visitors take in a tour of the "Life with Viruses" exhibit in Moscow. As of Thursday, the museum is one of few public spaces available to vaccinated Russians.Charles Maynes/NPRhide captionA mannequin of a doctor wearing a beak as part of his costume from the Middle Ages'Black Deathera greets visitors.

"We don't want to scare anyone. Our goal is to inform. The more we understand what we're dealing with, the better chance have of coming up with ways to defend ourselves."Rikov notes the exhibit has proved popular with once-skeptical government health officials looking to reboot Russia's vaccination efforts.The museum plans to take a "light version" on the road to cities across the country beginning this winter."It's a more effective way to educate people — have them learn and share what they know — than some big television propaganda campaign across the country," he says.Sergei Rikov, curator of the exhibit "Life with Viruses" in Moscow, poses before a model of the coronavirus. Rikov argues the exhibit can play a role in educating Russians about the coronavirus — and the need to vaccinate.Charles Maynes/NPRhide captionRikov and others hoping to educate Russians on the pandemic will likely face an uphill battle. Health experts say that Russia's current COVID woes are due at least in part to the Kremlin's own propaganda machine. Conspiracy-minded state media has fed Russians a steady diet of distrust of vaccines, science and truth itself."At the beginning of the pandemic, the media was saying that the virus wasn't that terrifying or that Western vaccines were dangerous," says Georgii Bazykin, a biologist at the Skolkovo Institute in Moscow who has studied the epidemiology of the coronavirus in Russia."Well, people aren't dumb. If they hear that Pfizer or Moderna are bad, then it makes sense that our Sputnik [vaccine] is bad too. It played a cruel joke on our vaccination efforts," he says."There's so much information these days that we don't know what to think anymore. Is it a conspiracy or not?" says Elena, a social worker in Moscow who declined to give her last name name, saying she was not authorized to speak to the press. "I just want life to go back to normal."But not everyone sees the government's vaccination efforts so far as a failure."A third of Russians vaccinating isn't a bad result at all," says Mikhail Parfeonov, a father of two visiting Moscow from Kirov in central Russia. "What can I say? People don't believe the government. It's Russia. Get used to it."Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Jaclyn DiazUniformed Firefighters Association President Andrew Ansbro speaks during a protest outside the Gracie Mansion against the coming COVID-19 vaccine mandate for city workers on Thursday in New York.Jeenah Moon/APhide captionUniformed Firefighters Association President Andrew Ansbro speaks during a protest outside the Gracie Mansion against the coming COVID-19 vaccine mandate for city workers on Thursday in New York.New York City firefighters took their protests over the city's COVID-19 vaccine mandates to the residence of Mayor Bill de Blasio on Thursday.The mayor approved a vaccine mandate that, beginning Nov. 1, forces all public employees in the city to get a coronavirus vaccine or risk losing their jobs. Most city workers need to show proof that they have received at least one dose of vaccine by 5 p.m. Friday."This is a personal choice everyone wants to make for themselves," Andrew Ansbro, president of the Uniformed Firefighters Association,told Fox Newsearlier. He said the union plans to file a lawsuit over the mandate.Ansbro, who said he is vaccinated himself, said that up to 45% of the New York City's Fire Department could lose their jobs over the vaccine mandate.He estimated that around 70% of the department's workers contracted the coronavirus during the pandemic. He said that with more than half of the department's firefighters vaccinated and a large portion having had the virus before, that they "are covered" and protected from the coronavirus.All public employees in the city are required to have at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine by 5 p.m. on Friday.Jeenah Moon/APhide captionAll public employees in the city are required to have at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine by 5 p.m. on Friday.Opposition to the city's vaccine mandates extends beyond the firefighters.Over the weekend,thousands of New York City employees took to the streets in protest.Teachers, police and other public employees in Chicago, Los Angeles and Washington arefighting similar battlesover these rules.This is all despite statistics showing that the coronavirus has been the leading cause of death for police officers during the pandemic.Ansbro has blamed de Blasio for what may turn out to be a massive shortage of first responders."We've been here every day of the pandemic and we will still be here on Nov. 1,"Ansbro told a local CBS affiliate this weekend."It'll be the mayor that separates you from New York City residents and what happens to them will be on him, and not on us."The mayor said the city has backup plans to ensure city services continue, including using overtime if staffing shortages occur.A similar lawsuit submitted by the city's police department failed earlier this week. A state judge denied the New York City Police Benevolent Association's request for a temporary ban on the implementation of the mandate for police officers.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

The spread of the delta variant led to sharply slower economic growth in the July-to-September quarter.Kena Betancur/AFP via Getty Imageshide captionA sign asking patrons to wear a mask is seen at the entrance of a restaurant in New York City on Aug. 3. The spread of the delta variant led to sharply slower economic growth in the July-to-September quarter.On the Fourth of July, the U.S. economy looked ready to skyrocket."We're seeing record job creation and record economic growth," President Biden said then as he encouraged Americans to celebrate their newfound independence from the coronavirus pandemic.By Labor Day, however, the economy looked more like a dud, its midsummer sparkle smothered by a wave of delta variant infections and persistent supply chain problems.The nation's gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of just 2% in the third quarter,the Commerce Department said Thursday— a sharp slowdown from the 6.7% pace in the spring quarter.Loading...But there's room for hope: The health outlook is improving, and forecasters believe it could set up the economy for stronger growth in the last three months of the year."We've lost a step here, but I think we're going to get a lot of steps back pretty quickly," says Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. "This highlights how tethered the economy is to the pandemic. It's still driving the economic train."The pandemic has had an unprecedented impact across the economy, and few periods have illustrated its ups and downs as dramatically as the slowdown in late summer and early fall.Heading into July, the economic train was chugging along at a healthy clip, and that rapid GDP growth was expected to continue."It looked like the recovery could only get stronger," recalls Ben Herzon, an economist with the forecasting firm IHS Markit. "Coronavirus case counts were low and declining. People were making plans to go back to work."President Biden and first lady Jill Biden, along with other Biden family members, pose for a selfie as they watch a fireworks display during a barbecue event at the White House on July 4.

Hopes about the economy on Independence Day were dashed by the spread of the delta variant and supply chain woes.Restaurants and airlines that were pummeled by the pandemic in 2020 hoped to cash in, as Americans dined out and booked overdue vacations.Employers addedmore than a million jobs in July, including 57,000 in manufacturing."Everybody was looking at this pent-up demand coming in and chasing business," says John Gessert, who runs a toy manufacturing company in Walled Lake, Mich.It didn't last. Job growthslowed by nearly two-thirdsin August.September's job gains were smallerstill.There's no mystery about why a soaring economy suddenly slumped."What happened was, delta happened," Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told reporters last month.As infections, hospitalizations and deaths tied to the coronavirus variant mounted in late July and August, people spent less money on in-person services and many shelved plans to go back to work."Delta did a lot of damage," says Zandi. "It made consumers more cautious, so travel fell off. People went to restaurants less often. It rescrambled the global supply chains."A coronavirus pop-up testing site stands on a Manhattan street in New York City on Oct. 26.

Delta variant infections are decreasing, spurring hopes for an economic recovery in the last three months of 2021.In tourist-dependent Las Vegas, visitor traffic dropped 9.2% between July and August and another 2.1% in September."It definitely would have been a lot more people here if it wasn't for the delta variant," says Precious Briggs, an unemployed server who's waiting to be called back to work at the Palace Station casino.While some businesses were hurting for customers, others struggled to find workers. Millions of potential employees were either out sick with COVID-19, staying home for fear of catching it or busy caring for loved ones who were sick."The challenge for us has been getting enough drivers," says Angela Eicher of the Nitetrain Coach Company, which provides bus transportation for touring musicians. "We have had a couple of drivers contract COVID while they were out on the road. We've had a couple contract COVID while they were at home."Gessert's toy company, which typically employs about 300 people in Michigan and Mississippi, has been limping along with 230."We've had to limit molding hours because we don't have enough people to put the parts together," Gessert says.The lack of workers has contributed to — and been compounded by — a shortage of materials.The plastic resin that Gessert's company uses to make toys has doubled in price, and even cardboard packaging has sometimes been hard to come by."What used to take a week now takes two to three weeks," Gessert says. "That's the frustrating thing. We could have done a lot more business had plastic not gotten so expensive and had we been able to hire people."The Tackle Box 2 restaurant and boat ramp on Ohio's Sandusky River had plenty of traffic during the summer. But keeping customers fed was a challenge."Onion rings. Cheese sticks. There's stuff I just can't get," says Sereta Stephens, whose father started the restaurant 30 years ago. "If I order it today, it might be here next week or it might be in two weeks."The Commerce Department says all of the slowdown in GDP growth during the quarter can be tied to consumer spending. Consumers' demand for services slowed during the quarter while spending on goods actually declined, largely as a result of shortages and delivery delays."It's great to say that people have money to spend. But unless they have things to spend it on, it doesn't really translate back to the economy," says chief economist Nela Richardson of the payroll processing company ADP.A truck drives past cargo containers stacked at the Port of Los Angeles, the nation's busiest container port, on Oct. 15.

Supply chain woes are expected to persist well into next year.While third-quarter growth is disappointing, forecasters expect GDP growth to pick up in the final months of the year.Coronavirus infections have droppednearly 60% since early September. And as the health outlook improves, restaurant dining, air travel and in-person entertainment have already started to rebound.Winter is typically a slow season for touring musicians, but Nitetrain's bus schedule is booked solid for November."People are eager to go out and see some live music," Eicher says. "Also, I think the musicians are ready to be out playing live music again in front of crowds."Herzon thinks the economy will grow at an annual rate of nearly 5% during the last three months of the year — slower than in the spring but much stronger than during the late-summer bust."Consumers are spending, and that's a good sign," Herzon says. "As long as businesses can learn to manage their supply issues, then growth can pick up."The strength of the recovery will also depend on how quickly would-be workers — some of whom were sidelined by the delta wave — decide it's safe to reenter the workforce."I think the biggest question out there right now is, where are all these missing workers?" asks Richardson. "How long will they stay missing, and what will entice them to come back to the labor market?"She expects stronger job gains this winter than in August or September but doubts employers will add a million jobs a month, as they did in July."We'll likely see progress, but it will be continued choppy progress. And it will be dependent on the containment of the virus," Richardson says. "People's confidence in the economy right now is tied to health conditions."Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Scott NeumanBrazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, seen during a news conference in Brasilia last week, has insisted that he is innocent of the charges proposed against him.Evaristo Sa/AFP via Getty Imageshide captionBrazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, seen during a news conference in Brasilia last week, has insisted that he is innocent of the charges proposed against him.Brazil's Senate has voted to recommend charging President Jair Bolsonaro with "crimes against humanity" over his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has killed more than 600,000 people across the country.That charge and several others were backed by lawmakers and forwarded for possible indictment. They come at the conclusion of asix-month investigationof the government's handling of the pandemic. The president has insisted that he is innocent, calling the panel's work a"joke,"and it appeared unlikely that the country's prosecutor-general, Augusto Aras — a Bolsonaro appointee — will take up the recommendation.The 11-member Senate panel voted 7-4 on Tuesday torecommend the charges, which also include inciting an epidemic, as well as violating health protocols, falsification of private documents, irregular use of public funds, violation of social rights and breach of presidential decorum, according to The Associated Press."The chaos of Jair Bolsonaro's government will enter history as the lowest level of human destitution," Sen. Renan Calheiros said, according toReuters. Brazil, with a population of about 213 million, has recorded more than 606,000 deaths from COVID-19 —second only to the U.S.As the toll has risen, Bolsonaro's popularity has waned. His management of the crisis has frequently appearedcavalier and dismissive, with his repeated comparisons of the deadly virus to the flu and an insistence that claims of its danger are "exaggerated." The president has also derided governors and mayors as "criminals" for imposing lockdowns and restrictions to control the spread of the virus.Like former U.S. President Donald Trump,Bolsonaro contracted COVID-19, but subsequently recovered. Also like Trump, he touted an unproven remedy,hydroxychloroquine, as a prophylactic and treatment for the virus.One of the charges forward by the Senate panel is "charlatanism" for Bolsonaro's promotion of the dubious drug.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Patrick JarenwattananonAyen BiorSarah HandelA vendor walks through Old San Juan, Puerto Rico, in March.Spencer Platt/Getty Imageshide captionA vendor walks through Old San Juan, Puerto Rico, in March.The highest rate of COVID-19 vaccination in the U.S. is not in a liberal-leaning Northeastern or West Coast state.It's in Puerto Rico, wheremore than 73% of the total population is fully vaccinated. The U.S. national average is just over 57%.The high vaccination rate stands in contrast toPuerto Rico's initial vulnerability to the coronavirus. Four years after Hurricane Maria destroyed the electricity grid, power outages still occur regularly. Many municipalities face a shortage of health care facilities and workers.The U.S. territory responded with some of the strictest pandemic measures in the country, including nonessential-business closures, stay-at-home orders and mask mandates.Mónica Feliú-Mójer, the director of communications and science outreach for the nonprofit organization Ciencia Puerto Rico, says that people responded pretty well to the measures."There was so much concern with, when the pandemic started, that we have such a fragile health care system," she told NPR's Audie Cornish onAll Things Considered.San Juan's convention center hosted Puerto Rico's first mass COVID-19 vaccination event on March 31.Ricardo Arduengo/AFP via Getty Imageshide captionSan Juan's convention center hosted Puerto Rico's first mass COVID-19 vaccination event on March 31."There's a lot of concern that the pandemic could cause it to collapse. So I think everyone pretty much rallied to do what needed to be done so that we could keep that health care system from collapsing and, you know, from having the worst happen in Puerto Rico."The high vaccination rate also correlates with one of the country's lowest coronavirus community transmission rates, according todata from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and one of the country's lowest test positivity rates, hovering around 2%.The head of the scientific coalition advising Puerto Rico on COVID-19 (and the founder of Ciencia Puerto Rico), Daniel Colón-Ramos, says this correlation is not a coincidence."It represents a lot of saved lives,"Colón-Ramos told CNN."It's really about the fact there are hundreds of people — if not thousands — right now walking around somewhere in Puerto Rico and they wouldn't be there if it wasn't for these efforts."Feliú-Mójer says one reason for the success with vaccination is a difference in political culture compared with the mainland United States. In the continental U.S., Republicans have consistently foughtmask-wearing rulesandvaccine mandates, citing personal liberty."We don't see that correlation between political ideologies and people's willingness to get vaccinated or use masks," she said. "It's not like the issue of COVID and vaccination hasn't been politicized. It's just been politicized in a different way, not in terms of identities or ideologies, political ideologies."While Feliú-Mójer notes that there are small but vocal anti-vaccine groups in Puerto Rico, she also points to a "really good" historical acceptance of vaccines. She says a key is engaging people on their values, beliefs or identities rather than allowing them to contribute to polarization. Another is fostering solidarity in the public health effort.We don't see that correlation between political ideologies and people's willingness to get vaccinated or use masks.Mónica Feliú-Mójer"We have to take differentiated strategies to reach different audiences and understand what drives them to get vaccinated or not," she said. "And then I think broad coalitions ... different groups of people and segments of society in Puerto Rico came together to work towards preventing COVID-19, vaccinating people against COVID-19. And I think those broad coalitions are going to be really important to get vaccination levels higher in the United States."Its successes aside, Feliú-Mójer noted that COVID-19 has still killed over 3,200 people in Puerto Rico. And she remains concerned about vaccine equity — particularly in rural communities or among older adults who can't get out of their homes or don't know how to make an appointment. She says the high overall vaccination rate can hide gaps in coverage.Dr. Susana Schwarz inoculates a man at the Puerto Rico Convention Center in San Juan during a mass COVID-19 vaccination event in March.Ricardo Arduengo/AFP via Getty Imageshide captionDr. Susana Schwarz inoculates a man at the Puerto Rico Convention Center in San Juan during a mass COVID-19 vaccination event in March."You have to look beyond that big number," she said in a separate interview with NPR. "But then you look at certain municipalities like Loíza, a town in coastal northern Puerto Rico that's predominantly Black and [a] very poor municipality. Theirvaccination rate is about 55%. And so when you look at some of the social determinants that impact communities like Loíza, then they're not doing as well."According to the Census Bureau, the poverty rate in Puerto Rico stands at 43.5%, while theofficial poverty ratein the U.S. is much lower, at 11.4%. The 2020 census also counted a population just shy of 3.3 million people — more than the populations in 21 states.Those are important figures to consider in weighing Puerto Rico's overall vaccination success, says Colón-Ramos, the adviser to the Puerto Rican government, who is also a professor at the Yale School of Medicine."The experience with vaccines in places like Puerto Rico and the Navajo [N]ation shows that when resources are distributed equitably AND when local scientists and health care leaders are able to direct their own strategies, they can perform better than most US jurisdictions,"Colón-Ramos wrote on Twitter.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

Under the pact, the U.S. drugmakers will allow MPP to license the manufacture of molnupiravir to qualified pharmaceutical companies across the globe."This agreement will help create broad access for molnupiravir use in 105 low- and middle-income countries following appropriate regulatory approvals," Merck and the patent pool said in a news release.MPP Executive Director Charles Gore said in a statement.that the interim results for molnupiravir "are compelling and we see this oral treatment candidate as a potentially important tool to help address the current health crisis."This transparent, public health-driven agreement is MPP's first voluntary license for a COVID-19 medical technology, and we hope that Merck's agreement with MPP will be a strong encouragement to others," Gore added.Under the agreement, Merck and Ridgeback will receive no royalties as long as COVID-19 is considered a global emergency by the World Health Organization. Makers of coronavirus vaccines have yet to make similar agreements, despite pressure from governments and the WHO.Molnupiravir, which is awaiting authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, was originally developed by scientists at Emory University. Itworksby blocking the ability of the coronavirus to replicate.If authorized, the drug would be the first COVID-19 treatment in pill form.

Will StoneBooster shots are now recommended for millions of Americans.Alejandra Villa Loarca/Newsday via Getty Imageshide captionBooster shots are now recommended for millions of Americans.Millions of Americans can now opt for an extra shot of protection against COVID-19, regardless of which vaccine they initially received.The criteria for a booster shot can include your age, job, where you live and your underlying health. In most cases, you have to wait until six months after your first two shots. What's more, a booster shot doesn't have to match the first vaccine you had.As you sort through the maze of information (ideally in coordination with your doctor), remember that even without a booster, the vaccines available in the U.S are very effective."People who have gotten a primary series of immunization — whatever it was — need to understand they have very high levels of protection against death, hospitalization and severe disease," saysDr. Gregory Poland, director of the Mayo Clinic's Vaccine Research Group.Confused?Take our quizto figure out if you need one now.And read on for more about the science — and continuing debate — around boosters.People who are 65 or older, people ages 50 to 64 who have certain underlying health conditions and adults 18 or older who live inlong-term care settingslike nursing homes are all at higher risk of getting COVID-19. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says people in all of these groups who got the Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines originally should get a booster six months after their initial series.For anyone 18 or older who got only one shot of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, the CDC advises that you get a second shot two months after your initial shot — becauseresearch shows that this can substantially bumpup your protection, rivaling the levels seen with two shots of the mRNA vaccines.People who are immunocompromised alsoneed to get an additional shot, because data show they often don't have an effective immune response. This isn't so much a "booster," though. It's just getting them to baseline.Aside from these groups, it's a closer call about who needs to get a shot, saysDr. David Dowdy, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. "For the vast majority of people, there's not an immediate urgency to rush out and get this booster," he says.People who live in certain congregate settings, such as homeless shelters and prisons, and people who work inhigh-risk settings, like health care facilities, schools or grocery stores, may also be at higher risk for COVID-19. This is also true for people 18 to 49 with certain underlying health conditions.But the CDC's guidance is not as strong for these groups. You have the option of getting a booster, but whether you decide to get one will depend on factors such as how much the virus is spreading where you live, whether other safety measures are in place, your underlying health and your own individual sense of risk.If you feel your risk is quite high, then go ahead and get the booster, Dowdy advises. But there's also an argument for holding off. The extra protection from the booster could serve you well at some point in the future when infections are climbing in your community. "I fall into this category myself, and I'm not in a rush to get a booster shot," he says.The protection afforded by the vaccine is waning slightly over time, particularly as the quick-transmitting delta variant circulates, according to studies from the U.S. and other countries, such as Israel. This should not be cause for alarm, though. The most dramatic declines are related to the vaccine's ability to stop asymptomatic or mild breakthrough infections — for instance, a CDCstudy of front-line workersfound that the vaccines' effectiveness at preventing infections dropped from 91% (in pre-delta times) to 66% after the delta variant became dominant.The good news is "we are not seeing a lot of reports of serious disease, hospitalization or death," saysDial Hewlett, an infectious disease physician at the Westchester County Department of Health in Westchester, N.Y.In general, the vaccines are still very protective against hospitalization across all age groups. ACDC study published in late Septembercomparing the real-world effectiveness of all three vaccines at preventing hospitalization found Moderna was 93% effective, Pfizer was 88% and J&J was 71%.But among older adults, the effectiveness appears to be waning slightly. Just how much remains an open debate, and it depends on the vaccine. The Moderna vaccine shows only"mild declines" in vaccine effectivenessagainst hospitalization among people who are 65 or older. It's asimilar picturefor the Pfizer vaccine, although some research shows it may be declining slightly more than Moderna.The Johnson & Johnson vaccine started at a lower effectiveness against hospitalization than either of the mRNA vaccines, butit's not yet clearwhether that protection is waning like the two others'.When you consider the slight dip in vaccine protection, keep the context in mind, saysJonathan Golob, an infectious disease physician at the University of Michigan. "The vaccines still remain excellent even for older adults. The one exception is people who are profoundly immunocompromised," he says.There are different schools of thought on this "mix and match" strategy. Some Americans may find it attractive for a variety of reasons, but so far the data is very limited.The good news is that switching to a different vaccine appears quite safe, says Poland, of the Mayo Clinic. "This is a great social and scientific advance to allow people to do a mix-and-match," he says.Here's why Poland supports switching it up. If you had bad side effects from the first vaccine you got, you can now opt for another. Or sometimes it's just more convenient to get whichever vaccine is first available; you don't have to fret about finding a particular vaccine if supply is limited. And finally, some of the early research shows you may be better protected, depending on the vaccine you used.This last reason may apply especially to those who got the J&J vaccine initially. A study from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) recently found thatfollowing upthe J&J shot with either the Moderna or Pfizer vaccine could produce a stronger immune response than a second dose of J&J's vaccine.Research from Europesupports this conclusion."If it was for me or my family member, I would recommend an mRNA vaccine for those who received J&J," saysDesi Kotis, associate dean at the University of California, San Francisco's School of Pharmacy.If you had Moderna for your first two shots, Poland says, you might consider getting thePfizer booster because it's a smaller dose(30 micrograms) than the Moderna booster (50 micrograms). This could conceivably cut down on side effects, Poland says, while still providing a very strong immune response. He says he plans to do just this for his booster.It's also possible, some experts say, that people who had the Pfizer shots initially will want to chase them with the Moderna booster precisely because the Moderna dose is higher than Pfizer's — with the idea that this might produce a bigger boost in antibodies.Still other experts say it could make sense to keep things simple and stick with the original vaccine you received, especially if that worked well for you initially. All the data on boosters is relatively limited, but "we have a much larger experience in people who have received the same product," says Hewlett.The bottom line, these scientists agree, is that all these ways of boosting your immunity against COVID-19 are safe and effective.According to the NIH study, a booster of Moderna following two shots of that same vaccineleads to the highest antibody levels— more than with Pfizer — although it's probably too small a difference to matter for most groups. Also, the booster dose authorized by the Food and Drug Administration was only half of what was tested in that study.Either way, scientists still don't know how different antibody levels translate into overall immunity, so you can't necessarily assume more is better."Nobody knows what the actual level of protection is longer term for all of these different mix-and-match combinations," says Dowdy.Yes. "There's very, very little risk" of any serious complications from a booster shot, says Kotis, of UCSF. It's reasonable to assume the "booster could show about the same side effects that you had after those first or second series shots."A few specific demographics have an elevated risk of adverse events compared with the general population.Young men between ages 18 and 25are at higher risk of myocarditis and pericarditis (inflammation in parts of the heart) following the mRNA vaccines. Research shows the majority of patients who develop this rare condition report feeling better within six weeks though. For the J&J vaccine, women between ages 18 and 49 account for most cases of a severe blood clot,known as TTS. This, too, remains quite rare. In the U.S., there are under 50 reported cases overall out of the 15 million people who've received the J&J vaccine.Still, it's very reasonable for people who are in these higher-risk demographics to choose a booster based on this concern — i.e., women 18 to 49 could consider choosing one of the mRNA vaccines, and younger men may wish to consider the J&J for their booster.The bottom line is that all three vaccines are safe for the general population, says Poland. When it comes to safety risks from the vaccines, "we can barely quantify the risk — it's so low," he says.Hang tight.If you are under 65 and without any underlying health problems, the vaccines are really holding up well, saysAngela Rasmussen, a virologist at the University of Saskatchewan. "You really don't need a booster — that is what the data indicates."Of course, some people are concerned not only about hospitalization, but also about the chance of getting infected at all. And some studies do show that protection against infection may be dropping for younger adults too.While this is an entirely valid concern, the vaccines were never designed to stop all infections — only the most severe illness. One day, COVID-19 vaccines may be a three-dose series where everyone gets two priming doses and then a booster, "not because everybody's at risk, but because we have a lot of vaccines that are three-dose regimens," says Rasmussen. "It may just be that you do need this third dose to really lock in that long-lasting durability."But we're not quite there yet. In fact, it's good to keep in mind that the research on boosters is far from settled. "The science is not all that strong right now — it's still developing," says Dowdy. "We don't have long-term data on these boosters, if they provide long-term benefits for protection or even how much protection wanes without a booster."NPR's Pien Huang contributed to this report.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

Meanwhile the health commissioner fumed over the praise fellow coworkers heaped on the ousted employee.NASHVILLE, Tenn. — Thefiringof Tennessee's formervaccination directorcaught the state's top health leaders off guard and sent them scrambling for answers as the health commissioner fumed over the praise coworkers heaped on the ousted employee, documents show.Earlier this year, Tennessee's Department of Health sparked national attention after  Dr. Michelle "Shelley" Fiscus was fired under pressure from Republican legislators incensed over the department's efforts to get children vaccinated against COVID-19. Fiscus accused Health Commissioner Lisa Piercey of terminating her "to appease a handful of outraged and uninformed legislators."The Associated Press requested a week's worth of emails among the health department's top leadership regarding Fiscus' firing in mid-July. The records, released for review after several months, paint a more complete picture of an agency in turmoil over the firing of an official who was highly regarded by those fighting to contain the pandemic.The agency last month said it would cost the AP roughly $1,400 to review several hundred records. Ultimately, the department produced some 150 records to view in person at no cost, explaining the discrepancy by saying the initial figure had estimated "potential" costs. The state's open records law requires that all public records be made available for inspection upon request.Emails provided to the AP show some officials were shocked at Fiscus' firing."I am so saddened by this news and honestly cannot comprehend it," wrote Dr. Jill Obremskey, department medical director. "Dr. Fiscus has put forth a herculean effort to assure COVID vaccine was available to anyone who wanted it. Because of her, many lives have been saved."In announcing Fiscus' firing, Dr. John Dunn, state epidemiologist, acknowledged that the news was "sudden, sad and disconcerting to our team members.""I wish her the very best in the future. Her commitment to public health has been very evident during the COVID-19 response effort over the last 18 months," Dunn wrote on July 12.Two days prior, in a separate email to CDC officials, Dunn highlighted that Fiscus had helped lead "herculean efforts" to push the COVID-19 shot among the state's unvaccinated.Dr. Tim Jones, chief medical officer, later told Dunn his kind words about Fiscus had upset Piercey."By the way, the commissioner is really angry that you wrote anything nice about Shelley in your traditional 'farewell message' and that Obremskey reiterated it. It's been fun around here," Jones wrote to Dunn on July 14.A department spokesperson declined to comment on Jones' description, saying it was a personnel issue.The email traffic raises new questions about a letter dated July 9 — attributed to Jones — that recommended the firing of Fiscus.The letter said Fiscus should be removed due to complaints about her leadership approach and her handling of a letter explaining vaccination rights of minors for COVID-19 shots without notifying their parents, which helped prompt the backlash from lawmakers.Tennessee officials, however, didn't release her performance reviews, which are exempted under state public records law. Fiscus' husband Brad circulated them in rebuttal, showing she received glowing appraisals over several years. One positive review came as recently as June, when Dunn praised Fiscus for "strong leadership" while her program was under "very intense scrutiny."A month prior, Republican lawmakers put Fiscus and the department in the hot seat over its childhood vaccine messaging efforts, with one lawmaker floating the possibility of shuttering the health agency as retribution.News of Fiscus' firing quickly resulted in a barrage of phone calls from Tennesseans and others alarmed by her dismissal and the department's decision to pause COVID-19 vaccine outreach efforts for eligible minors. Emails show Republican Gov. Bill Lee's communication team provided a script for the health agency to recite."(The department) began using the script at about 12:45 and it is not going well...the callers are really upset," wrote agency staffer Lisa Hanner.Piercey was on vacation in Greece when Fiscus was fired. Few of the emails provided to AP include her correspondence, but a handful indicate she was monitoring media coverage.At least one doctor emailed Piercey to praise her for firing Fiscus, which the commissioner forwarded to Brandon Gibson, Lee's chief operating officer. There's no indication in the records that she forwarded any emails from the medical community backing Fiscus."I am thankful to my colleagues at the Tennessee Department of Health for coming to my defense and admonishing the department leadership's decision to terminate me from my position," Fiscus told the AP."Tennessee's elected and appointed officials continue to put politics ahead of what is in the best interest of the health and wellbeing of the people of Tennessee and it is the people who will continue to suffer the consequences of these misguided priorities. It's shameful," she added.The department did not respond to the records request until Sept. 9, informing the AP it would cost about $1,400 for attorneys to vet and potentially redact about 875 records. When the AP asked to view the records in person as allowed under Tennessee's open records law, the department updated that the total amount of documents would be 374.Ultimately, the agency only identified 158 documents within the AP's records request. Asked about the reduced number, a department spokesperson said the original estimate included "potential" records, not a firm amount.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

The U.S. plans to send more than a billion vaccines abroad by September 2022.The U.S. has given 200 million COVID-19 vaccine doses to countries in need and has said it will give a total of 1.1 billion by 2022. Yet public health specialists say several more billion doses are needed around the world. Steve Inskeep of NPR's Morning Edition interviewed Gayle Smith, coordinator for global COVID response and health security at the U.S. State Department, to learn more about global vaccine distribution.Gayle Smith, coordinator for global COVID response and health security at the U.S. State Department, speaks at an event in Washington, D.C., in April. She says it is "absolutely urgent" to send surplus vaccines in the U.S. to countries in need.Alexander Drago /POOL/AFP via Getty Imageshide captionGayle Smith, coordinator for global COVID response and health security at the U.S. State Department, speaks at an event in Washington, D.C., in April. She says it is "absolutely urgent" to send surplus vaccines in the U.S. to countries in need.Is the United States doing enough to share doses and encourage other countries to do the same?I think we're doing a great deal. But we are not where we need to be on supply. We need to ramp up the sharing of doses from any country that is able to do so. There have been commitments from the U.K., the European Union. That's terrific.We have worked also on increasing production of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine [in Africa].Tom Frieden, former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, wrote the other day that of 6.5 billion doses globally, only 4% have gone to low-income countries. He blames Pfizer and Moderna for this inequity, because those companies have been selling to the countries that can pay the most. Is he right about that?The global architecture of vaccine production is neither big nor agile enough to provide what's needed in a crisis like this pandemic.I leave it to the drug manufacturers to offer their explanation of why that may be.Some regions have been able to somewhat surmount that obstacle. In the case of the African Union, for example, they mobilized capital from within Africa to purchase 400 million Johnson & Johnson doses, which are now rolling out on the continent. It points to what we're going to need to do in the future: make sure we've got a better system that can reach more people more quickly.If I look atThe New York Timescoronavirus vaccine tracker and run my cursor across Africa, I find that in country after country, a very small percentage of people are vaccinated.The coverage numbers are way too low. That's one of the reasons we've got a primary focus on Africa.Does the U.S. government have the leverage to tell a vaccine maker what to do – say, make more doses — or must you ask them to do things?I think it's more ask than tell, but I think there are ways to ask with enthusiasm.Ask with enthusiasm! I kind of like that.The president came out and did two really critical things. First, he said we are going to start sharing doses in earnest.He also convened a summit of world leaders in September, around the time of the U.N. General Assembly meetings, to tell them to do everything they can [to send doses abroad]. That was a call not only to governments and international organizations but to the private sector, including manufacturers.There's a pretty clear message, not just from the United States but from countries all over the world.I could imagine that someone who lives in a sub-Saharan African country – or in any number of countries around the world struggling with COVID — resenting the United States for getting several hundred million doses of vaccine for itself and only now shipping out its surplus. How would you respond to that person?That's a fair question for someone to ask. The system doesn't seem to work the way it should. But we've also seen there's been tremendous appreciation for the United States in providing doses and making very clear there are no strings attached.What would you say to Americans who ask: Why are we spending money to send hundreds of millions of vaccine doses overseas? It's not our business.It is our business. This is a virus that doesn't know any borders. It doesn't know whether it's in the U.S. or Canada or Nigeria or Singapore. It's just looking for large, unvaccinated populations where it can infect people, replicate, mutate and get stronger and stronger.As long as we've got low rates of vaccination anywhere, [COVID is] a threat to us. It is a huge threat to the global economy, to global stability. So it's absolutely in our interest from a public health perspective.I would also say, as somebody who'sbeen in this work for a long time, it matters that the United States is leading on this – not just from a self-interest point of view, but because of our values. Where you're born shouldn't determine whether or not you can get vaccinated in the midst of a global pandemic.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

But prosecutors say Oudomsine "unjustly enriched himself."Authorities didn't say which Pokemon card Oudomsine allegedly bought with the federal funds, but rare Pokemon cards have been known tofetch tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollarsupon resale.The two defense attorneys representing Oudomsine declined to comment for this story.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Laurel WamsleyLos Angeles International Airport and SoFi Stadium employers spoke with potential job applicants at a job fair in Inglewood, Calif., in September. About 19% of all households in an NPR poll say they lost all their savings during the COVID-19 outbreak, and have none to fall back on.PATRICK T. FALLON/AFP via Getty Imageshide captionLos Angeles International Airport and SoFi Stadium employers spoke with potential job applicants at a job fair in Inglewood, Calif., in September. About 19% of all households in an NPR poll say they lost all their savings during the COVID-19 outbreak, and have none to fall back on.Jonathan Eta had managed to keep his head above water after he lost his job as an auto detailer in Southern California at the start of the pandemic. But last month, the emergency unemployment benefits he relied on expired."Basically, now we're just out on our own, you know?" he says.Eta, who was born in Honduras, lives in the San Fernando Valley, where he's a single father to his three school-aged children. The financial strain he'd staved off for 17 months has arrived. He's now three months behind on rent for the one-bedroom apartment where the four of them live, and he's behind on his credit cards and electric bill, too."Man, it's just hard to find work, constantly worrying about catching the virus. You know, my kids have caught it. My mother, too. So it's really been real, real rocky, you know. I don't know which way to go," Eta says.He's far from the only one feeling that pressure. Thirty-eight percent of households across the U.S. report facing serious financial problems over the last few months. That's according toa poll by NPR, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. And among Black and Latino households, more than 55% reported serious financial problems. That's compared with 29% of white households.Loading...For Eta, the financial strain has made it hard to sleep, and it has stymied his hopes of moving his family to a bigger place."I had some kind of progress going on. Now that's pretty much over with, so I've got to start all over. And it's just been pretty rough, you know, to not have any kind of surety of where we're going or when this is going to be over," he says. The little savings he had are now gone.That lack of savings is a major factor in the unequal financial toll of the pandemic.About 19% of all households say they lost all their savings during the COVID-19 outbreak, and have none to fall back on. Among Black households, the number is higher: 31% reported losing all their savings. And among Latino and Native American families, more than more than a quarter of households report having depleted their savings."The racial wealth gap is real, and one of its most basic manifestations is not having liquid assets," says William Spriggs, professor of economics at Howard University and chief economist to the AFL-CIO.The additional federal aid that expired last month gave people a sense of security, Spriggs says, so they could continue to consume.Loading..."That's all gone away," he says. "So that is, I think, the number one reason you saw special stress in Latino and Black households — because without the boost to the unemployment check, without the stimulus checks still being there, these households simply don't have the savings to endure and be resilient during downturns."Melissa is a single mom in Brooklyn. She's asked we only use her first name because she's ashamed of being unable to provide for her children and doesn't want it widely known how much she is struggling."This has been hell," she says. "I'm trying to survive without a job, without assistance, with two young children. It is incredibly hard."When the pandemic started, she was working as a home health aide. But because she was caring for her kids, checking in on her mother in a nursing home, and looking after her aunts and uncles, she didn't want to work directly with COVID-19 patients."And they didn't want to hear that, so I was forced to take a leave," she says.Around the same time, her wallet was stolen, and with it, the state ID and social security card she needed to apply for various government assistance. Getting replacements for those documents has been slow, with government offices backed up during the pandemic.Loading...When she became eligible for a COVID-19 vaccine earlier this year, Melissa wasn't able to get the protective shot for underlying health reasons. But that's raised her ongoing vulnerability to the coronavirus.Without income, she's leaned on extended family, gone to food pantries and made the most of her supply of canned goods while she looks for a job."I've applied at Target, Kmart, H&M — everything. I've applied everywhere. And you know, it is difficult with my two children because I still have to make sure they go to daycare. And without a voucher ... you're looking at six, seven hundred dollars in daycare a week."She says the pandemic has erased the life she knew before — when she could take care of others in her extended family, instead of just scraping by herself.But there are glimmers of hope: That underlying health issue has at last healed, her doctors now tell her, so she should be able to get vaccinated against the coronavirus, and be able to look for a better-paying job in health care.Until then, she says, her kids are what keep her going. "They wake up every day and look at me like, 'OK, let's go.' They're happy and they help make me happy. They motivate me."And soon, she hopes, the whole family can return to some measure of stability.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

Here, a room is seen in the athletes village in Zhangjiakou, China.Lintao Zhang/Getty Imageshide captionUnvaccinated people who arrive in China for the Beijing Olympcs will face isolation in a mandatory three-week quarantine. Here, a room is seen in the athletes village in Zhangjiakou, China.Olympic athletes, team staff and journalists who arrive at the Beijing 2022 Winter Games next February will be required to be vaccinated — or face a three-week "hard quarantine" period that lasts longer than the Games themselves. That's according to new guidelines from the International Olympic Committee.A hard quarantine requires a participant to remain in a tightly controlled area, such as a hotel room. To avoid that requirement, anyone visiting China for the Olympics will need to be vaccinated at least 14 days before arrival."With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, absolutely no one involved in the Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games Beijing 2022 can afford to be complacent," said Colleen Wrenn, the International Paralympic Committee's  chief Paralympic Games delivery officer.Daily PCR tests will also be required, according to the Olympics' newCOVID-19 "playbooks"that were released Monday. The requirements were created by the International Olympic Committee, Beijing organizers and China's government."If you have been to the Games before, I know this experience will be different in a number of ways," said Juan Antonio Samaranch, who chairs the coordinating commission for the Beijing 2022 Olympics. But he added that the restrictions are the only way to safely hold the Games during a pandemic.The policies are stricter than those used inthis summer's Tokyo Olympics, where athletes were required to be tested multiple times as they traveled to Japan — but were then required to quarantine for three days. Athletes also underwent daily testing in Tokyo.It's too soon to know what impact the policy might have on Team USA, particularly because many event rosters are not yet finalized. But the U.S.lagged behindmany other large delegations at the Tokyo Olympics.Roughly 100out of the more than 610 U.S. Olympians who went to Japan did so without being vaccinated.In Beijing, the vaccine requirement can be waived "on a case-by-case basis, based on medical reasons," organizers said. The policy does not mention religious beliefs or other conditions that frequently allow for exceptions to vaccine rules in the U.S.Athletes, the media and others who are visiting China for the Winter Games will also be restricted to a "closed loop," where they'll be kept as separate as possible from the local population. They're "only allowed to travel in dedicated vehicles between permitted destinations," the playbooks state."This is to ensure that all COVID-19 countermeasures are strictly followed and there is no contact with the general public or anyone outside of the closed loop," the playbook says. Many of those conditions are similar to Japanese organizers' approach to the Tokyo Olympics, which were postponed by a year due to the pandemic.The Winter Olympics' opening ceremony will take place on Feb. 4; the Games conclude on Feb. 20. The Paralympic Winter Games will be held from March 4 to 13.The newly released playbooks — one for athletes and teams, another for the media — are the first edition of the COVID-19 rules for the Beijing Olympics; an update is expected to come later this year."In developing the Playbooks, we made it a top priority to safeguard the safety and health of all Games participants including athletes, as well as the Chinese people," said Han Zirong, secretary-general of the Beijing 2022 organizing committee.Unlike most events at the Tokyo Summer Olympics, spectators will be allowed to attend events at the Beijing Winter Olympics in person — but only ifthey're from mainland China.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
The Associated PressFDA scientists concluded that in almost every scenario the Pfizer vaccine's benefit for preventing hospitalizations and death from COVID-19 would outweigh any serious potential side effects in children.Pfizer via APhide captionFDA scientists concluded that in almost every scenario the Pfizer vaccine's benefit for preventing hospitalizations and death from COVID-19 would outweigh any serious potential side effects in children.Federal health regulators said late Friday that kid-size doses of Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine appear highly effective at preventing symptomatic infections in elementary school children and caused no unexpected safety issues, as the U.S. weighs beginning vaccinations in youngsters.The Food and Drug Administration posted its analysis ofPfizer's dataahead of a public meeting next week to debate whether the shots are ready for the nation's roughly 28 million children ages 5 to 11. The agency will ask a panel of outside vaccine experts to vote on that question.In their analysis, FDA scientists concluded that in almost every scenario the vaccine's benefit for preventing hospitalizations and death from COVID-19 would outweigh any serious potential side effects in children. But agency reviewers stopped short of calling for Pfizer's shot to be authorized.The agency will put that question to its panel of independent advisers next Tuesday and weigh their advice before making its own decision.If the FDA authorizes the shots, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will make additional recommendations on who should receive them the first week of November. Children could begin vaccinations early next month — with the first youngsters in line fully protected by Christmas.Full-strength Pfizer shots already are recommended for anyone 12 or older, but pediatricians and many parents are anxiously awaiting protection for younger children to stem infections from the extra-contagious delta variant and help keep kids in school.The FDA review affirmedresults from Pfizerposted earlier in the day showing the two-dose shot was nearly 91% effective at preventing symptomatic infection in young children. Researchers calculated the figure based on 16 COVID-19 cases in youngsters given dummy shots versus three cases among vaccinated children. There were no severe illnesses reported among any of the youngsters, but the vaccinated ones had much milder symptoms than their unvaccinated counterparts.Most of the study data was collected in the U.S. during August and September, when the delta variant had become the dominant COVID-19 strain.The FDA review found no new or unexpected side effects. Those that did occur mostly consisted of sore arms, fever or achiness.However, FDA scientists noted that the study wasn't large enough to detect extremely rare side effects, including myocarditis, a type of heart inflammation that occasionally occurs after the second dose.The agency used statistical modeling to try to predict how many hospitalizations and deaths from COVID-19 the vaccine would prevent versus the number of potential heart side effects it might cause. In four scenarios of the pandemic, the vaccine clearly prevented more hospitalizations than would be expected from the heart side effect. Only when virus cases were extremely low could the vaccine cause more hospitalizations than it would prevent. But overall, regulators concluded that the vaccine's protective benefits "would clearly outweigh" its risks.While children run a lower risk of severe illness or death than older people, COVID-19 has killed more than 630 Americans 18 and under, according to the CDC. Nearly 6.2 million children have been infected with the coronavirus, more than 1.1 million in the last six weeks as the delta variant surged, the American Academy of Pediatrics says.The Biden administrationhas purchased enough kid-size doses— in special orange-capped vials to distinguish them from adult vaccine — for the nation's 5- to 11-year-olds. If the vaccine is cleared, millions of doses will be promptly shipped around the country, along with kid-size needles.More than 25,000 pediatricians and primary care providers already have signed up to get the shots into little arms.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

She'd been hospitalized this summer with COVID-19 and on a ventilator.She did not get the vaccine fearing it might hurt the baby. Doctors now want pregnant women to know it is safe.In September, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention urged expecting mothers to get vaccinated warning complications from COVID can be deadly for both mother and baby. Still, two-thirds of pregnant women have not.The Grices and another South Carolina family are sharing their stories of pregnancies unvaccinated in hopes of changing minds.Kimberly was rushed to a crowded emergency room in late July where a six hour wait revealed she had COVID pneumonia. Her husband Tory shares the rest of the journey she can't remember including the question doctor repeatedly asked in case of complications. Whose life should they save first if something goes wrong, Kimberly's or the baby's?"What you want to say is like, both of them. But that can't be the answer," says Tory.Kimberly's liver appeared to be failing when doctors considered an emergency C-section after taking her off a ventilator. But then her health improved, and they decided not to deliver the baby nine weeks early.When Kimberly came to, it was nearly September and she was confused. How did she wind up in a Charleston hospital and who were the doctors and nurses now in her room?"They're like, I just need to see you. They're like, you were sick.  You're a miracle," says Kimberly.Her body was worn out. But on Oct. 22, Kimberly gave birth to Leilani Grice, a healthy baby girl weighing 7 lbs. 2 ounces.Kimberly and Tory Grice's daughter Leilani was born healthy after her mother was hospitalized for COVID.Victoria Hansen/South Carolina Public Radiohide captionKimberly and Tory Grice's daughter Leilani was born healthy after her mother was hospitalized for COVID."The risk of putting your life at risk, your unborn child's life at risk, is not worth it," says Dr. Rebecca Wineland.  She is the director of labor and delivery at the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston.Wineland says expecting mothers infected with the fast spreading Delta variant are at a greater risk for stillbirths, babies with restricted growth and pre-eclampsia, a leading cause of maternal and infant death worldwide.She is also seeing first-hand what the CDC warns, expecting mothers who get COVID are twice as likely to be admitted to the ICU and have a 70% increased risk of losing their lives."It will absolutely save your life and decrease your risk of hospitalization if you were to get COVID," Wineland says.But the message came too late for Scott Baisley and his two-month-old son Sullivan who live just outside Charleston.Scott cradles the crying infant trying to comfort him. An empty bottle sits next to a framed ultrasound picture and wedding photo displayed on a table beside them.Scott's wife Clair was 33 years old when she collapsed on the floor of their home in August, within days of being diagnosed with COVID. She was quickly hospitalized with double pneumonia.A week later, doctors decided they had to deliver Sullivan by C-section. Clair was put on a ventilator and given a 10% chance to live. Less than a month after her diagnosis, doctors were desperately trying to save her."But that was it. I watched her numbers drop. I watched her blood oxygen continue to go down. I watched her heart rate increase," Scott says.Suddenly Clair was gone. COVID had taken her life. She never got to hold Sullivan."Having a son without a mother is one of the most painful things I've ever had to experience."It's a pain Scott doesn't want anyone else to have to endure.A previous web introduction on this story incorrectly said only two-thirds of pregnant Americans are vaccinated for COVID-19.

The lower dose was chosen to minimize side effects and because it still prompts a strong immune response, the companies said.In the main clinical trial conducted by the companies, the vaccine appeared to be more than 90% effective against symptomatic COVID-19No new safety problems were identified in the companies' studies. No cases of heart inflammation were observed in the main study, but only a few thousand children were included in the research, so that sort of rare problem wouldn't necessarily be detected.The antibody response to the vaccine was comparable to the one seen in people 16 to 25 years old.The FDA is preparing its own analysis, which is likely to be released later Friday.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

The former tenants had lived there for months without paying rent.Jessica Ruiz for NPRhide captionNitin Bajaj and Nimisha Lotia stand with their kids inside the empty and damaged apartment unit earlier this month in Los Angeles. The former tenants had lived there for months without paying rent.Just before the pandemic, Nitin Bajaj and his wife, Nimisha Lotia, rented an apartment they own in Los Angeles to two young women."They were really nice to talk to," Lotia says.But as soon as the pandemic hit, the new renters, both in their late 20s, stopped paying the rent. Lotia says the young women sent them an email saying that COVID-19 had created a financial hardship and that the city had just imposed an eviction ban — so the renters couldn't be evicted."No further explanation," she says. "No calls or nothing, just an email, and I think a snapshot of what the city rule was."Across the country, more than 20 million Americans lost their jobs as the pandemic took hold. Many fell behind on rent. Eviction moratoriums at the local, state and federal level clearly helped millions of people keep a roof over their heads as they struggled financially. But some other renters took advantage of the protections.Lotia says she's not sure whether the renters lost their jobs or not. But things started to get weird after they stopped paying the rent. The young women stopped talking to them on their way in and out of the house."They didn't make eye contact," Bajaj says. So that went on for a few weeks."Then I lost my job due to COVID," Lotia says. "And that was a major hit as well because there were two streams of income that had just stopped coming in."Nitin Bajaj and his wife Nimisha purchased this small apartment building almost 10 years ago. The family has gradually fixed it up, removing bars from the window and painting it. Early on, Bajaj had to drag a dismantled abandoned van out of the yard. "There was a bumper here, and a door there," he says.Jessica Ruiz for NPRhide captionBajaj and Lotia aren't big corporate landlords with massive real estate holdings. They're immigrants from Mumbai, India, who bought a small rundown building with four units nearly 10 years ago. They were starting a family and couldn't afford a traditional single-family house. So they live in one apartment and rent out the others.Over the years, they've slowly turned it into a nice home. They painted it, replaced all 42 of the windows and removed the security bars.The rental income helps keep the family afloat. Bajaj works for an education nonprofit, and after Lotia lost her job, living on his salary was tough. So the couple rented out their own home, the apartment where they live, and moved 80 miles away to a much cheaper house out in the desert.Lyra Bajaj, 11, and Reva Bajaj, 9, play near a cabin their parents built for them after clearing out and fixing up their apartment building in Los Angeles.Jessica Ruiz for NPRhide captionLotia says their kids couldn't even go outside it was so hot. "They were very angry with us," she says. "They're just 9 and 11 so leaving their friends, their life just completely changed like upside down within a couple of weeks." Months went by and the renters still weren't paying any rent.Meanwhile, pressure was building from housing advocates and landlord groups for Congress to do something to prevent a wave of evictions. And last December, lawmakers passed an emergency rental assistance program. In all, it would be $47 billion to prevent evictions and pay back rent. And that would help both renters and landlords."It was great to hear," says Bajaj. "I started looking for information."Nitin Bajaj surveys the damaged empty kitchen earlier this month. The stove the tenants took with them has been replaced, but there is still much work to be done.Jessica Ruiz for NPRhide captionNitin Bajaj surveys the damaged empty kitchen earlier this month. The stove the tenants took with them has been replaced, but there is still much work to be done.But distributing rental assistance money turned out to be a slow process. And the tenants had lots of complaints, even though they weren't paying rent. They called the city if they thought the plants near a walkway needed to be cut. They even called a city inspector because they didn't like how the new dishwasher was working."I was just appalled and I was like, seriously?" Lotia remembers. "I'm already going through so much and that was adding to it. There was so much more stress."Eventually, this past spring, the rental assistance program in Los Angeles started taking applications. Bajaj says he was told that the renters needed to supply some documents."So we reached out to the tenants and said, 'Hey, could you guys please do that?' " He says they tried emailing, calling, approaching them in person, but, "they would just not talk."Nimisha Lotia recalls how the problem tenants apparently had no money for rent but no problem with making constant complaints.Jessica Ruiz for NPRhide captionFinally, in July, the renters left unexpectedly in the middle of the night.They must have had a pretty big truck because when they moved out, the couple says, they stole some rather large objects. Nimisha remembers walking through the apartment the morning after they left."When I reached the kitchen, I noticed, why does this look so open?" Lotia says. "Like, why is it looking so empty and bright? And then I realized, oh, the fridge is missing! Then, oh, my god, the other appliances are missing!"The couple says the renters stole the refrigerator and the gas stove. They even took the dishwasher they had complained to the city about.The damage left by the tenants went from floor to ceiling, leaving Bajaj and Lotia with a long to-do list before they can rent out the unit again.Jessica Ruiz for NPRhide captionThere was also considerable damage to the apartment including cigarette burns on the vinyl floors. The tenants hadn't paid rent in 16 months, which added up to $32,000 in lost rent. NPR reached out to the tenants; they did not respond to requests for comment.So, the couple has been calling the city rental assistance program to try to get reimbursed. After all, Congress has approved $47 billion for rental assistance.The couple says the renters stole the refrigerator, the gas stove and even the dishwasher they had complained to the city about.Nitin Bajajhide caption"We spoke to 17 different agents, two supervisors, it was very frustrating to not get any kind of answer," Bajaj says.Eventually they were told they couldn't qualify for any help, because for landlords to get paid, renters need to cooperate with the program.Across the country, other landlords are discovering the same thing. The same rule applies at all 500 state and local programs distributing that money from Congress.There are a couple of different reasons for that. Fraud prevention is one.Also, policymakers don't want landlords to be able to just evict lots of people and then collect the back rent. Preventing evictions is a primary goal.Noel Andrés Poyo is a deputy U.S. Treasury secretary who oversees emergency rental assistance efforts nationally. He says it's difficult to allow landlords to get help without the cooperation of renters and stay within the rules of the law passed by Congress.Nitin Bajaj, with his youngest daughter Reva Bajaj, 9, in the background, has found that the federal rental assistance program has been unable to assist them.Jessica Ruiz for NPRhide captionBut he says, that may change. "Right now, Congress is engaged in a process of looking at the original legislation and whether some updates can or should be made," Poyo says.So, Congress or Treasury might soon come up with a workaround for landlords like Bajaj and Lotia. The couple says that because the government imposed eviction bans for so long, it's only fair that landlords in a situation like theirs be able to get some of this money from Congress."You just cannot be black and white," Lotia says, "like we're just not going to help the landlords at all."Meanwhile, the couple is hoping one way or another they can recoup the $32,000 in back rent, which would help them buy a new refrigerator for their rental unit.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Anya KamenetzKaren Watkins is vice chair of the school board of Gwinnett County, a suburban county north of Atlanta. She is surprised that she has become a target for a political culture war. "I just didn't realize that it would impact the local school board," Watkins says. "Our main focus is towards student achievement and ensuring that we are producing children that are thriving."Johnathon Kelso for NPRhide captionKaren Watkins is vice chair of the school board of Gwinnett County, a suburban county north of Atlanta. She is surprised that she has become a target for a political culture war. "I just didn't realize that it would impact the local school board," Watkins says. "Our main focus is towards student achievement and ensuring that we are producing children that are thriving."Karen Watkins works in supply chain management and has two children in public school in Gwinnett County, Ga. She's one of those moms who has always been very involved in her kids' education. So much so that local officials urged her to run for school board last year."They said, 'This is probably going to be a good thing for you and you can probably make a difference.' ... But I didn't realize it came with a package, a big package," she says with a rueful laugh.She wasn't prepared for the blowback that set in as soon as she put up her Facebook page to announce her campaign. She was inundated with messages like:"You have sold your soul to satan .. you are greedy and deceitful ..you have no part with the truth!"And: "Karen here some news for you the DEMOCRATIC COMMUNIST BABY KILLER PARTY doesn't have any values !!!""I knew we were in a heightened political era where there's a lot of divisive issues," Watkins says. "I just didn't realize that it would impact the local school board... Our main focus is towards student achievement and ensuring that we are producing children that are thriving."All over the country, local school board members, who are typically volunteers or serve for small stipends, have indeed been placed on the front line of a national culture war. Protestors are mobilizing against masks, vaccines, LGBTQ rights, removing police from schools, and diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. In early October, U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garlanddirected the FBIto meet with state and local authorities to create "strategies for addressing threats against school administrators, board members, teachers, and staff."NPR spoke to school board members in California, Ohio, Michigan and Pennsylvania, in addition to Watkins and a fellow board member in Georgia. All of them told similar stories: of being yelled at in meetings that are sometimes brought to a halt entirely; receiving threatening letters; being followed to their cars; and being photographed or filmed.Watkins says it's hard to know just where all the vitriol is coming from. But her picture does appear alongside two of her fellow challenger candidates, all women of color, inan opposition video adthat ran online in October 2020."Here in Gwinnett County our kids face a grave threat. A ticket of radical liberals is running for school board," says the voiceover.The ad connects Watkins and two other school board candidates to teen pregnancy, Marxism and the 2018 school shooting in Parkland, Fla. — that last because of the candidates' support for reducing the use of police officers in schools.The ad is credited to Family Policy Alliance, a right-wing Christian lobbying group with chapters around the country. The Georgia chapter is now an independent group known as Frontline Policy Action, and it's led by Cole Muzio."Our focus is to glorify God in the public square," Muzio says. "We focus on the right to life, religious freedom and God's design." They created the ad because, he says, "we saw a tremendous need to step in and protect the kids in Gwinnett County."Gwinnett County, a northeast suburb of Atlanta, is the 13th largest public school district in the country and its schools have a solid reputation. The county has changed rapidly over the past two decades, becoming far more diverse. When Watkins, who is Black and Filipina, and Tarece Johnson, who is Black and Jewish, were elected to the Gwinnett County Board of Education last November, they flipped the board to be majority-Democrat and majority-people of color."I think we have a healthy board now with all of our diversity. White, Black, Asian, LGBTQ. I think that's a healthy representation of what our school system looks like," Watkins says.But she feels like she's being targeted now precisely because of her race, ethnicity and gender. And she worries about how those threats could impact her family and community. "I don't want our kids to get hurt or other people to get hurt because of me, because of a thought of me," she says through tears. "I didn't sign up for that."The May 20, 2021, school board meeting was a turning point for Watkins. It was graduation season; students were there with their families, dressed up, being honored for their achievements.From the dais, Watkins and her colleagues faced down an overwhelmingly white, unmasked crowd of dozens. Avideo of the meetingshows protestors in T-shirts that said "UNMASK OUR CHILDREN" and "We The People Take Back Our Schools".Watkins says she ran for school board because she has two children in the public schools. Now she's worried that her family may be targeted.Johnathon Kelso for NPRhide captionWatkins says she ran for school board because she has two children in the public schools. Now she's worried that her family may be targeted."People were saying, 'Stand your ground,' and, 'They can't remove all of us.' Stand your ground — that's enough for me," Watkins says. "When you're saying things like that, it triggers things in my brain."Johnson says she recognized some of the protesters from Web sites and social media pages that had been targeting her. "So May 20th happens, I'm seeing these people, I'm hearing my name in the hallway, I'm hearing somebody talk about children or her children or something, and then the shouting and screaming and I — I'm just looking at these people like, I don't understand."Watkins and Johnson say they felt so personally threatened that they left the room and watched the public comments on the live stream.There were nearly 60 people signed up to speak that night. Many sounded really angry, like a muscular man in a black T-shirt and cap who gave his name as Steve Smith. He called Watkins and Johnson "cowards" for leaving the room. He was protesting the idea of diversity, equity and inclusion: "And anyone who supports this poisonous ideological cult, we the parents of Gwinnett County are coming for you."That's not the first time Watkins had heard this kind of language. She says one of her constituents had said something similar over the phone, after calling her to discuss the district's masking policy. "'We are coming for you' — how am I supposed to take that?"And it's not just words. Watkins has been followed to the parking lot after a board meeting by someone who appeared to be videotaping her license plate. Strange cars have been parked near her house, and driven away when her neighbors walked up to ask questions. Once, Watkins says, she was out jogging when a man pulled up at a stop sign and asked, "Is your husband home?" Watkins was terrified."I was doing a nice leisurely jog and I booked it home after that," she recalls.Her fellow new board member, Tarece Johnson, has been targeted online for old TikToks featuring her work as an artist, poet and Black Lives Matter activist. She says she has felt so intimidated that she purchased a gun for protection.Frontline Policy Action, meanwhile, posted on its Facebook page on Oct. 11, criticizing the U.S. attorney general's action on school board disruptions. "Parents are not domestic terrorists because they want to remove radical indoctrination from their children's classrooms," the post said. One of the commenters responded, "We should be surrounding DC."Muzio says he tries to delete those kinds of comments when they show up, and they don't represent his group. "We shouldn't be surrounding D.C. Now is not the time to marshal forces ...There's no way that we encourage attacks on school board members. I think there's a rhetoric and tone that sometimes should be dialed down. But what these kids are facing in schools is a direct attack on what parents have worked to instill in them. And we have a real crisis, I think, going on in schools."Protestors are aiming harassment, insults, and threats not just at board members of color in diverse counties like Gwinnett, but at school district leaders of all races in small and medium-sized districts all over the country. One theme is the interruption of public meetings to the point where public business can't take place. In conversations with NPR, several school board members referred to these as "mini-insurrections" or "mini January 6ths." In places with indoor mask mandates, unmasked protestors present a safety threat before they say or do anything.Nikki Hudson, who is white, is on the school board in Worthington, Ohio, a suburb of Columbus. She says anti-mask protestorsgiving the Nazi salutehave brought her meetings to a halt. In September, she received a letter that read, in part: "You have become our enemies and you will be removed one way or another." Hudson says the letter was also sent to at least four surrounding school districts with language implying that she, Hudson, would be made an example of. Hudson thinks she's being particularly targeted because of her vote to remove police officers from high schools last year. Shewent publicwith the letter, and she's running for reelection."I have a 12-year-old and a 14-year-old," she says. "I feel very passionately about modeling behavior. And you don't back down to bullies, and you do what's right even when it's hard."Marc Bertrando is the superintendent for Garnet Valley School District in suburban Philadelphia."Our August [school board] meeting was, without a close second, the worst in my experience as an administrator that spans almost 20 years now," he says.He says protesters came in without masks andrefused to leaveuntil state police were called in.And then there were the insults."It never feels good to be called a coward or a Marxist or have people tell you that you're a terrible leader or that you should be fired," Bertrando says.Sara Clark Pierson is president of the Grand Ledge Board of Education, another medium-sized suburban district, this one outside of Lansing, Mich. Pierson has been in public service for 30 years, and has deep roots in the community. She too says she's never seen anything like this."We used to see people who would shout, and occasionally follow me to my car ... Now what we're seeing are people who rush at the stage with their fists in the air shouting at us. Yelling at me, as board president, saying, 'Take her seat, we'll run this meeting.' "Pierson says it's angry, aggressive and very personal."I had a 40-year marriage that ended and it was deeply painful for me. And one woman got up [at a meeting] and said, 'You are a disappointment to this community ... no one in the community likes you. You're an embarrassment. In fact, even your family doesn't like you, and that's why they left you.' "Pierson says she took comfort in the words of a local minister who reached out after some of these confrontations were aired on the news."I said, 'Where do you think this is coming from?' And she said, 'You know, there's a lot of grief in the community. There's a lot of loss. And ... people have a hard time expressing grief, but they can express anger.' "On a good day, Pierson says she tries to have understanding for the people who are getting up and yelling at her. She has no intention of leaving her post.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

Bernie Sanders in Culver City, Calif., on Jan. 24. Standing out in a crowd of glamorously dressed guests, Sanders showed up for the presidential inauguration in a heavy winter jacket and patterned mittens — with an AFP photo of the veteran leftist spawning the first viral meme of the Biden era.Does amemea day keep the doctor away? Not quite, but it looks like it might help, according to one recent study.Researchers with Pennsylvania State University and the University of California Santa Barbara found that memes helped people cope with life during the COVID-19 pandemic, according to astudypublished this week in thePsychology of Popular Mediajournal. Researchers found that those who viewed memes — a type of humor they described as funny or cute pictures that reference pop culture — reported "higher levels of humor" and more positive feelings, according to anews releasefrom the American Psychological Association, which publishes the journal.They surveyed 748 people online last December: 72% of those who responded were white, 54% identified as women, 63% didn't hold a college degree, and their ages ranged from 18 to 88, the release states. They were shown a variety of meme types, with different kinds of photos and captions, and asked to rate the cuteness, humor and emotional responses prompted by the materials, as well as how much the memes in question made them think about COVID-19.Those who viewed memes that specifically referenced the pandemic felt less stress than those who viewed non-pandemic-related memes. They also felt more capable of coping with the COVID-19 crisis and were better at processing information, according to the study. And they were also less likely to be stressed about the pandemic than those who didn't view memes related to COVID-19 at all, researchers concluded.The type of meme matters, too: People who viewed memes featuring cute babies or baby animals were overall less likely to think about the pandemic or the effects it has had on them, regardless of the type of caption, according to this week's release. (And researchers also found that those who were surveyed found that memes with animals in them were cuter than those featuring humans, the APA said.)The results of the study show that memes about stressful situations can potentially help the public deal with and process those situations, researchers said."While the World Health Organization recommended that people avoid too much COVID-related media for the benefit of their mental health, our research reveals that memes about COVID-19 could help people feel more confident in their ability to deal with the pandemic," Jessica Gall Myrick, a lead author of the study and a professor at Pennsylvania State University, said in the APA release. "This suggests that not all media are uniformly bad for mental health and people should stop and take stock of what type of media they are consuming. If we are all more conscious of how our behaviors, including time spent scrolling, affect our emotional states, then we will better be able to use social media to help us when we need it and to take a break from it when we need that instead."So the next time you worry that you're wasting time scrolling through memes, just think: It could be good for your health.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Patty WightFromIn between answering 911 calls, Jerrad Dinsmore (left) and Kevin LeCaptain perform a wellness check at the home of a woman in her nineties. The ambulance team in the small town of Waldoboro, Maine was already short-staffed. Then a team member quit recently, after the state mandated all health care workers get the COVID-19 vaccine.Patty Wight/Maine Public Radiohide captionIn between answering 911 calls, Jerrad Dinsmore (left) and Kevin LeCaptain perform a wellness check at the home of a woman in her nineties. The ambulance team in the small town of Waldoboro, Maine was already short-staffed. Then a team member quit recently, after the state mandated all health care workers get the COVID-19 vaccine.On a recent morning, Jerrad Dinsmore and Kevin LeCaptain of Waldoboro EMS drove their ambulance to a secluded house near the ocean, to measure the clotting levels of a woman in her nineties.They told the woman, bundled under blankets to keep warm, that they'll contact her doctor with the result."Is there anything else we can do?" Dinsmore asked."No," she said, "I'm all set."This wellness check, which took about 10 minutes, is one of the duties Dinsmore and LeCaptain perform in addition to the emergency calls they respond to as staffers with Waldoboro's Emergency Medical Services (EMS). The EMS crews have been busier than ever this year, as people who delayed getting care during the pandemic grew progressively sicker.This story was produced in partnership withKaiser Health News.But there's limited workforce to meet the demand.  Dinsmore and LeCaptain spend more than 20 hours a week working for Waldoboro, on top of their full-time EMS jobs in other towns.  It's common in Maine for EMS staffers to work for multiple departments, because most EMS crews need the help — and Waldoboro may soon need even more of it.The department has already lost one EMS worker who quit because of Maine's Covid-19 vaccine mandate for healthcare workers, and may lose another two.The stress of filling those vacancies keeps Town Manager Julie Keizer awake at night."So we're a 24-hour service," Keizer explains. "If I lose three people who were putting in 40 hours or over, that's 120 hours I can't cover. In Lincoln County, we already have a stressed system."The labor shortage almost forced Waldoboro to shut down ambulance service for a recent weekend.  Keizer says she supports vaccination, but believes Maine's decision to mandate them threatens the ability for some EMS departments to function.Maine is one of 10statesthat require health care workers to get vaccinated against Covid-19 or risk losing their jobs. Along with Oregon, Washington state, and Washington, D.C., it also explicitly includes the EMTs and paramedics who respond to 911 calls in that mandate. Some ambulance crews say it's making an ongoing staffing crisis even worse.Two hundred miles north of Waldoboro, near the border with Canada, is Fort Fairfield, a small town of 3,200.  Deputy Fire Chief Cody Fenderson explains that two workers got vaccinated after the mandate was issued in mid-August, but eight quit."That was extremely frustrating," Fenderson says.Now Fort Fairfield only has five full-time staffers available to fill 10 slots. Their roster of per diem workers all have full time jobs elsewhere, many with other EMS departments that are also facing shortages."You know, anybody who does ambulances is suffering," says Fenderson.  "It's tough.  I'm not sure what we're going to do and I don't know what the answer is."Bothnationallyand in Maine, staffing issues have plagued the EMS system for years.  It's intense work that takes a lot of training and offers low pay.  In Maine's largest city, Portland, the municipal first-responder workforce is around 200 people, and 8 are expected to quit because of the vaccine mandate, according to the union president for firefighters, Chris Thomson.That may not seem like a significant loss, but Thomson explains those are full-time positions, and those vacancies will have to be covered by other employees who are already exhausted by the pandemic and working overtime."You know, the union encourages people to get their vaccine.  I personally got the vaccine.  And we're not in denial of how serious the pandemic is," Thomson says. "But the firefighters and the nurses have been doing this for a year and half, and I think that we've done it safely.  And I think the only thing that really threatens the health of the public is short staffing."Thomson maintains unvaccinated staff should be allowed to stay on the job because they're experts in infection-control measures and wear personal protective equipment such as masks and gloves.Waldoboro's EMS director, Richard Lash, is working 120 hours a week to help cover the vacancies. He's 65 and has plans to retire next year.Patty Wight/Maine Public Radiohide captionWaldoboro's EMS director, Richard Lash, is working 120 hours a week to help cover the vacancies. He's 65 and has plans to retire next year.But Maine's Public Safety Commissioner, Mike Sauschuck, says EMS departments also risk staff shortages if workers are exposed to COVID and have to isolate or quarantine."Win-win scenarios are often talked about but seldom realized," he says.  "So sure, you may have a situation where staffing concerns are a reality in communities.  But for us, we do believe the broader impact, the safer impact on our system is through vaccination."Some EMS departments in Maine have complied fully with the mandate, with no one quitting. Andrew Turcotte, the Fire Chief and Director of EMS for the city of Westbrook, says all 70 of his staff members are now vaccinated.  He doesn't see the new mandate as being any different from the vaccine requirements to attend school or to enter the healthcare field."I think that we all have not only a social responsibility but a moral one," Turcotte says.  "We chose to get into the healthcare field, and with that comes responsibilities and accountabilities.  That includes ensuring that you're vaccinated."Statewide numbers released Wednesday show close to 97% of EMS workers in Maine have gotten vaccinated.  But that varies by county: rural Piscataquis and Franklin counties reported that 18% and 10% of EMS employees, respectively, are still unvaccinated as of mid-October.Not all EMS departments have reported their vaccination rates to the state.  Waldoboro is in Lincoln County, where only 8 of the 12 departments have reported their rates.  Among those 8, the rate of noncompliance was just 1.6%.But in small departments like Waldoboro, the loss of even one staff member can create a huge logistical problem.  Over the past few months, Waldoboro's EMS director, Richard Lash, started working 120 hours a week to help cover the vacancies. He's 65 and is planning to retire next year."I've told my town manager that we'll do the best we can do. But, you know, I can't continue to work 120 hours a week to fill shifts," says Lash.  "I'm getting old. And I just can't keep doing that."This story was produced as part of NPR's health reporting partnership withMaine Public Radioand Kaiser Health News (KHN).Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Selena Simmons-DuffinErica Cuellar, her husband and her daughter moved in with her father in his home early in the pandemic, after she lost her job. She and her husband were worried they wouldn't be able to afford the rent on their house in Houston with only one income. In July 2020, the whole family tested positive for the coronavirus.Michael Starghill for NPRhide captionErica Cuellar, her husband and her daughter moved in with her father in his home early in the pandemic, after she lost her job. She and her husband were worried they wouldn't be able to afford the rent on their house in Houston with only one income. In July 2020, the whole family tested positive for the coronavirus.Erica Cuellar's dad wasn't worried, even if she was.It was still the early days of the coronavirus pandemic — March 2020 — and Cuellar and her husband were becoming anxious about whether they could afford the $1,200 rent for their house in Houston. She'd lost her job as a home health aide for a boy with autism, and the news made it sound like most businesses were about to shut down, which would likely mean her husband would be getting fewer hours at the pipe yard where he works — or maybe even be laid off."If there was going to be shutdowns, those shutdowns would be not paid," she says. And, of course, "working with pipes is not really something you can do at home."Her dad, on the other hand, lives in town, and owns his home. So he invited the couple and their toddler to move in with him — even though he was in his mid-60s and having a houseful of people could put him more at risk of getting COVID-19.This story of families moving in together when their rent became unaffordable illustrates just one way that housing insecurity has connected to viral transmission during the pandemic."A person loses their home; they often move in with friends or family, [or] they might enter a homeless shelter," saysKathryn Leifheit, a postdoctoral fellow and epidemiologist at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health. They might move into a motel, so everyone's in closer quarters. Losing a home "increases your number of contacts in the community, and it increases the efficiency with which COVID can spread through a community.""My dad was like, 'Don't worry about it. We'll be fine,' " Cuellar says. "My dad — he doesn't like going to the hospital or anything. He believes he can cure himself. He was like, 'Don't worry. I'll be fine.' "The young family broke their lease early and moved in with him. Cuellar's husband had fewer hours, but he was still going in to work at the pipe yard, so there was a risk he could bring the virus home. "His job did not take [the pandemic] seriously, whatsoever," Cuellar says.Then, in July 2020, her husband got sick.Neither Cuellar nor her daughter developed symptoms from their coronavirus infections, but her husband and father both ended up in the hospital with COVID-19. Both men are still experiencing lingering health effects, she says.Michael Starghill for NPRhide captionNeither Cuellar nor her daughter developed symptoms from their coronavirus infections, but her husband and father both ended up in the hospital with COVID-19. Both men are still experiencing lingering health effects, she says."July the 4th — that's the day that he came home and he did not feel good," she recalls. "He got COVID, I got COVID, my 2-year-old got COVID, my dad got COVID."She and her toddler didn't have any symptoms, but both her husband and dad got very sick."My husband went to the hospital first because he couldn't breathe. And then, three days later, my dad was having trouble breathing, so I took him to the same hospital," she says. "All the doctors were asking me, 'If they need to be ventilated, are you OK with that?' Thankfully, neither one of them had to be, but it was the most stressful time of my life."More than a year later, both men still have health problems. Her dad was recently back in the hospital with pneumonia and congestive heart failure — aftereffects from COVID-19, Cuellar says. Her husband has had trouble breathing too, and he has had to use an asthma inhaler for the first time in years.Rent is unaffordable for a lot of people right now. One in every 4 renters has had trouble paying rent in the last several months, according toNPR's recent pollwith the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health."There's a saying that 'the rent eats first,' " Leifheit says. "People take on all kinds of work to avoid that eviction — and that might actually drive up the risk of COVID."One way policymakers have tried to curb that financial stress is by making it illegal, at least for a time, for landlords to evict tenants when they can't pay rent. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued anationwide eviction moratorium, effective Sept. 4, 2020, citing these public health concerns. That moratorium was in effect until Aug. 26, 2021. States and cities issued their own eviction rules as well,some of which are still in place.These laws have been far from perfect. There have been loopholes and workarounds, and some tenants certainly have had to leave their homes.Even so, Leifheit has found in her research thatthese policies do help. In March 2020, nearly all states blocked evictions. Over the next few months, some states kept those eviction rules in place, and others let evictions start back up again. Leifheit and her collaborators looked at the six-month-period — from March 13 to Sept. 3, 2020 — and compared coronavirus infections and deaths for states that permitted evictions with states that did not."We found that states that ended their moratoriums saw over 430,000 more cases and over 10,000 more deaths than they would have if they had maintained their moratoriums," she says. These results held true even when the scientists took into account the effect of other measures known to curb viral spread, such as mask mandates in public places and shelter-in-place orders.Those cases of illness and death cast a pall across whole communities, Leifheit notes — the impact is not restricted solely to the people who have insecure housing situations.And outlawing evictions is only one piece of the solution, she adds. Giving renters money, through rental and utility assistance programs, so they are able to settle their debts and pay rent and utilities going forward is another approach that can work to keep people in their homes. Still, these policies are mostly geared toward people who are trying to stay put.For people who aren't in their own place to begin with, finding and moving into stable housing can be an even bigger challenge.John Stangel, for example, was living in a hostel in Philadelphia when the pandemic hit. He's now 55 years old and is a plumber by training. When construction jobs shut down in early 2020, he left Pennsylvania to find work in the D.C. area and ended up moving to Maryland.When construction jobs shut down early in the pandemic last year, John Stangel moved from Pennsylvania to Maryland in search of work around the District of Columbia. As far as he knows, he says, he never got sick with COVID-19, but as he moved in with friends and then later to a crowded shelter, his risk of catching the coronavirus, especially before the vaccine was available, was high.Alyssa Schukar for NPRhide captionWhen construction jobs shut down early in the pandemic last year, John Stangel moved from Pennsylvania to Maryland in search of work around the District of Columbia. As far as he knows, he says, he never got sick with COVID-19, but as he moved in with friends and then later to a crowded shelter, his risk of catching the coronavirus, especially before the vaccine was available, was high."To me, there was just a blanket risk" of getting COVID-19, he says. Whether he was at a crowded shelter, working at a job or staying with friends, he says, he was at high risk everywhere he went. He didn't have a door he could close against the outside world to keep the coronavirus at bay.Now Stangel is vaccinated, and as far as he knows, he says, he never got COVID-19 — to his amazement. He's now living just outside Washington, D.C., in an emergency shelter in Rockville, Md., that was quickly set up in an empty office building owned by the city. Even though people in that county were shielded from eviction because of the pandemic, there were still more people needing emergency shelter than ever. So the Montgomery County Coalition for the Homeless more than tripled its number of beds — from 60 to 200 — and moved some of the clients it was helping into the building where Stangel now lives.Stangel is very happy with the shelter. There's food, laundry machines and a closet with donated extra clothes for anyone in need, plus ready access to dentists, doctors and counselors. The bunks and mattresses on the floor are socially distanced, and to keep air circulating, the shelter staff added temporary clear plastic ducts along the ceiling.Stangel is currently staying in a building in Rockville, Md., that was converted into an emergency shelter during the pandemic, as increased financial stress forced more people out of their homes.Alyssa Schukar for NPRhide captionStangel is currently staying in a building in Rockville, Md., that was converted into an emergency shelter during the pandemic, as increased financial stress forced more people out of their homes.Even though he's vaccinated and comfortable with the shelter's policies to prevent viral transmission, Stangel says he also knows sharing your living space with dozens of other people during a pandemic is risky. He wants to get his own place, but it's expensive."Usually, to get into a room, it's somewhere between $1,200 to $1,800 to get in," he says of the Rockville area. He has just gotten a job working 40 hours per week, bought a small car and begun saving money for that rented room."What I'm trying to do now is save up enough money so I can get the first month's rent and the deposit — and maybe have a month to fall back on," he says.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

Fallon/AFP via Getty Imageshide captionA health care worker prepares a dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine during a clinic held at the Watts Juneteenth Street Fair in the Watts neighborhood of Los Angeles.The Food and Drug Administration authorized booster doses of the COVID-19 vaccines made by Moderna and Johnson & Johnson following unanimous votes by a committee of independent advisers backing the boosters last week.In a related decision, the FDA also authorized boosters that differ from the vaccine originally used to immunize a person against COVID-19. So, for instance, a person who got a Johnson & Johnson vaccine could receive one from Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech as a booster.The regulatory moves open the gate for boosters to be used more widely. In September, theFDA authorized a booster dose of the PfizerCOVID-19 vaccine."The available data suggest waning immunity in some populations who are fully vaccinated," said the FDA's acting commissioner, Dr. Janet Woodcock, in a statement. "The availability of these authorized boosters is important for continued protection against COVID-19 disease."On Thursday, a committee of advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is scheduled to meet to discuss COVID-19 vaccine booster shots and make recommendations on their use. The CDC director makes the final call on vaccine guidelines. After the CDC issues its guidance, the rollout can begin officially.Astudy of the mix-and-match approach, funded by the National Institutes of Health, found no safety concerns in using a different vaccine as a booster. The boosts with a mixed vaccine combination were at least as good in stimulating antibodies as matched vaccines, the study found, and in some cases the mixed approach appeared much better.By blessing the use of a mixed vaccine combination, the FDA makes it easier to give booster shots in nursing homes where residents haven't all received the same original vaccines."From a public health perspective, there's a clear need in some situations for some individuals to receive a different vaccine," said Dr. Amanda Cohn, chief medical officer at the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, during an FDA meeting Friday.The decision could also make it easier for a wide range of people to get a booster, since any available shot would do.Dr. Mark Sawyer, a committee member from Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, cited ease of access under the mix-and-match approach during the committee's deliberations. "I'm sold already," he said, "and that's because I agree completely with Dr. Cohn's comments that we need flexibility and improved access for everybody, which the flexibility of being able to mix and match will allow."The Moderna authorization covers a booster for people who were immunized with the company's two-shot vaccine at least six months beforehand and who are 65 years or older, are 18 to 64 and at high risk of severe COVID-19 or are in the same age group and whose work or institutional exposure puts them at high COVID-19 risk.The authorization comes after acommittee of advisers to the FDA voted 19-0in support of the booster last Thursday. The scope of the Moderna authorization matches the one the FDA gave to Pfizer COVID-19 booster doses in September.One difference: Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine booster is half the dose of the initial shots used in its two-shot vaccination — 50 micrograms of mRNA versus 100 micrograms per each initial shot. The Pfizer vaccine uses a third identical dose.The FDA also authorized abooster dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccineat least two months after initial immunization for people 18 and older. A study published by the CDC in September showed that the J&J vaccine had an effectiveness of around 68% in keeping people out of the hospital for COVID-19 compared with more than 90% for Moderna's vaccine and about 77% for the Pfizer vaccine after about four months.Several committee members noted that people were getting booster doses and using a mix-and-match approach on their own."Many Americans are taking matters into their own hands," said Dr. Ofer Levy, a professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School. "I'm reading in the media that people are getting boosters or mixing different products through their primary care providers, or not revealing what they got before. In the real world, all these kinds of combinations of extra boosters are already happening."More than 9 million people have received a Pfizer booster,according to datafrom the CDC. Even before the FDA's authorization of Moderna and J&J boosters, CDC data show that more than 1.6 million people have received a Moderna booster and more than 11,000 another shot of J&J's vaccine.Ofer asked the FDA to act quickly: "I think it's a matter of some urgency for FDA to help sort out what is admittedly a complicated and challenging scenario. We can't hide from it. And I do think we need to give guidance to the public."Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Will StoneDaniel WoodHouston Fire Department paramedics prepare to transport a COVID-19 positive woman to a hospital on September 15, 2021 in Houston, Texas. While the virus is still rampant in the U.S., some vaccinated people will continue to get infected.John Moore/Getty Imageshide captionHouston Fire Department paramedics prepare to transport a COVID-19 positive woman to a hospital on September 15, 2021 in Houston, Texas. While the virus is still rampant in the U.S., some vaccinated people will continue to get infected.When Colin Powell died this week from complications related to COVID-19, it was a shock to many Americans.Though scientists and federal health officials are adamant that the vaccines work well to protect against hospitalization and death, it's unnerving to hear of fully vaccinated people like Powell, or perhaps your own friends and neighbors, falling severely ill with COVID-19.So how welldothe vaccines work? How serious is the risk of a serious breakthrough infection, one that could land you in the hospital?In Powell's case, of course, there are several reasons he was at higher risk. He was 84 and had been treated in recent years for multiple myeloma — a blood cancer that forms in plasma cells, which are critical for the immune system. These facts alone would put him at very high risk for a breakthrough illness, says Dr.Rachel Bender Ignacio, who directs COVID-19 clinical research at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center."We shouldn't change our risk estimation on one good or bad outcome that happens to a single person," she says. "The vaccines are still holding up extremely well."Even with concerns about the possibility of waning protection from the vaccine, scientists say the best data in the U.S. still tell a clear story: people who are fully vaccinated have a far lower risk of getting infected or dying from COVID-19 than the unvaccinated, according to data representing about 30% of the U.S. population from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Loading...Those who do have severe breakthrough illnesses tend to be older or have serious underlying health conditions, or a combination of those risk factors."People who are of advanced age or who have impaired immune systems always respond less well to vaccines — that's true whether it's flu vaccine or really any other vaccine," says Bender Ignacio.The effect of age on the risk of breakthrough infections is stark. The CDC released data separating breakthrough infections and deaths by age. Among fully vaccinated people, those aged 80 or older had a almost 13 times greater risk of dying from COVID than people of all ages. However unvaccinated people in their 80s were at far greater risk than vaccinated ones.Loading...Research shows that people who fare the worst tend to be especially medically fragile. Astudy of vaccinated patientshospitalized at the Yale New Haven Health System found that the median age was about 80 and many had underlying problems, including cardiovascular disease, lung disease, diabetes and some were also on immunosuppressive drugs.While those findings came before the surge of the delta variant,Dr. Hyung Chun, who led the study, says their ongoing research shows these types of patients still account for most breakthrough illnesses "even with the shifting landscape of breakthrough infections."Chun says those who are vaccinated generally tend to do better once they are in the hospital, compared to those who aren't vaccinated."Even if you were hospitalized [with a breakthrough infection], the trend we've been observing is that you will likely be far less sick in terms of needing things like supplementary oxygen or mechanical ventilation, or even your risk of death," says Chun, an associate professor of cardiology at the Yale School of Medicine.As of mid July, the CDC found that people who were immunocompromisedaccounted for 44% of breakthrough hospitalizations— a figure that supported the decision to recommend a third shot of the vaccine to people who met the criteria of having a weakened immune system. Amore recent studyconducted by the vaccine maker Pfizer and not yet peer reviewed, found that study participants who were immunocompromised accounted for about 60% of the breakthrough hospitalizations and were three times more likely to have an infection compared to people who weren't immunocompromised.The three major clinical trials done by the vaccine makers did not include immunocompromised people, so researchers are still trying to tease apart how different medical conditions affect a person's immune response to the vaccine, saysDr. Jonathan Golob, an assistant professor at the University of Michigan in the Division of Infectious Diseases."The vaccines are still stellar, including against delta for just about everyone, except for people with very, very impaired immune systems," he says. That list includes patients who've had an organ transplant, with active cancer, or some other severe autoimmune disease that requires a lot of medicine to treat it. "All those people, I would say, still need to be cautious and the best thing to protect them is to have everyone around them vaccinated," he says.It's currently hard to answer that in the U.S. To date, 7,178 people arereported to have diedfrom COVID-19 after being vaccinated and about 85% were 65 and older, according to the CDC, but these figures are meant to be a "snapshot" and are an undercount, an agency spokesperson told NPR. In that same time period, approximately 190 million have been fully vaccinated in the U.S.As more Americans get vaccinated, the raw numbers of serious breakthrough infections will inevitably increase as long as the virus is spreading, but those figures can be misleading."Hospitalizations due to breakthrough infection are higher than even a few months ago, but this should be viewed in light of the fact that more people are fully vaccinated," says Chun. "You're working with a much bigger denominator of patients."Bottom line: The risks of hospitalization are far greater for the unvaccinated. Thechance of being hospitalizedin the U.S. for COVID-19 is 12 times higher if you are unvaccinated, according to recent CDC data. These rates may vary week to week, the agency notes. And they vary by age group. Unvaccinated adults aged 18-49 were 14 times more likely to be hospitalized, while those over 65 were 9 times more likely.Some of the most compelling data also comes directly from what hospitals are seeing in their communities.A study ofhospitalized COVID-19 patients at Beaumont Health— Michigan's largest hospital system — found a "dramatic" difference in hospital visits between the vaccinated and unvaccinated, saysDr. Amit Bahl, an emergency physician who authored the study."If you were fully vaccinated, you had a 96% reduction in the chance of being hospitalized or going to the emergency room," he says. "A bad outcome for a patient that's fully vaccinated was exceedingly rare."Some states that track breakthrough hospitalizations are finding a similar pattern.For example, New York'sdata showsthat 0.06% of the vaccinated population has ended up in the hospital for COVID-19. Minnesota has asimilar rate.However, it's still hard to quantify how often a breakthrough infection leads to someone being hospitalized, because the U.S. is not tracking this data closely on a national level, saysAngela Rasmussen, a virologist at the University of Saskatchewan."I don't think we're there yet," she says. "We don't really know the denominator — how many breakthrough infections there have been overall."The push for booster shots reflects the concern that certain groups of Americans — namely those who are older — appear to be nowslightly less protectedagainst a severe case of COVID-19 than they were in the spring, and worries that the risk of infections has risen because of the delta variant. The data vary between the vaccines. The one shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine appears to be the least effective against hospitalization.But scientists are still trying to untangle exactly what's behind this increased risk.Older Americans were already more susceptible to the virus. They were also some of the first groups to get vaccinated. "So we have not only a higher risk population, but now a longer time since they received the vaccine," says Bender Ignacio. "And this is exactly why boosters have been recommended for those populations."The arrival of the delta variant and a surge in cases among the unvaccinated has put many more people in contact with the virus, including people who may be especially vulnerable, says Rasmussen."Unfortunately, even though we have a lot more people getting vaccinated, it's still not enough and we still have a lot of virus around," she says. "When those two conditions are met, you're just going to have more breakthrough cases."Ultimately, the protection against hospitalization — while it may be waning for some groups — doesn't appear to have translated into a major spike of severely sick vaccinated patients, even as the country has dealt with a huge surge in cases."Everyone I've seen this week who is critically ill from COVID is unvaccinated," says Golob of the University of Michigan health care system.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

The FDA's independent advisory committee meeting is scheduled for Oct. 26, and the CDC's independent advisory committee meeting is set for Nov. 2 and 3.The Pfizer vaccine currently has full approval for use in adults, and the federal government has authorized it for emergency use in children ages 12 to 17.White House officials said they were announcing the plan to inoculate children ages 5 to 11 before the vaccine was approved for that age group so they could be "operationally ready" to deploy the doses as soon as the approval came.Under the plan, the administration will work with state and local leaders to make the vaccine available at more than 25,000 pediatricians' offices and primary care sites and 100 children's hospital systems as well as pharmacies, schools and community health centers.The administration also will roll out a national public education campaign to inform parents and guardians about the vaccine and solicit questions.U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy said the campaign would help head off one of the barriers to vaccinating both children and adults — misinformation about the drug."That's why we're making sure that it's trusted messengers with scientific credibility who go out there and talk about these vaccines," Murthy said. "But it is our collective responsibility — whether we're in government, in the media, whether we're individuals — to help prevent the flow and spread of misinformation online."Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
The Associated PressSouthwest Airlines will let unvaccinated employees keep working past early December instead of putting them on unpaid leave if they apply for an exemption on medical or religious grounds.Morry Gash/APhide captionSouthwest Airlines will let unvaccinated employees keep working past early December instead of putting them on unpaid leave if they apply for an exemption on medical or religious grounds.DALLAS — Southwest Airlines will let unvaccinated employees keep working past early December instead of putting them on unpaid leave if they apply for an exemption on medical or religious grounds.Federal contractors — including major U.S. airlines – face a Dec. 8 deadline to require employees to get vaccinated against COVID-19.Southwest spokeswoman Brandy King said Tuesday that employees must submit proof that they got the shots, or file a request for an exemption from vaccination, by Nov. 24. Employees whose requests have not been processed or approved by Dec. 8 will be allowed to keep working, she said.The company backtracked from a previous position that employees who had not been vaccinated or received an exemption would be put on unpaid leave."While we intend to grant all valid requests for accommodations, in the event a request is not granted, the company will provide adequate time for an employee to become fully vaccinated while continuing to work and adhering to safety protocols," King said.Southwestnotified employees of the deadline delay on Friday.American Airlinessaid Tuesday that workers who are granted medical or religious exemptions will probably have to wear face masks and undergo regular testing, but the airline is still working on details."American will not be placing any team members on unpaid leave as part of the federal vaccine mandate," said American Airlines spokesman Matt Miller.Southwest and American are both based in Texas, where the Republican governor has ordered businesses not to require employees or customers to be vaccinated. Both say they will comply with President Joe Biden's federal mandate that contractors require vaccination, which they believe has legal priority over state orders.Southwest Chairman and CEO Gary Kelly originally said in a statement that Southwest "must join our industry peers in complying with the federal government's COVID-19 vaccination directive."In the days after that statement, however, the pilots' union asked a judge to temporarily block the order, saying Southwest should negotiate with the union over the issue. A hearing is scheduled Friday in federal court. This week, anti-mandate protesters demonstrated at the airline's headquarters.Kelly has indicated personal reluctance about the vaccine mandate."We are not going to fire any employees over this," he told ABC-TV last week. "We are urging all our employees to get vaccinated. If they can't get vaccinated, we're urging them to seek an accommodation."United Airlines, the first U.S. carrier to announce a vaccine requirement for employees, has started termination proceedings against about 200 employees who neither got the shots nor asked for an exemption.Chicago-based United has 67,000 U.S. employees. It says 96% have been vaccinated and 3% — about 2,000 employees — have applied for an exemption. United is waiting for a judge in Texas to rule on a lawsuit by employees challenging the airline's decision to put employees on unpaid leave if they get an exemption.Delta Air Lines Inc. has a less stringent policy. Even though it is a federal contractor, Delta says it will let workers undergo regular testing if they don't want to be vaccinated, but they face a $200 monthly surcharge on their health insurance. CEO Ed Bastian said last week that 90% of Delta employees are vaccinated and he expects that figure to reach 95% in November.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Becky SullivanChicago police officers salute city flag on Aug. 18.Charles Rex Arbogast/APhide captionChicago police officers salute city flag on Aug. 18.For hundreds of public employees in the state of Washington, where a new vaccine mandate for state employees went into effect this week, Monday was their last day on the job. That includes a sergeant with the Washington State Patrolwho told KUOW that he had made an appointment to turn in his patrol car and equipment.In Los Angeles County, Sheriff Alex Villanueva announced earlier this month thathe would not carry out the county's mandatefor his department's 18,000 employees, warning that the nation's most populous county could lose "5, 10% of my workforce overnight."And in Chicago, the clash between police and city officials over the city's vaccine mandate has grown so contentious thata judge ordered the local union president to stop making public statementsafter the city's attorney accused him of "municipal sedition and treason."As vaccine mandates for public employees begin to take effect across the country, police officers and the unions that represent them are putting up a fight, frustrating officials who say their goal is to minimize deaths as the COVID-19 pandemic drags on."More police officers die of COVID than they do in other causes of death, so it doesn't make any sense to not try to protect yourself as well as the colleagues that you work with," Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease official, said in an interview onFox News Sunday.More than 230 police officers in the U.S. have died of COVID-19 so far in 2021, more than quadruple the number of deaths by gunfire, according to the Officer Down Memorial Page, a group that tracks on-duty police deaths. Last year, the coronavirus killed nearly 250 officers nationwide, includingfour in Chicago."I want to make sure that our officers who are literally working their tails off every single day, risking life and limb, are absolutely able to take advantage of this lifesaving vaccine," Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot said at a news  conference Monday.As of Monday,79% of all city employeeshad complied with Lightfoot's order to submit their vaccination status, officials said. But about a third of employees in the Chicago Police Department — more than 4,500 total, including sworn officers and civilian employees — refused.The city's Fraternal Order of Police, led by its president, John Catanzara, had repeatedly encouraged officers to not comply with the city's requirement that all municipal employees share their vaccination status by last Friday's midnight deadline. That led to his admonishment by a judge Friday.Employees who do not report their status, including police officers, will not be paid, the mayor said Monday.According to WBEZ, an internal memo sent over the weekend warned department employees that if they do not comply with the policy, they could be fired.More than 20 states have implemented some form of vaccine mandate for state employees, and many major municipalities have put them in placeas well.Vaccine mandatesare effectiveat getting people vaccinated, which in turn reduces serious illness and death from COVID-19. Major companies such as United Airlines and Tyson Foods announced mandates and have since reported that the vast majority of their employees are vaccinated. In Washington, Gov. Jay Inslee said last week that more than 90% of state workers have been vaccinated.But police officers have consistently resisted the vaccine at higher rates than the general public. Combined with rising levels of crime — violent crime was up about 5% overall in 2020, with murders up nearly 30% — police unions have begun to raise concerns that tough enforcement of the mandates could result in staffing shortages.In Seattle, detectives and other non-patrol officers were dispatched to emergency calls last week,according to local TV station KOMO.In Massachusetts, where Gov. Charlie Baker's vaccine mandate took effect Monday, at least 150 state police officers have resigned or submitted paperwork to do so, according to the union, though the state has not yet confirmed those numbers. Roughly 85% of state police officers are vaccinated, but union officials say the resignations are exacerbating an already difficult staffing situation."Critically low staffing is the single largest threat to public safety today," said Michael Cherven, president of the State Police Association of Massachusetts, at a news conference on Monday. "We are in dire need of courageous leadership that places public safety above politics."Across the country, opponents have filed lawsuits hoping to block the vaccine mandates, but there's a long history of them passing legal muster.Many of the suits have already been rejected by judges, including the Supreme Court declining emergency appeals byteachers in New York Cityanduniversity students in Indiana.A previous photo caption incorrectly stated that police officers were saluting the state flag. In fact, they are saluting the Chicago city flag.A previous photo caption incorrectly stated that police officers were saluting the state flag.

Williams said in a recent Instagram video that she is leaving ESPN due to the company's vaccine mandate.ESPN college basketball and football reporter Allison Williams has joined a small minority of workers who have quit or been fired from their jobs over avaccine mandate."I have been denied my request for accommodation by ESPN and the Walt Disney Company, and effective next week, I will be separated from the company," she said in a video posted to Instagram on Friday.ESPN's parent company, Disney, had announced a vaccine mandate over the summer with a deadline of this Friday, Oct. 22.In early September, Williams shared on Twitter that she'd decided not to get a COVID-19 vaccine while she and her husband were trying to have a second child."Taking the vaccine at this time is not in my interest," she wrote.The CDChas urged peoplewho are pregnant or might become pregnant to get vaccinated, saying there is currently no evidence showing COVID-19 vaccines cause fertility problems and no data pointing to an increased risk of miscarriage among people who received an mRNA vaccine during pregnancy.A post shared by Allison Williams (@allisonw_espn)In the Instagram video, Williams spoke of her medical apprehensions about receiving the vaccine and added, "I am also so morally and ethically not aligned with this.""Ultimately, I cannot put a paycheck over principle, and I will not sacrifice something that I believe and hold so strongly to maintain a career," she said in the video. "I'm going to pray things get better and that I can see you on the television set in some capacity in some stadium, covering some game soon."Williams, who had reported for ESPN since 2011, acknowledged she's not the only one walking away from a career or a profession they love.Hundreds of hospital workers have quit rather than get vaccinated, but they represent only a tiny fraction of employees overall. For example, Duke Health in North Carolina reported it had fired just 20 people out of a workforce of 23,000.Meanwhile, United Airlines said it is terminating a couple of hundred of its 67,000 employees who did not comply with the airline's vaccine mandate. Other employers that have imposed vaccine mandates are also reporting compliance rates topping 90%.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Alana WiseDemonstrators gather outside the Massachusetts State House in Boston to protest COVID-19 vaccination and mask mandates. The political divide on the issue is only deepening, as Republican leaders of other states take more steps to thwart mandates.Joseph Prezioso/AFP via Getty Imageshide captionDemonstrators gather outside the Massachusetts State House in Boston to protest COVID-19 vaccination and mask mandates. The political divide on the issue is only deepening, as Republican leaders of other states take more steps to thwart mandates.The science is clear: Vaccines are a safe and effective way to prevent serious illness, hospitalization and death from the coronavirus, andvaccine mandatesare an effective tool in promoting widespread vaccinations.Still, the battle to inoculate the nation against the coronavirus has reached a fever pitch in recent months. President Biden has focused on getting as many Americans as possible vaccinated against the coronavirus, most notably rolling out wide-reaching vaccine mandates for government employees andfor businesses with more than 100 workers.But Republicans have grown increasingly hostile to the notion of mandatory vaccines — despite vaccine mandates existing in the background in parts of the United Statessince the 19th century— and have parlayed the fight against COVID-19 into a political battle, with vaccine mandates as the latest frontier in the great American defense of freedom and liberty.These lawmakers decry the Biden administration's actions as government overreach, but now themselves are telling employers they can't impose mandates even if they want to.Take for example Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, who earlier this week issued anexecutive orderbanning mandatory vaccines within private companies."No entity in Texas can compel receipt of a COVID-19 vaccine by any individual, including an employee or a consumer, who objects to such vaccination for any reason of personal conscience, based on a religious belief, or for medical reasons, including prior recovery from COVID-19," Abbott wrote in his order.The order notes that vaccines are "encouraged" for those who are eligible but should remain "voluntary." Abbott is himself fully vaccinated against the virus andsurvived a brushwith COVID-19 this summer.Florida's Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis —  also vaccinated against the virus — has vowed to sue the Biden administration over its federal vaccine mandates. So far, he has made good on his promise to keep such orders out of Florida, havingpreviously fineda county in the state $3.5 million for imposing vaccine mandates on its employees."We're going to make sure people are able to make their own choices. We're not going to discriminate against people based on those choices, and you're going to have a right to operate in society," DeSantis said, painting the issue of vaccines as a matter of civil liberties.Most Americans have in fact received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine.A SeptemberPew Research studyfound that in August, 73% of American adults said they had received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, and a majority said they had received the full course of the vaccine.Among Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters, 86% said they were at least partially vaccinated against the virus, compared to 60% of Republicans. Unvaccinated Americansalso tend to be younger than 50 and less educated.For some of those who have not been vaccinated, the message from conservative leaders like Abbott and DeSantis about choice and liberty resonates, despite public health guidance on how to prevent serious illness and death from the coronavirus."Somehow it has morphed into not getting the vaccine as a way to defend their freedom and resist this 'tyranny,' " said Ken Resnicow, a professor in the school of public health at the University of Michigan. "There's not many countries that have this dynamic."Resnicow referenced a study on which he was the lead author that founda correlationbetween a person's belief in conspiracy theories and the apocalypse, and their willingness to actively prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Particularly among self-identified evangelicals, Resnicow has found a distinct rejection of the coronavirus vaccine, which he said has made vaccine hesitancy especially difficult to address."There's a sensitive issue — that it's conflated with religion and evangelicalism, and people are scared to touch that third rail. And I think we have to confront how religion and science are now at loggerheads, and that wasn't always the case," he said."There's this 30% of evangelicals for whom science is almost the enemy."Rupali Limaye, director of behavioral and implementation science at the International Vaccine Access Center based at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, has made similar findings as it relates to the difficulty of squaring public health realities with differences in political opinions."There is a really stark divide between states that have more heavily Democratic-leaning leadership versus those that have more heavily leaning Republican leadership," she said.Limaye said that particularly among Republicans, the idea of freedom — a core tenet of the American ideal — has given people a basis on which to pin anti-science rhetoric."This idea of liberty and autonomy — this comes up a lot as those underlying values of individuals that feel as though we don't really need to be mandating vaccines," she said,"I don't think it's an issue that they hate vaccines themselves. They hate the idea that vaccines are essentially forcing them into doing something they don't want to do. Vaccines are just sort of the casualty of all this."Niambi Carter, an associate professor of political science and Woodrow Wilson fellow at Howard University, said that Republican politicians have been exploiting the political expediency of vaccine hesitancy to advance their own political goals,an argument the White House has made as well."Unfortunately we have politicians who will participate in this kind of nonsense because it serves them politically, not necessarily because they believe it," Carter said, referencing the lawmakers' own vaccination status. "They're telling us to gamble our lives, but they're not willing to take that same gamble with theirs. And I think that is what is the most galling about this."Opposition to vaccine mandates may even be growing among Republicans.While Americans overall aregenerally favorableof Biden's new vaccine mandates for federal workers, Republicans specifically are not.Polling by the British market research firmYouGovpublished on Oct. 13 shows that fewer than half of Republicans — just 46% — support mandatory vaccines for children. That's a 13-percentage-point decline since August 2020,before the current fightover the coronavirus vaccine erupted.And when asked about the COVID-19 vaccine specifically, the difference is even more clear. An overwhelming majority of Democrats, 79%, are in favor of mandatory childhood vaccines against the virus and just 9% are opposed. This compared to just a quarter of Republicans who would support such a mandate, versus 63% who oppose it.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

"We've still got to use common sense," Lewis says. "Anything that can ward off suffering and death, I think, is a wonderful thing."In the end it was the delta variant that drove Rose Mitchell, 89, down the winding mountain road in Smilax, Ky., to the Full Gospel Church of Jesus Christ to get the shot. Her pastor, Billy Joe Lewis, had told his congregation that, No, ma'am, a COVID-19 vaccine would not leave the "mark of the beast" nor rewrite their genetic codes.Mitchell, who has known the deaths of eight of her 13 children over the years, was done taking chances with the virus stealing up the valleys along Cutshin Creek."That stuff's getting so bad, I was afraid to not take it," she says, sitting in her daughter's car in the church parking lot. "I said, 'Well, if all the rest of them are going to take it, I'll take it too.' "Kentucky is in the midst ofa COVID-19 wildfire that is sparing no part of the state; new case counts topped 4,000 a day for much of September, before easing somewhat this month. Hospital intensive care units are still at capacity in some regions, with COVID-19 patients occupyinghalf the beds. Gov. Andy Beshear has called the situation "dire."Across the nation, older people have been steadfast takers of the vaccines against COVID-19: About 95% of people 65 and older in the U.S. have received at least one shot. But geographic variations cloud that math.Older Kentuckians in rural hamletsfar from Louisville and Lexington, for example, are trailing in vaccination, with rates as low as 55% in Wayne County, on the Tennessee state line.While seniors are still more likely to be vaccinated than younger adults in Kentucky, the simple truth of the pandemic is that older people who forgo the shots face a far greater chance of severe sickness and death. People 60 and older account fornearly 90%of the 9,184 deaths in Kentucky related to COVID-19. Residents 80 and older account for 41% of deaths.In Leslie County, in the foothills of the rugged Pine Mountain ridge that anchors the state's eastern coalfields, gravel roads wind through thick forests blanketed with kudzu vines. House by house, church by church, public health workers are trying to outsmart the fantastical tales spread on Facebook about the COVID-19 vaccines, while also helping residents overcome the everyday hurdles of financial hardship and isolation."Some of our older people don't have access to vehicles because their family works," says Maxine Shepherd, a regional health coordinator for Leslie County and four-decade-long member of Full Gospel Church. Even for people who have a car, gas is expensive, she says, and trips from secluded dells to town are rationed out carefully.While Kentuckians watched the devastation of the pandemic's early months from afar, COVID-19 has long since made its arrival — and it hasn't spared the church on Cutshin Creek. In recent weeks, Lewis held a funeral service for a 53-year-old unvaccinated former coal miner, suspended Sunday services after more members fell ill and, with a heavy heart, canceled Homecoming — a cherished yearly gathering of area churches that marks the fall foliage with a celebration of the gospel and shared faith.Local health agencies have been eager to enroll churches in the all-hands-on-deck vaccination effort; older residents are more likely to attend religious services, and in communities like Smilax, ministers are trusted advisers.Some church leaders have refrained from encouraging vaccination, afraid of offending congregants in a state where mistrust of government intrusion runs deep. But not Lewis, who helped build Full Gospel Church on a rare flat parcel of land in 1972 and has led it ever since. Lewis, who has thick silver hair and a luminous smile, spends long stretches of the day in prayer, and he says God told him to protect his flock.When "Sister Maxine" from the regional health department suggested a drop-in vaccine clinic in the church parking lot, Lewis says, he was all in favor. He promoted it from the pulpit and on the church's must-readFacebook page."We've still got to use common sense," he says. "Anything that can ward off suffering and death, I think, is a wonderful thing.""We do not like to be shoved" by government directivesVexed by the slow uptake in vaccinations by some Americans, President Joe Biden has mandated shots,with certain exemptions, for health care workers in facilities such as hospitals and nursing homes, as well as for federal workers and employees of large companies. While the exact timing and details of the private-sector mandates are still being hammered out, the specter of coercion outrages many Kentuckians, particularly in Appalachia, where government directives have been met with derision."We do not like to be shoved," says David McKenzie, who grew up in Louisa, a once-booming coal town on the West Virginia border, and now owns the local nursing home. "We resent it, and we shove back."Opposition to the vaccines in Lawrence County, where thefully vaccinated rateis only around 39%, is not overtly political so much as defiant. "They're fearful of 'the Man,' " McKenzie says. "The Man could be your employer, it could be the government, it could be a newspaper reporter." People who boasted about refusing the vaccines cannot change their minds, or "they'll look like they're weak, or they caved to the Man."In nearby Salyersville, the virulence of the delta variant has shaken some holdouts. Santana Salyers, 22, braved torrential rain to get her shot at the county health department, a one-story building on a stretch of freshly paved road. In her third trimester of pregnancy, she feared the hospital would not let her hold her newborn if she wasn't vaccinated. Salyers works at the IGA grocery store and says to vax or not to vax comes up in conversation there almost every day. "I'm a fence-straddler," she says. But around town, "you're either against it or for it."Turnout for the recent Salyersville health fair was muted by the remnants of a tropical storm, but a few dozen people still showed up to get their COVID-19 shots. In the waiting room, vaccine takers received $25 Walmart cards and a chance to win a Fitbit or Instant Pot. The prizes were a big draw.James Shepherd, who is both the town's mayor and director of the Magoffin County Health Department, bemoans his county's 44% vaccination rate: "In a small community like this, they make up their mind 'yes' or 'no,' and that's it." What will it take to boost vaccinations? "A miracle," he says, with an exasperated laugh.Deaths of friends change some minds, but not others, as delta spreadsShepherd's close friend Carter Conley, the beloved captain of the county rescue squad, died last month of COVID-19, despite being vaccinated. Conley's death has been deeply felt around town, but also has given fuel to those who see vaccination as pointless.Doubts about the vaccines' effectiveness extend to nursing homes in Kentucky despite the persistent correlations between nursing home outbreaks and low vaccination rates among staff.On a mid-September weekday in Danville, a small city southwest of Lexington, residents at the Landmark of Danville Rehabilitation and Nursing Center sat on a quaint covered porch playing a game of 20 questions with the activities staff. At the time, 80% of the patients in the facility were fully vaccinated against COVID-19, according to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid, but only 28% of the center's health care personnel, who dashed out and back at lunchtime ferrying takeout fast food, had gotten their shots.A short drive away, the city's other nursing home, the Danville Centre for Health and Rehabilitation, also had a staff vaccination rate of 28% in September, according to federal records. (A month later, staff vaccination rates at both facilities are still below 60%.)The unprotected workforce did not faze one man who was moving his elderly father into Landmark that day. The man, who works as a registered nurse at the local hospital, and a family friend accompanying him did not want to give their names, but both said they doubt the vaccines' efficacy.The man's parents were vaccinated in March but fell ill with COVID-19 in August, he said. His mother was put on a ventilator and died; his father was still in the hospital recovering, and would soon be moved to the nursing home.The facility's low staff vaccination rate is "not necessarily pertinent," the man said, since his father would be receiving "end-of-life care." His companion said she personally knew four people who had died of COVID-19 and that two had been vaccinated and two had not. These cases, she said, "don't get reported because they don't fit the narrative." (The CDC estimatesunvaccinated people are at least 11 times more likely to die from a COVID-19 infection.)Standing on the porch amid festive fall decorations, Landmark's administrator, Cindy Hollins, declined to discuss what might account for her staff's low uptake and politely asked a reporter to leave.A different approach: "The safest nursing home in the state of Kentucky"In Louisa, Ky., three hours east of Danville, McKenzie believes the high rates of vaccination among residents and staff at his Jordan Center will be a selling point. "I advertise I'm the safest nursing home in the state of Kentucky to live and work in," he says.McKenzie and his sister lived in the nursing home as kids; their parents opened the home and couldn't find another house to rent when the town was overflowing with coal miners. He learned to play piano from a resident, by then down a few fingers from diabetes, who had once played in Duke Ellington's band.Last winter, COVID-19 ravaged the nursing home for months, infecting nearly every resident. An employee's 33-year-old daughter, who didn't want the vaccine, was buried in early September; then a former employee, who had quit to work at a hospital that didn't require vaccination, died."I'm not mean about it. I say, 'I really don't want you to be on a vent and die.' "Misty Robertson, R.N., Louisa, Ky., on trying to persuade co-workers to get vaccinated against COVID-19As soon as vaccines became available, McKenzie and his staff went room to room, explaining the science to residents. Only one family refused. Then he gathered the staff, many shaken by the loss of residents, who included family members and friends.Now, nearly every resident of the Jordan Center is vaccinated with three shots, and the staff vaccination rate hovers at 85%. But the holdouts keep McKenzie on edge."I sat over here on this front porch until 2 o'clock in the morning talking to two of the nurses that don't want to vaccinate," McKenzie says. "One has been here for 37 years and the other for 15 years. They're dug in. They're adamant."Testing staff members who refuse to get vaccinated falls to Misty Robertson, a registered nurse who has worked at the facility for decades. She views every interaction as a chance to educate her co-workers about why they should get the shot. "I'm not mean about it," she says. "I say, 'I really don't want you to be on a vent and die.' "Robertson's father, who lived at the Jordan Center, died of COVID-19 in January. Most of her family is vaccinated, including her three children and her husband, who works at Walmart. The exception is her twin sister, a receptionist for a local pediatrician. That sister tells Robertson COVID-19 is fake and "it's all because of Biden.""I get mad," says Robertson. She vehemently disputes the conspiracy theories circulating through the town's social networks. And she admits, with a sour laugh, that she sometimes goes too far. "I was put in Facebook jail."McKenzie's public stance in favor of vaccination has made him a pariah in some quarters, too. A customer attacked him at Walmart and threatened to wait for him in the parking lot. The darkened mood has carved the town into opposing camps, and McKenzie worries Biden's vaccine mandates will just stiffen that divide.Certainly, they are proving too much for some of his nursing home staffers. Many of the unvaccinated workers at the Jordan Center are on the same shift, and McKenzie fears he may lose his entire night crew."They told me Sunday night they were going to leave health care and work at Tractor Supply," he says, "where they can make more money per hour."This story comes to us fromKaiser Health News, a national, editorially independent program of the Kaiser Family Foundation.

Brown/AFP via Getty Imageshide captionNurse Christina Garibay administers Johnson & Johnson's COVID-19 vaccine to a man at a community outreach event in Los Angeles in August.A panel of experts voted unanimously to recommend that the Food and Drug Administration authorize a booster dose of the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine.In a 19-0 vote, the panel recommended that the booster dose come at least two months after initial immunization with one shot of the J&J vaccine. It applies to people 18 years and older.During the meeting, J&J presented data that showed the protection of the single shot remained largely stable over time but that a second dose pushed protection to a higher level.Dr. Peter Marks, director of FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said the morning's presentations by J&J didn't include other relevant information about why a booster might be valuable after the initial immunization. "There are data suggesting the effectiveness of the vaccine is actually less robust than the company's presentation here," he said.Marks then called on Dr. Amanda Cohn, a panelist who is also chief medical officer of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. She cited astudy published by the CDC in Septemberthat showed the J&J vaccine had effectiveness of around 68% in keeping people out of the hospital for COVID-19 compared with more than 90% for Moderna's vaccine and about 77% for the Pfizer-BioNTech after about four months.Cohn said the J&J vaccine's protection was substantially lower than the mRNA vaccines made by Moderna and Pfizer — even when waning of their protection is taken into account."I think, frankly, this was always a two-dose vaccine," said Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, during the panel discussion before the vote.The FDA isn't bound to follow the advisory panel's recommendation, but it usually does.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

The White House says Thursday that the U.S. will commit 17 million additional doses of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine to the African Union.The White House says the United States will donate more than 17 million doses of theJohnson & Johnson COVID-19vaccine from its domestic supplies to the African Union.President Biden made theannouncementThursday as he met with Kenyan Uhuru Kenyatta at the White House, Biden's first one-on-one meeting with an African leader."We're continuing our shared fight against COVID," Biden said during the meeting.The vaccine donation comes on top of the 50 million vaccines doses already donated by the United States to the African Union, according to the White House.The 17 million J&J vaccines will be available for delivery immediately and will be delivered to the African Union within the coming weeks.Kenyatta thanked Biden for assisting both Kenya and other African countries, saying that the U.S. has "stepped up" when it comes to vaccine donation and access to vaccines for other countries.News of Kenya's 17 million vaccine donation comes after the World Health Organization said last month the African continent wasalmost 500 million doses shortof what is needed to achieve its goal of vaccinating 40% of people by the end of 2021."African countries need clear delivery dates so they can plan properly. We also need strong structures set up to ensure that all promises made are promises kept," said Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, World Health Organization Regional Director for Africa in a statement addressing the shortage.To date, under half of the African countries that have received COVID-19 vaccines have fully vaccinated only 2% or less of their populations, according to theWHO.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Scott HensleyA nurse draws a vaccine dose from a vial of Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine at a community center in Bowie, Md., in March.Win McNamee/Getty Imageshide captionA nurse draws a vaccine dose from a vial of Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine at a community center in Bowie, Md., in March.A panel of advisers to the Food and Drug Administration on Thursday unanimously recommended that the agency authorize a booster dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine at least six months after completion of the initial two-dose regimen.The recommendation applies to people 65 years and older, those 18 to 64 who are at high risk of severe COVID-19 and those people in the same age group whose work or institutional exposure puts them at high COVID-19 risk.The recommendation mirrors the authorization that the FDA gave to Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 booster doses in September.The 19-0 vote came after presentations by representatives from the FDA and Moderna and committee discussion. The FDA typically follows the advice of its advisory committees, though it isn't required to.Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine booster is half the dose of the initial shots used in its two-shot vaccination — 50 micrograms of mRNA versus 100 micrograms per each initial shot.To set the stage, Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, made introductory remarks as the meeting got underway Thursday morning. "It's important to remember that the vaccines still provide strong protection against serious outcomes, especially for younger age groups," he said. "The vaccine effectiveness against mild to moderate disease does appear to wane over time for the different vaccines. And we do need to account for the fact that mild to moderate COVID-19 can be associated with adverse outcomes, such as blood clots and long COVID-19, even in those who have breakthrough infections after vaccination."The panelheard from researchers from Israel who gave an updateon the experience with the Pfizer-BioNTech booster, which uses the same kind of mRNA technology as Moderna's vaccine."The administration of the booster dose helped Israel dampen infections and severe cases in the fourth wave," said Dr. Sharon Alroy-Preis, director of public health services at the Israeli Ministry of Health. An analysis of side effects, including heart inflammation, was reassuring, she said, especially for the most worrisome problems. "I'm very confident about the serious events."Several of the committee members said the Israeli data sheds important light on the role of boosters and was persuasive.Some committee members said consistency with the previous action on the Pfizer-BioNTech booster was important too."I support this [emergency use authorization] because we've already approved it for Pfizer, and I don't see how we can possibly not approve it for Moderna and not have most U.S. folks completely confused," said Dr. Stanley Perlman of the University of Iowa. "I think it's a pragmatic issue."Just before the committee voted, Dr. Eric Rubin, editor-in-chief ofThe New England Journal of Medicine, acknowledged that there was incomplete information and some unanswered questions about the Moderna booster. "The data are not perfect," he said, "but these are extraordinary times and we have to work with imperfect data."After the vote, the panel discussed a separate question posed by the FDA: Should use of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna boosters be expanded to the general population younger than 65 (but at least 18)? The expert panel wasn't inclined to support that.The FDA's Marks acknowledged that there was not much appetite for lowering the age range much, if at all, for general boosting.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

The Indonesian resort island of Bali welcomed international travelers to its shops and white-sand beaches for the first time in more than a year Thursday - if they're vaccinated, test negative, hail from certain countries, quarantine and heed restrictions in public.Firdia Lisnawati/APhide captionA beach vendor sets chairs as he waits for customers in Kuta beach in Bali, Indonesia, on Thursday. The Indonesian resort island of Bali welcomed international travelers to its shops and white-sand beaches for the first time in more than a year Thursday - if they're vaccinated, test negative, hail from certain countries, quarantine and heed restrictions in public.DENPASAR, Indonesia — The Indonesian resort island of Bali reopened for international travelers to visit its shops and white-sand beaches for the first time in more than a year Thursday — if they're vaccinated, test negative, hail from certain countries, quarantine and heed restrictions in public.However, foreign visitors may be slow to arrive. No international flights to Bali were scheduled on the first day of the reopening and a tourism official forecast travel would pick up in November.Bali's airport will welcome new foreign arrivals from 19 countries that meet World Health Organization's criteria such as having their COVID-19 cases under control, Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan, the government minister who leads the COVID-19 response in Java and Bali, said in a statement late Wednesday.He said all international flight passengers must have proof they've been vaccinated two times, test negative for the coronavirus upon arrival in Bali and undergo a 5-day quarantine at designated hotels at their own expense. They'll also have to follow stringent rules at hotels, in restaurants and on beaches."We have to do this with caution because we need to stay alert," Pandjaitan said.President Joko Widodo credited Bali's high vaccination rate for the decision to reopen. The country's COVID-19 caseload has also declined considerably; Indonesia has had around 1,000 cases a day in the past week after peaking around 56,000 daily in July.Tourism is the main source of income on the idyllic "island of the gods" that is home to more than 4 million people, who are mainly Hindu in the mostly Muslim archipelago nation. Bali's tourist areas were deserted two decades ago after visitors were scared off by deadly terror attacks that targeted foreigners, but the island has worked to overcome that image.More than 6 million foreigners arrived in Bali each year prior to the pandemic.Foreign tourist arrivals dropped six-fold from 6.2 million in 2019 to only 1 million in 2020, while 92,000 people employed in tourism lost their jobs and the average room occupancy rate of classified hotels in Bali was below 20%. Statistics Indonesia data showed the island's economy contracted 9.31% year-on-year last year.After closing the island to all visitors early in the pandemic, Bali reopened to Indonesians from other parts of the country in the middle of last year. That helped the island's gross domestic product grow a modest 2.83% in the second quarter this year, ending five consecutive quarters of contraction.An airport worker marks queue line for the reopening of International Ngurah Rai Airport in Bali, Indonesia, Thursday.Firdia Lisnawati/APhide captionAn airport worker marks queue line for the reopening of International Ngurah Rai Airport in Bali, Indonesia, Thursday.The July surge, fueled by the delta variant, again totally emptied the island's normally bustling beaches and streets. Authorities restricted public activities, closed the airport and shuttered all shops, bars, sit-down restaurants, tourist attraction spots and many other places on the island. It reopened to domestic travelers in August.Sang Putu Wibawa, the general manager at Bali's Tandjung Sari Hotel, said only two of its 40 rooms were occupied on average and he hoped the reopening would help the occupancy rate back to normal."We have been waiting for this moment for so long," he said. "This outbreak has hammered the local economy ... we are very excited to welcome foreign guests by observing health protocols."Widodo said deciding to reopen Bali was based on its high vaccination rate as well as wanting to revive its economy. He said more than 80% of the Bali population has been fully vaccinated."Based on this situation, I am optimistic and we have decided to reopen international flights to Bali," Widodo wrote in his official Instagram on Saturday.Overall, 59.4 million of Indonesia's 270 million people are fully vaccinated and another 43.2 million are partially vaccinated. Indonesia has confirmed more than 4.2 million cases and 142,811 deaths from COVID-19, the most in Southeast Asia.Tourists from 19 countries are now able to visit the Bali and Riau islands provinces — Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, New Zealand, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, China, India, Japan, South Korea, Liechtenstein, Italy, France, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Poland, Hungary, and Norway.The tight timing is one reasons tourists were not immediately arriving, said Putu Astawa, head of the Bali Tourism OfficeAirlines need time to schedule flights to Bali, while tourists need time to arrange travel documents such as tickets, insurance and virus tests as well as their five-day quarantine accommodations.He predicted new visitors would start coming in early November.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
James DawsonFromHospitals in Idaho, like St. Luke's Boise Medical Center in Boise, remain full after the summer delta surge pushed many to their limits.Kyle Green/APhide captionHospitals in Idaho, like St. Luke's Boise Medical Center in Boise, remain full after the summer delta surge pushed many to their limits.Last month, Chelsea Titus, a 40-year-old mother of one in Boise, Idaho, needed surgery to relieve severepain from endometriosis. But hospitals there are so full of unvaccinated COVID-19 patients that doctors told her she'd have to wait.Nearly 1 in 5 American households has had to delay care for serious illnesses in the past few months, according toa new pollfrom NPR, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.Titus, who works for a tech company from the home she shares with her husband, her daughter and a labradoodle named Winston, previously had surgery for endometriosis in which doctors removed her uterus and one ovary. When the condition flared again in September, the pain was severe."Sometimes it feels like I am in active labor," she says.Endometriosis affects millionsof women in the U.S. when tissue that typically grows inside the uterus also grows outside it.When the initial medication that Titus received didn't help, she reached out to her on-call doctor."He said, 'If the hospitals weren't in the situation they were in, I would have you in for surgery today,' " she recalls.The situation in Idaho's hospitals has become dire. The facilities are so full of mostly unvaccinated COVID-19 patients that many can no longer operate normally.Several hospitals have had to ration care.Chelsea TitusChelsea Titus/Boise State Public Radiohide captionChelsea TitusJim Souza, chief physician executive at the largest of Boise's hospitals, St. Luke's, describes his institution's typical high standards of care as the net that allows doctors to perform high-wire medical acts every day.But now, "the net is gone and the people will fall from the wire," Souza says.Idaho has one of the lowest COVID-19 vaccination rates in the United States."As cancer clinicians, we're really frustrated," says Dr. Dan Zuckerman, medical director for St. Luke's Cancer Institute.Zuckerman says his staff has delayed surgery for some breast cancers that can likely be kept at an early and treatable stage with hormones."There's just no guarantees with that," he says, "and there will still be some cancers that biologically may break through."Zuckerman now spends half his day at the hospital to help his overloaded colleagues and says he can see only half as many patients at the clinic.Across town at Saint Alphonsus, Boise's slightly smaller hospital, another oncologist, Scott Pierson, says they haven't had to postpone any surgeries — yet.But standard cancer screenings, like colonoscopies, have been pushed back."We're already a state that, if you look at the statistics, lags in screening," Pierson says.The pulmonologists who usually perform lung biopsies at Saint Alphonsus, for example, are swamped right now, he says, trying to treat severe cases of COVID-19 in the intensive care unit.Lots of Americans face delays like the ones in Idaho, saysRobert Blendon, a pollster at the Harvard Chan School of Public Health."The numbers were much greater than we expected," Blendon says, "and the delta variant changed what was going on."The survey he helped run found that nearly 1 in 5 U.S. households reported not being able to get treatment for a serious illness in the past few months; most of them said they had negative health outcomes because of that."This is the United States," Blendon says. "You don't expect people with serious illnesses to say they cannot be seen for care."This data, he says, shows that health care systems need to boost their capacity ahead of the next pandemic or serious natural disaster.While Boise-area hospitals are bursting with COVID-19 patients, they've also had a surge in demand from people who've already delayed care during the pandemic.Pierson and Zuckerman say they've seen more advanced cancers than usual that could have been caught earlier; catching the malignancies sooner would likely have given patients a much higher chance of survival, they say.Pierson says he has suggested to patients they might take a less intense form of chemotherapy so they're less likely to need a hospital bed if complications arise.Meanwhile, though the immense pain Titus felt from her endometriosis was overwhelming, she says she couldn't get surgery anywhere in Boise to remove her remaining ovary.Her brother took the extraordinary step of chartering a private plane to take her to the California Bay Area for treatment instead."I guess I could have flown commercially, but it would've been really hard and embarrassing because I was, like, screaming in pain," she says.After landing, Titus went to an emergency room and an urgent care clinic and talked to multiple doctors before finding a surgeon in her insurance network with an open calendar.Hotel rooms, a rental car and her flight home added up to thousands of dollars out of pocket — all for a surgery she could have had at a hospital just a few minutes' drive from her home in normal times.She recognizes she's privileged to have been able to afford all she did to get treatment."It breaks my heart that most in Idaho don't have the ability to do that," Titus says.And even so, it was nearly two weeks after first experiencing the severe pain that she was able to find relief."It's amazing how much better I feel," she said two days after her surgery.But the situation has left her questioning just how much her friends and neighbors who have refused to wear masks or get the COVID-19 vaccine really care about their community — and whether she has a place in the state any longer."My husband and I used to say, 'We're never leaving Idaho,' " Titus says. "We love it here. It's an amazing place to live, and we've been looking at real estate in other states — because this just isn't OK."Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

The co-leader of the country's Maori Party has blasted the national government's recent departure from a zero-tolerance approach to the pandemic.Kai Schwoerer/Getty Imageshide captionA guard wearing a vest saying 'Maori warden' facilitates a COVID-19 testing center in Christchurch, New Zealand. The co-leader of the country's Maori Party has blasted the national government's recent departure from a zero-tolerance approach to the pandemic.The co-leader of New Zealand's Maori Party, Debbie Ngarewa-Packer, says the country's new COVID-19 strategyamounts to a "death warrant"for Indigenous communities.Earlier in October,the country announced it is easing coronavirus restrictionsin the largest city of Auckland. The decision was widely seen as moving away from a zero-tolerance approach to the pandemic, where a single coronavirus infection could trigger severe restrictions on public life. To date, only28 New Zealandersare confirmed to have died of COVID-19.But combating the Delta variant has proven more challenging. A seven-week lockdown in Auckland failed to bring cases in the latest outbreak down to zero."With this outbreak and Delta, the return to zero is incredibly difficult," said Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern in an Oct. 4 speech. "But that's OK ... elimination was important because we didn't have vaccines. Now we do. So we can begin to change the way we do things."Auckland's eased restrictions are still far tighter than what most Americans are used to, and 83% of New Zealand's population age 12 and over has now received at least one dose of a vaccine.Yet vaccination rates among Indigenous Maori people are far below national averages. Rates for New Zealand's Pacific peoples, who trace their heritage to islands in the Pacific Ocean, are higher — but also still below the national average.Ngarewa-Packer, who is also a member of New Zealand's parliament, said the plan showed "Maori were always expendable.""When a majority of Maori are not vaccinated, then that effectively is perceived by us on the ground as signing a death warrant," she told NPR's All Things Considered. "We are an Indigenous people that have survived colonization and all that comes with it, so sadly, we have some of the worst health statistics."Astudy in the New Zealand Medical Journal foundthat due to increased rates of comorbidities in Maori and Pacific Islander communities, as well "structural bias and systemic racism" in the healthcare system, an 80-year-old white New Zealander had the same predicted risk of hospitalization from COVID-19 as a roughly 60-year-old Maori patient, and a roughly 55-year-old Pacific patient.Indigenous Maori account for 16.5%of the country's roughly 5 million people, and Pacific peoples account for another 8.1%.According to thelatest government data, 62% of eligible Maori have had their first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, as compared with 77% of Pacific peoples and 83% of the general population. Those numbers fall to 39% of eligible Maori and 53% of eligible Pacific peoples with a second dose, compared with 59% of the eligible general population.Ngarewa-Packer said Maori communities weren't to blame for their lower-than-average vaccination rate."It starts basically with a high mistrust in government and authority," Ngarewa-Packer said, adding the vaccination campaign was designed with only the general population in mind."So [the vaccination campaign] started at 65-plus ... but in the Maori population, 70% of us are under the age of 40 [and] 25% of Maori are under the age of 20," she said. "So you've got this complete hit and miss with the public health system and the role of the vaccination program."Ngarewa-Packer noted that during the initial outbreak, Maori communities were able to "stand up their own responses" in the forms of checkpoints to control movement and extra resources for disadvantaged citizens."This time round, there has been a much more centralized approach, less support for Maori to be doing their own ground resistance to COVID," Ngarewa-Packer said.When asked at a press conference about the Maori Party calling the easing of COVID-19 restrictions a "modern form of genocide,"Prime Minister Ardern replied: "I disagree with that."She noted vaccination rates were very high for Maori aged over 50, but added: "We need to see those [vaccination] rates pick up ... and we're putting a huge amount of effort into that, as are our Maori providers as we speak."Collin Tukuitonga, an associate professor of public health at the University of Auckland of Pacific origin, told NPR that most public health experts had always believed the government would eventually relax restrictions, "but not until we have better vaccination rates for the groups most at risk."Tukuitonga noted the majority of cases in the most recent outbreak were among Māori and Pacific communities."People are worried that it will continue to affect predominantly Maori and Pacific people," he said. "And they will bear the brunt of the government's decision to transition out of the elimination strategy."Along with Ngarewa-Packer, Tukuitonga believes responsibility for low Maori and Pacific vaccination rates lie with the New Zealand government. However, he said the government had turned a corner on its vaccination strategy by targetingmarginalized communities."Finally, the government has given ... Maori community-owned providers, Maori community leaders, the resources and the support to offer vaccination services to their own communities," Tukuitonga said.He said there were now increased vaccination options, including mobile buses sent to vaccinate members of low-uptake communities."The criticism we have is that we should have done this from the beginning," he said.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

Some Aucklanders will be able to get their first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine aboard a 787 on Saturday.William West/AFP via Getty Imageshide captionAn Air New Zealand plane arrives at Auckland Airport on Aug. 9. Some Aucklanders will be able to get their first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine aboard a 787 on Saturday.Some lucky Kiwis will soon be able to board a plane for the first time in a while — to get their COVID-19 shot.Air New Zealand is transforming a Boeing 787 into a special vaccination clinic for Aucklanders on Saturday. It will be one of many clinics operating nationwide as part of"Super Saturday,"which New Zealand's government is billing as a day of action aimed at boosting the country's vaccination rate.Those with appointments can arrive at the Auckland Airport "bound for destination vaccination,"as the airline puts it. And they're not just getting protection against COVID-19 — they'll also be offered a glimpse of the hangar, free "inflight" snacks and a special commemorative boarding pass."People will board through the front door into Business Premier, where they will receive one dose of the Pfizer vaccine in their arm of choice," reads the Facebook event page. "They will then move through the cabin into Economy where a snack service will commence while they wait to disembark after the observation period."Face masks and physical distancing are required for the safety of customers and crew members, it adds.There are a limited number of seats, which people can book through the Ministry of Health's website. David Morgan, the airline's chief safety officer, called the event a "once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.""We know Aucklanders have been doing it tough recently and we hope the idea of boarding an international aircraft for the first time in a long while will lift some spirits – while also encouraging people to protect themselves," Morgan said, according to theNew Zealand Herald.Auckland has been in lockdownsince mid-August, when a single case was discovered there. The delta variant has since sent cases surging, withThe Associated Pressreporting that more than 1,600 confirmed cases had been associated with the outbreak as of Monday. That same day, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said Auckland would stay in lockdown for at least another week.New Zealand acknowledgedthis monththat its strategy of strict lockdowns and aggressive contact tracing would no longer enable it to eliminate the virus completely, as it had been able to do in the past.The government is now focusing on increasing vaccinations, including by rolling out new mandates for teachers and health care workers. Just over 50% of New Zealand's population has been vaccinated so far,according to datafrom Johns Hopkins University.Vaccinations will also be the ticket to international travel for cooped-up Kiwis: Air New Zealand announced a "no jab, no fly" policythis month. All inbound and outbound passengers over the age of 18 will be required to show proof of full vaccination, effective Feb. 1.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Jaclyn DiazIn this Oct. 14, 2020 file photo, United Airlines employees work at ticket counters in Terminal 1 at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago.Nam Y. Huh/APhide captionIn this Oct. 14, 2020 file photo, United Airlines employees work at ticket counters in Terminal 1 at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago.A federal judge in Texasordered United Airlinesto temporarily halt its plan to put unvaccinated employees on unpaid leave if they have requested an  exemption from the company's COVID-19 vaccine mandate.United Airlines announced Aug. 6 that the Chicago-based airline was requiring all 67,000 of its U.S.-based employees to be vaccinated. At the time, the airline said about 90% of pilots and 80% of flight attendants had already been vaccinated.But for the small portion of employees that refused to get a coronavirus vaccine and requested either a medical or religious exemption from United, the company said it would place those workers on unpaid leave.Six employees filed a federal lawsuit over this policy arguing unpaid leave is not a reasonable accommodation, but rather an adverse employment action.U.S. District Judge Mark Pittman responded to that lawsuit Tuesday by  ordering a temporary restraining order on United to hold off on removing any worker requesting those exemptions from the payroll. That's just until he can hear arguments in the case at a later date.Pittman's temporary restraining order expires on Oct. 26.United Airlines issued a statement,according to reports:"Vaccine requirements work and nearly all of United's U.S. employees have chosen to get a shot. For a number of our employees who were approved for an accommodation, we're working to put options in place that reduce the risk to their health and safety, including new testing regimens, temporary job reassignments and masking protocols."People and teachers protest against COVID-19 vaccine mandates outside the Manhattan Federal Court on Tuesday in New York.Eduardo Munoz Avarez/APhide captionPeople and teachers protest against COVID-19 vaccine mandates outside the Manhattan Federal Court on Tuesday in New York.American Airlines, Alaska Airlines and JetBluealso joined United Airlines in requiring employeesto be vaccinated against COVID-19.Research has shown that workplaces with vaccine mandates are seeing vaccination rates of 90% or higher, where even themost hesitanthave chosen to get the shots.But a minority of people are engaging in battles over these mandates as they pop up in the workplace as well as in other facets of everyday life.Major citiesincluding Los Angelesare implementing strict proof-of-vaccine ordinances for restaurants, gyms and other establishments. Los Angeles County employees were also required to be vaccinated by Oct. 1.ButLA County Sheriff Alex Villanueva saidhe has no intention of carrying out the mandate.The world of sports has also been affected by a major star's refusal to get vaccinated.Brooklyn Nets All-Star guard Kyrie Irvingwon't be allowed to practice or play in games, likely due to New York City's COVID-19 vaccine mandate for professional athletes. Irving dodged several questions from reporters earlier this month about his vaccination status.Pushback against these mandates is a global issue as well.This weekend, Italy's strict requirementfor workers to show proof of a coronavirus vaccine pushed opponents of the policy to protest. Demonstrations turned violent as some marchers caused damage across Rome.United Airlines has said that, for the most part, its vaccine mandate has been a success. The company has said that more than 99% of its U.S.-based employees had met the company's requirement to get vaccinated or have applied for a religious or medical exemption.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Joe PalcaGloria Clemons gives a COVID-19 vaccine to Navy veteran Perry Johnson at the Edward Hines, Jr. VA Hospital in Hines, Ill., in September.Scott Olson/Getty Imageshide captionGloria Clemons gives a COVID-19 vaccine to Navy veteran Perry Johnson at the Edward Hines, Jr. VA Hospital in Hines, Ill., in September.Conventional wisdom says that if you're vaccinated and you get a breakthrough infection with the coronavirus, you can transmit that infection to someone else and make that person sick.But new evidence suggests that even though that may happen on occasion, breakthrough infections might not represent the threat to others that scientists originally thought.Ross Kedl, an immunologist at the University of Colorado School of Medicine, will point out to anyone who cares to listen that basic immunology suggests the virus of a vaccinated person who gets infected will be different from the virus of an infected unvaccinated person.That's because vaccinated people have already made antibodies to the coronavirus. Even if those antibodies don't prevent infection, they still "should be coating that virus with antibody and therefore helping prevent excessive downstream transmission," Kedl says. And a virus coated with antibodies won't be as infectious as a virus not coated in antibodies.In Provincetown, Mass., this summer,a lot of vaccinated people got infectedwith the coronavirus, leading many to assume that this was an example of vaccinated people with breakthrough infections giving their infection to other vaccinated people.Kedl isn't convinced."In all these cases where you have these big breakthrough infections, there's always unvaccinated people in the room," he says.In arecent studyfrom Israel of breakthrough infections among health care workers, the researchers report that in "all 37 case patients for whom data were available regarding the source of infection, the suspected source was an unvaccinated person."It's hard to prove that an infected vaccinated person actually was responsible for transmitting their infection to someone else."I have seen no one report actually trying to trace whether or not the people who were vaccinated who got infected are downstream — and certainly only could be downstream — of another vaccinated person," Kedl says.There's new laboratory evidence supporting Kedl's supposition. Initially, most vaccine experts predicted that mRNA vaccines like the ones made by Pfizer and Moderna that are injected into someone's arm muscle would generate only the kinds of antibodies that circulate throughout the body.But that might not be the whole story."I think what was the big surprise here is that the mRNA vaccines are going beyond that," saysMichal Caspi Tal, until recently an instructor at Stanford University's Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine and now a visiting scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.What Talhas foundis that in addition to the circulating antibodies, there was a surprisingly large amount of antibodies in mucosal membranes in the nose and mouth, two of the primary entry points for the coronavirus.ImmunologistJennifer Gommermanof the University of Torontofound thisas well."This is the first example where we can show that a local mucosal immune response is made, even though the person got the vaccine in an intramuscular delivery," Gommerman says.If there are antibodies in the mucosal membranes, they would likely be coating any virus that got into the nose or throat. So any virus that was exhaled by a sneeze or a cough would likely be less infectious.Gommerman says that until now, it seemed likely that a vaccine that was delivered directly to the mucosal tissue was the only way to generate antibodies in the nose or throat."Obviously a mucosal vaccination would be great too. But at least we're not sitting ducks," Gommerman says.  "Otherwise everyone would be getting breakthrough infection."Now, these studies by Gommerman and Tal have yet to undergo peer review, and some have already suggested that the antibodies they have described may not confer true mucosal immunity.But there's other evidence that a vaccinated person's breakthrough infection may not transmit efficiently to others.Marion Pepper, an immunologist at the University of Washington, says a recentstudy from the Netherlandslooked at how well virus from vaccinated people could infect cells in the lab.Pepper says the answer was not well."If you actually isolate virus from people who are getting a secondary infection after being vaccinated, that virus is less good at infecting cells," Pepper says. "It's not known why. Is it covered with an antibody? Maybe. Has it been hit by some other kind of immune mediators, cytokines, things like that? Maybe. Nobody really knows. But the virus does seem to be less viable coming from a vaccinated person."More studies are emerging that suggest there's something different about the virus coming from a vaccinated person, something that may help prevent transmission.Whatever it is, the University of Colorado's Kedl says it's one more reason that getting vaccinated is a good idea."Because you're going to be even more protected yourself. And you're going to be better off protecting other people."Kedl says that's what you call a win-win situation.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Bill ChappellIn federal lawsuits, parents in Wisconsin are blaming school districts for coronavirus infections, saying they should not have ended mask requirements during a pandemic. Here, a student in Michigan is seen arriving at school in late August.Matthew Hatcher/Getty Imageshide captionIn federal lawsuits, parents in Wisconsin are blaming school districts for coronavirus infections, saying they should not have ended mask requirements during a pandemic. Here, a student in Michigan is seen arriving at school in late August.Parents whose children have been infected with the coronavirus in Wisconsin have an unlikely ally: a brewery and its super PAC.Filing lawsuits in both of Wisconsin's federal court districts, the parents are suing school districts for rescinding mask requirements and floutingother federal and state health guidance. They're backed by the Minocqua Brewing Company of Minocqua, Wis., which sells what it calls "progressive beer" — and whose owner is using itspolitical action committee to help fund the legal fight.One of the lawsuits says that by axing safety protocols, school board officials "threw students into a Covid-19 'snake pit.'"It also accuses a school board of violating "the 14th Amendment that ensures the right to be safe from state created dangers while in school," asmember station WPRreported.Shannon Jensen, the lead plaintiff in a lawsuit against the School District of Waukesha,on the outskirts of Milwaukee, says that her son's elementary school class seems to have experienced an outbreak, with at least four positive cases in a short time frame last month.Jensen's son wears a mask at school even though many other students don't, but he still became infected. In a signed declaration to the court, Jensen said a student who sits next to her son came to class on two consecutive days despite having COVID-19 symptoms and not wearing a mask."The child went to the school nurse on Friday morning, was sent back to class and again visited the nurse around lunch time," Jensen said in the court filing. "At that time, he was running a fever and was sent home from school but had been in contact with my son all week."On Sunday night, Jensen said, her son tested positive. It wasn't until Monday, she said, that the school informed her of a positive case in her son's class.The lawsuit says the infection and illness Jensen's son experienced was directly caused by the school district's "reckless refusal to implement reasonable Covid-19 mitigation measures."Jensen also says her family's life was severely disrupted as they tried to quarantine three children, follow what school lessons they could gather and  repeatedly test other family members for coronavirus infection.The experience was markedly different from the 2020-2021 school year, Jensen says, when the school district had widespread mitigation measures in place, such as a mandatory mask rule and physical dividers in classrooms. She attributes the change to the school board's decision in May to cut many safety measures, including the mask requirement.Jensen's suit was filed last week in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin; a second suit was filed on Monday against the Fall Creek School District in the federal court for the Western District of Wisconsin.The plaintiffs are seeking class action status, accusing school districts and board members across Wisconsin of failing in their responsibility to protect children.The federal lawsuits seek an injunction requiring the school districts to follow state and federal health guidelines and to pay plaintiffs' court costs and legal fees.The Minocqua Brewing Company and its super PAC are helping out with those costs."We raised over $50K last week to pay lawyers, infectious disease experts, and epidemiologists to work around the clock to prepare this case," the company's owner, Kirk Bangstad, saidon his Facebook page.Bangstad says he initially founded the super PAC as a reaction to discussions about governments' efforts to bolster businesses during the pandemic. But its mission became more pointedly political after the Jan. 6 insurrection, and it recently became involved in theincreasingly heated disputesover school policies and the recent spike in coronavirus cases."Wisconsin communities have exploded with the Delta variant because many school districts have dropped all forms of Covid mitigation that were in place last year," Bangstad wrote in a blog post, "due to the shrieking hordes of Tucker Carlson-watching zombies separated from their cerebrums and driven only by their lizard brains."The brewery sends 5% of its profits to the super PAC, whose motto is "Dark money meant for good."The lawsuits are a new front in the battles over child safety and school policies that are playing out in Wisconsin and around the United States. In a number of cases, school board officials who back federal health protocols are facing recall efforts.The company's super PAC also takes donations online. Bangstad says it uses the money to fund the legal fight against school boards and to campaign against Republicans such as Sen. Ron Johnson and Rep. Tom Tiffany and state lawmaker Rep. Rob Swearingen.Bangstad has a very personal interest in one of those efforts: Last November, he lost his bid to unseat Swearingen. The Democratic candidategot some 14,000 votes, compared with nearly 25,000 for Swearingen.An earlier version of this story mistakenly described Tom Tiffany as a Wisconsin state senator. He is a U.S. representative.An earlier version of this story mistakenly described Tom Tiffany as a Wisconsin state senator. He is a U.S. representative.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

During a news conference that he attended remotely, Irvingtold one reporterthat he wanted "to keep that stuff private," adding that he would "handle it the right way with my team and go forward together with a plan."Irving couldreportedlylose about $380,000 per home game while he's on the roster as ineligible.The Nets had hoped that Irving would change his mind about vaccination in time to head off just such a dilemma that would keep him from playing, butESPN reportsthat in recent days, "the franchise's collective patience will be increasingly tested the longer that Irving stops short of committing to join the team on a full-time basis.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Scott NeumanA mask-clad U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson departs from No. 10 Downing St. in London in March.Hollie Adams/Bloomberg via Getty Imageshide captionA mask-clad U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson departs from No. 10 Downing St. in London in March.The U.K.'s initial response to the coronavirus pandemic ranks among the worst public health failures in the country's history, causing "many thousands" of avoidable deaths, a new report says.In the first weeks, as the virus began spreading in the U.K., the government chose not to restrict mass gatherings — a radical departure from the lockdowns that China quickly put in place. It was slower to impose widespread lockdowns than the U.S. and many other countries.Instead, in the U.K., a "fatalism" about the ability to control the virus set in among government officials and scientific advisers, who sought to "manage, but not suppress, infection," said the new report, which is called"Coronavirus: lessons learned to date.""This amounted in practice to accepting that herd immunity by infection was the inevitable outcome," it said, adding, "It would, however, be an overstatement to say that the Government and its advisers were promoting the acquisition of covid-19 to accelerate herd immunity in the population."By default, though, the government's approach allowed the virus to spread in the population in hopes that the natural immune response generated by those exposed to the coronavirus would help tamp down the pandemic.Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who latertested positive for the coronavirus, initially allowed schools, restaurants, sports venues, movie theaters and pubs to remain open. His decision was backed by an advisory group of U.K. scientists.The report, produced by the U.K.'s Health and Social Care Committee and the Science and Technology Committee, said the decision not to lock down and social distance sooner amounts to "one of the most important public health failures the United Kingdom has ever experienced."It blamed the policy failure on "groupthink" between politicians and scientists  that led to a resistance to adopting the measures as in other countries.The "rapid discharge of people from hospitals into care homes without adequate testing or rigorous isolation" was also a key issue in the early response to the pandemic, the report said.Although the U.K. shifted its approach as deaths mounted, the damage had already been done, according to the report."[It] was a mistake to allow patients to be transferred to care homes without the rigour shown in places like Germany and Hong Kong. This, combined with untested staff bringing infection into homes from the community, led to many thousands of deaths which could have been avoided," it said.The report also pointed to an abrupt halt in community testing in the early phase of the pandemic, which left authorities without the information they needed to tackle the surge in infections. "A country with a world-class expertise in data analysis should not have faced the biggest health crisis in a hundred years with virtually no data to analyse."Despite the significant criticisms contained in the more than 140-page report, it offered some praise for the government's handling of vaccine development and distribution, saying London's investment in vaccines, starting with the UK Vaccine Network in 2016, "clearly paid off."The rollout of vaccines was "not plain sailing," the report acknowledged, pointing to problems in obtaining enough doses from drugmakers."Yet the Government and the [National Health Service] succeeded in maintaining public confidence in the leadership and operation of the vaccination programme, partly through a transparent communications programme," it said.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

A panel of advisers to the Food and Drug Administration will meet Thursday to review Moderna's booster shot.The Food and Drug Administration released briefing documents Tuesday on booster shots for the Moderna and Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccines ahead of a two-day public meeting of advisers to the agency that starts Thursday.Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine booster is half the dose of the initial shots used in its two-shot vaccination — 50 micrograms of mRNA versus 100 micrograms.Thecompany's analysissays data on the immune response and side effects seen in people studied supports the use of a booster in people ages 18 and older six months or longer after initial immunization. The company cited an increase in breakthrough infections seen from the delta variant as a justification for a booster.However, in light of theFDA's action on Pfizer-BioNTech's booster application last month, Moderna is seeking authorization of a booster dose of its vaccine on the same terms. That means the booster would be for people 65 and older, those ages 18 to 64 and at high risk for severe COVID-19 and people 18 to 64 whose institutional or occupational exposure put them at risk for severe COVID-19.In August the agency authorized a third, full-strength Moderna dose for people with compromised immune systems.AJohnson & Johnson analysisconcludes that a booster given to people 18 and older six months or longer after initial vaccination with a single shot has a favorable risk-benefit balance. For people at higher risk of COVID-19, the company said its data supports a booster as soon as two months after the first.The documents included a separateJohnson & Johnson analysis of potential side effectsfrom its vaccine. As of the end of August, the company said about 33.5 million doses of the one-shot vaccine had been administered worldwide, including 14.3 million in the U.S.The company analysis noted a range of rare reports that include acute liver failure, autoimmune disorders, blood clots, heart inflammation and a decline in platelets in the blood. None appeared to be so common as to present a significant safety problem. J&J pledged to continue to monitor the experience of people who receive the vaccine.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
The Associated PressThis image provided by Merck & Co. shows their new antiviral medication. The drugmaker has said its experimental pill for people sick with COVID-19 reduced hospitalizations and deaths.Merck & Co./APhide captionThis image provided by Merck & Co. shows their new antiviral medication. The drugmaker has said its experimental pill for people sick with COVID-19 reduced hospitalizations and deaths.WASHINGTON — Drugmaker Merck asked U.S. regulators Monday to authorize its pill against COVID-19 in what would add an entirely new and easy-to-use weapon to the world's arsenal against the pandemic.If cleared by the Food and Drug Administration — a decision that could come in a matter of weeks — it would be the first pill shown to treat COVID-19. All other FDA-backed treatments against the disease require an IV or injection.An antiviral pill that people could take at home to reduce their symptoms and speed recovery could prove groundbreaking, easing the crushing caseload on U.S. hospitals and helping to curb outbreaks in poorer countries with weak health care systems. It would also bolster the two-pronged approach to the pandemic: treatment, by way of medication, and prevention, primarily through vaccinations.The FDA will scrutinize company data on the safety and effectiveness of the drug, molnupiravir, before rendering a decision.Merck and its partner Ridgeback Biotherapeutic said they specifically asked the agency to grant emergency use for adults with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 who are at risk for severe disease or hospitalization. That is roughly the way COVID-19 infusion drugs are used."The value here is that it's a pill so you don't have to deal with the infusion centers and all the factors around that," said Dr. Nicholas Kartsonis, a senior vice president with Merck's infectious disease unit. "I think it's a very powerful tool to add to the toolbox."The company reported earlier this month that the pill cut hospitalizations and deaths by half among patients with early symptoms of COVID-19. The results were so strong that independent medical experts monitoring the trial recommended stopping it early.Side effects were similar between patients who got the drug and those in a testing group who received a dummy pill. But Merck has not publicly detailed the types of problems reported, which will be a key part of the FDA's review.U.S. officials continue to push vaccinations as the best way to protect against COVID-19. But with some 68 million eligible Americans still unwilling to get the shots, effective drugs will be critical to controlling future waves of infection.Since the beginning of the pandemic, health experts have stressed the need for a convenient pill. The goal is for something similar to Tamiflu, the 20-year-old flu medication that shortens the illness by a day or two and blunts the severity of symptoms like fever, cough and stuffy nose.Three FDA-authorized antibody drugs have proved highly effective at reducing COVID-19 deaths, but they are expensive, hard to produce and require specialty equipment and health professionals to deliver.Assuming FDA authorization, the U.S. government has agreed to buy enough of the pills to treat 1.7 million people, at a price of roughly $700 for each course of treatment. That's less than half the price of the antibody drugs purchased by the U.S. government — over $2,000 per infusion — but still more expensive than many antiviral pills for other conditions.Merck's Kartsonis said in an interview that the $700 figure does not represent the final price for the medication."We set that price before we had any data, so that's just one contract," Kartsonis said. "Obviously we're going to be responsible about this and make this drug as accessible to as many people around the world as we can."Kenilworth, New Jersey-based Merck has said it is in purchase talks with governments around the world and will use a sliding price scale based on each country's economic means. Also, the company has signed licensing deals with several Indian generic drugmakers to produce low-cost versions of the drug for lower-income countries.Several other companies, including Pfizer and Roche, are studying similar drugs and are expected to report results in the coming weeks and months. AstraZeneca is also seeking FDA authorization for a long-acting antibody drug intended to provide months of protection for patients who have immune-system disorders and do not adequately respond to vaccination.Eventually some experts predict various COVID-19 therapies will be prescribed in combination to better protect against the worst effects of the virus.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

New Zealand's doctors and teachers are among those who must soon be fully vaccinated against the coronavirus to continue working in their professions, the government announced Monday.Dean Purcell/APhide captionA Health worker administers vaccinations at a pop-up drive-in clinic Monday, Oct. 11, 2021, in Auckland, New Zealand. New Zealand's doctors and teachers are among those who must soon be fully vaccinated against the coronavirus to continue working in their professions, the government announced Monday.WELLINGTON, New Zealand — Most of New Zealand's health care workers and teachers will soon be legally required to get vaccinated against the coronavirus, the government announced Monday.A new mandate compels doctors, pharmacists, community nurses and many other health care workers to be fully vaccinated by December. Teachers and other education workers must be fully vaccinated by January.COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins said many in those professions had already gotten their jabs but they couldn't leave anything to chance, especially because those people deal with sick patients and young children who aren't yet approved for the vaccine themselves."It's not an easy decision, but we need the people who work with vulnerable communities who haven't yet been vaccinated to take this extra step," Hipkins said.New Zealand already requires many people who work at the border to be vaccinated.The announcement comes as New Zealand battles an outbreak of the highly transmissible delta variant in its largest city, Auckland.The initial responses from groups representing affected workers were in favor of the mandate."Given the speed at which delta is spreading throughout our country, this is a bold, but necessary call to make," said Dr. Samantha Murton, president of The Royal New Zealand College of General Practitioners.Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said Monday that Auckland would stay in lockdown for at least another week, while the nearby regions of Waikato and Northland could come out of lockdown on Thursday if no significant spread of the virus was found in those places.Auckland has been in lockdown for nearly two months, since the outbreak was discovered. Thirty-five new local cases were found in the city on Monday, bringing the total number of cases in the outbreak to a little over 1,600.Last week Ardern acknowledged that the virus was in New Zealand to stay, and it wouldn't be completely wiped out by measures including lockdowns and contact tracing, which had succeeded in eliminating previous outbreaks.Ardern has been urging people to get vaccinated as a step toward the nation reopening.This coming weekend, the government is planning a "Super Saturday" vaccination drive that it likens to an Election Day, when vaccination centers will be open throughout the day and into the evening.About 68% of New Zealanders have had at least one dose of the vaccine and 47% are fully vaccinated. Among those aged 12 and over, the figures rise to 82% and 57% respectively.The government on Monday also announced an advanced purchase agreement for 60,000 courses of an experimental new pill by drug maker Merck, pending approval by New Zealand regulators.The pill, molnupiravir, would be the first shown to treat COVID-19, if it's approved by regulators including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

She also didn't expect to be carrying the honor two years later and through the pandemic.The COVID-19 pandemic hit Black, brown andIndigenouscommunities at a deadlier rate through 2020. When President of the Navajo Nation Jonathan Nez declared the pandemic a public health crisis in thetribe, Parrish's role as Miss Navajo Nation changed."Nobody really tells you how to be Miss Navajo in general, let alone how to be Miss Navajo Nation during the pandemic," Parrish told NPR's Lulu Garcia-Navarro."We really took a hands-on approach and I'm very fortunate the president included me in the conversations and also in the food distributions to be on the front lines with him," Parrish said.They were so focused on the work, Parrish says, they lost track of time and organizing the pageant in 2020 was not a focus. She ended up staying Miss Navajo Nation for another year."We were so focused on our work that we didn't realize it was August, and usually the pageant takes place in September, so with little time, we didn't prioritize the pageant. And we really wanted to prioritize the health and wellbeing of our people," Parrish said.Parrish says the work involved food and water distribution, visiting parts of the Navajo Nation that had no running water and providing hand sanitizer. She had to make personal sacrifices, too, choosing to self-isolate away from her family in 2020 while doing the work so she wouldn't put them at risk of contracting the virus."Being isolated, that definitely takes a huge toll on your mental health and just your wellbeing in general but we really stuck together as a team. We're very fortunate to have kept each other safe," she said.The Miss Navajo Nation pageant is different than what most people might think of when they consider a pageant event. The event takes place half in English and half in the Navajo language, and contestants have to show a deep knowledge of Navajo culture and heritage.One of the rounds of the pageant includes showing how to properly slaughter a sheep and prepare the cuts of meat in the traditional way, to prove Miss Navajo Nation's ability to take care of her family and her people, and pass on the traditions to the next generation.Now, Parrish, agraduateof Arizona State University and a former staffer in the state's senate, is able to pass on the title. The 2021 pageant took place in September this year and Niagara Rockbridge was named the new Miss Navajo Nation."I am excited for her," Parrish said. "I am very excited to see how she will help our people."Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
The Associated PressLos Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva says he will not enforce the county's vaccine mandate in his agency.Jae C. Hong/APhide captionLos Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva says he will not enforce the county's vaccine mandate in his agency.LOS ANGELES — The Los Angeles County sheriff says he will not enforce the county's vaccine mandate in his agency.Sheriff Alex Villanueva, who oversees the largest sheriff's department in the country with roughly 18,000 employees, said Thursday in a Facebook Live event that he does not plan to carry out the county's mandate, under which Los Angeles County employees had to be fully vaccinated by Oct. 1.The mandate was issued by executive order in August and allows only for religious and medical exemptions. Villanueva said his employees are willing to be terminated rather than get vaccinated."I don't want to be in a position to lose 5, 10% of my workforce overnight on a vaccine mandate," the sheriff said.More than 26,000 people have died of the coronavirus in Los Angeles County, which is the nation's most populous county.Of the county's roughly 10 million residents, 78% have received at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose and 69% are fully vaccinated, according to public health officials.Health officials said the county has reported 14 deaths a day, on average, even though deaths and hospitalization figures have plunged by some 50% since late August.Villanueva's announcement came a day after the city of Los Angeles approved one of the nation's strictest vaccine mandates — a sweeping measure that requires the shots for everyone entering bars, restaurants, nail salons, gyms or even a Lakers game.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

If you have a question you'd like us to consider for a future post, email us atgoatsandsoda@npr.orgwith the subject line: "Weekly Coronavirus Questions." See an archive of our FAQshere.A friend's invitation to fly in for a visit at their vacation cabin came with a request for a COVID-19 precaution that seemed ... not very helpful.Michael Fox/EyeEm /Getty Imageshide captionA friend's invitation to fly in for a visit at their vacation cabin came with a request for a COVID-19 precaution that seemed ... not very helpful.My friends invited me to spend a weekend at their cabin. I'm vaccinated. So are my friends – who are demanding that I get a rapid COVID-19 test right after traveling to see if I got infected during the flight. But a test wouldn't address that concern so isn't it ... a ridiculous request?Well, clearly it's not ridiculous to your friends, who want to be assured that you did not get infected while traveling.But here's the thing.You don't get sneezed or coughed or breathed on by an infectious person and then instantly register "RED ALERT" on a COVID-19 test. If you are exposed to someone who's infectious and you do pick up enough viral particles to develop a breakthrough infection, it would take three to five days before your personal viral load would be high enough to register "positive."That's what the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says.So a test right after you've flown doesn't provide any real assurance.And it's a waste of valuable resources. You'd be using up a test for no reason."I would tell your friends, 'I'm going to follow the CDC guidelines,' " saysDr. Jill Weatherhead, assistant professor of adult and pediatric infectious diseases at Baylor College of Medicine, "because being tested after a flight isn't going to answer the question you're trying to answer:" Did you pick up a breakthrough infection during your travels?Maybe you could persuade them to give up their test demand by highlighting  the steps you took to mitigate risk in the days before you got on the plane as well as during the trip, saysCharlotte Baker, assistant professor of epidemiology at Virginia Tech. So you might say something like: "I was tested a few days before I left, I knew I wasn't positive for COVID, I wore a double mask or a mask on the flight, I washed my hands, I carried sanitizer. I did all these things that are scientifically based." Following such protocols will offer a better degree of protection for your friends than sharing the results of a right-off-the-plane test, says Baker.If your friend really wants assurances that you didn't pick up an infection during travel, you could stay away from their cabin for three days and then take the COVID-19 test.But you also have to ask yourself: Are my friends really going to listen to me? We all know people you can't reason with. So just as it's hard to talk someone into, say, getting a vaccine or putting on a mask if they are dead set against it, it can be difficult to convince someone that their extra-cautious frame of mind is not really backed up by scientific evidence.If that's the case, you'll have to make a decision based on your inner compass. The answer might be that you'll end up taking a rain check on that weekend in the cabin. Or you could decide to humor your friend's request."I think the main message now as we move through this pandemic is everyone's going to have different levels of risk tolerance," notes Weatherhead. "If you communicate and respect what makes people feel comfortable, the easier it will be to navigate through the pandemic and still have that relationship."So maybe you'll end up taking that test to appease your friends, says Baker: "For the sake of the relationship, I would do it if it was that important and I couldn't use data to convince them otherwise."Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Will StoneRegistered nurse Christie Lindog works at the cardiovascular intensive care unit at Providence Cedars-Sinai Tarzana Medical Center in Tarzana, Calif., on Sept. 2.Apu Gomes/AFP via Getty Imageshide captionRegistered nurse Christie Lindog works at the cardiovascular intensive care unit at Providence Cedars-Sinai Tarzana Medical Center in Tarzana, Calif., on Sept. 2.With a second pandemic winter approaching, there are promising signs that the worst of the delta surge has run its course, but in America's hospitals — already short-staffed and backlogged from the summer torrent of COVID-19 — the relief may be only short-lived.Many are staring down a tough stretch of colder months with the threat of a potentially bad influenza season, an influx of patients trying to catch up on delayed care and a depleted workforce that has had little time — if any — to regroup from this latest wave of coronavirus infections."It's like a perfect storm, right? High volume, high acuity and low staff," says emergency physicianGregg Miller, who's chief medical officer for the health care staffing group Vituity. "Winters are already tough for hospitals and emergency departments."And while some of the leading COVID-19 modelingsuggests the U.S. will be spared another major onslaughtof the coronavirus during the holiday season, recent history has shown hospitals that nothing is predictable with this virus."We need to be prepared for always having some individuals who are infected with COVID in our hospitals and needing acute care," saysDr. Amy Williams, executive dean of the Mayo Clinic Practice.The much-feared "twindemic" of influenza and the coronavirus didn't hit last winter, likely in part because of the social distancing and masking that people undertook in response to the coronavirus.But some experts fear that last year's remarkably mild flu season has now set the stage for a big rebound in the coming months, because fewer people have built up immunity."It could be really bad, and it could be really bad at a time when there's still quite a bit of COVID-19 filling up our hospitals," saysDr. Mark Roberts, director of thePublic Health Dynamics Laboratoryat the University of Pittsburgh.In past flu seasons — not including last year — there were on average about 300,000 to 400,000 hospitalizations for influenza, he says.Two recent studiesfrom Roberts' and his colleagues suggest this season could bring an additional 100,000 to 400,000 flu hospitalizations. Research on previous flu seasons hasestimated there were between 18,000 and 96,000intensive care unit admissions associated with the flu, depending on the season.Flu season is hard to predict, and it's possible these worst-case scenarios will not happen, but that depends on the strain of flu that predominates and people's behaviors."There's quite a checkerboard of COVID mitigation in the United States, and so how much influenza you see will be dependent upon that, as well as how many people get vaccinated against the flu," Roberts says.Plus, COVID-19 isn't entirely going away, even with optimistic predictions.Modeling from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and others show there could be a steady decline in cases on a national level, but there may very well be enough coronavirus to fuel regional outbreaks and keep some hospitals busy."I still expect to see some surges," saysStephen Kissler, a research fellow at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. "I don't think we are totally out of the woods yet."The combination of even a mild to moderate flu season and what remains of this current wave of COVID-19 is likely to strain precious ICU resources, saysDr. Greg Martin, president of the Society of Critical Care Medicine."The delta surge is not going away as quickly as anyone would like, and that long tail is creating a lot of uncertainty and anxiety," he says.Patients already tend to show up to the hospital sicker during the wintertime, and this could be especially true this year, after the massive disruptions in health care access created by COVID-19, leading to a backlog of delayed care.Some patients have been forced to put off much needed surgeries and inpatient treatments, while others have stopped routine doctors appointments that might have caught some growing health problem before it became too severe, says Vituity's Miller."We're already dealing with a baseline of sicker patients, so what's going to happen when it's colder and people slip and fall? Or they're a little bit more likely to get a mild cold that tips over their heart failure?" he says.Many hospitals have tried to avoid halting much needed medical procedures for other kinds of patients during this latest wave of COVID-19, but that has not necessarily been possible in some hard-hit states.In Washington state, MultiCare Health System was already "very, very full before the delta wave kicked in and really surged our cases," saysDr. Michael Myint, physician executive for population health with MultiCare.Myint expects MultiCare will be working through deferred care for a while, given the demands of COVID-19 in its hospitals right now."We're still at the levels that we were at the peak of last wintertime and last respiratory season," he says.After surge after grueling surge of COVID-19 patients, the health care workforce is flagging, with many parts of the U.S. simultaneously experiencing major staffing shortages."The crisis that we have unfolding in this country right now is the inability to provide the right staff for the patients that need care," saysDr. Omar Lateef, CEO of Rush University Medical Center in Chicago.This loss in health care providers is particularly pronounced in nursing, and many hospitals are competing fiercely for the same limited pool of travel nurses to fill the gaps. There are also concerns that COVID-19 vaccine mandates could further erode the workforce, although Lateef says that isn't the driver of their staffing problems."It's truly related to supply and demand," he says. "And the difference now from years past is we'll have this increase in patient volume nationally, around the same time that we have a decrease in health care providers."It's not just a numbers problem either. Hospitals are "seeing an exodus" of their most seasoned health care workers, saysDr. Thomas McGinn, executive vice president for physician enterprise at CommonSpirit Health, a nationwide health care system."Instead of retiring in one or two years, they're retiring now," he says. "A lot of those experienced people teach the younger folks as they come in, so there's this tension of losing senior people and losing those that would be training on the job."And this couldn't come at a worse time. With all the compounding factors, health care workers are dreading the oncoming rush of patients this winter."People are tired in health care, and there's a burnout that we haven't seen in this country [before]," says Lateef. "That combined with the increased volumes we expect in winter sets the stage for even more burnout in the future and even more staffing issues."Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Bill ChappellColorado's UCHealth hospital system is requiring any prospective organ transplant recipients to get the COVID-19 vaccine. Here, a man receives a COVID-19 vaccine in Thornton, Colo., earlier this year.Michael Ciaglo/Getty Imageshide captionColorado's UCHealth hospital system is requiring any prospective organ transplant recipients to get the COVID-19 vaccine. Here, a man receives a COVID-19 vaccine in Thornton, Colo., earlier this year.A large hospital system in Colorado says people on its organ transplant wait list won't be offered an organ if they refuse to get the COVID-19 vaccine, citing the "significant risk the virus poses to transplant recipients."UCHealth, which operates 12 hospitals from its headquarters in Aurora, Colo., says it has long been standard practice to require many organ recipients or donors to get vaccines such as hepatitis B or the MMR shot.The hospital system added COVID-19 to its vaccine list a few weeks ago. But the change is drawing notice now, after Colorado state Rep. Tim Geitner publicized the case of a woman who says the hospital told her has no chance of receiving a kidney transplant because she isn't vaccinated."UCHealth denies life saving treatment," the Republican lawmakersaid via Twitter.In the letter Geitner posted, the woman was informed that she would remain on the hospital's wait list for a kidney — but that her status would be deemed "inactive" until she gets the vaccine, according to an image of a letter addressed from UCHealth that Geitner shared online..@jaredpolis.@GovofCOIs this how “selfish bastards” and “bad actors” are to be treated in, “A Colorado For All”?https://t.co/3opspFJglhA hospital official told NPR that they are unable to share or confirm information about specific patients. But in response to a flurry of questions about its policy,UCHealth saidthat people who undergo an organ transplant are routinely subject to a number of health requirements, from a drug regimen to prevent rejection to abstaining from tobacco or alcohol — and getting vaccines.The "vast majority" of its patients who are hospitalized with COVID-19 are unvaccinated, according toUCHealth. And it says organ recipients are at increased risk for the worst outcomes from the coronavirus."Various studies show that between 20% and 30% of unvaccinated transplant recipients who contract COVID-19 have died," the hospital system said in an update posted late Wednesday.The vaccine requirements and other measures "are in place to ensure patients have the best chances of recovery and good outcomes, UCHealth said.In late summer, UCHealth adopted a vaccine requirement for all of the employees at its hospitals and other facilities."An unvaccinated person is about 50 times more likely to be hospitalized for COVID-19 than a vaccinated person, and nearly 300 times more likely to die if infected," the hospitalsaid at the time.Organ transplant wait lists are highly competitive, with hopeful recipients greatly outnumbering the available kidneys, livers and other organs that become available each year."On any given day there are around 75,000 people on the active waiting list for organs,"according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, "but only around 8,000 deceased organ donors each year, with each providing on average 3.5 organs. Living donors provide on average only around 6,000 organs per year."This year, both theAmerican Liver Foundationand theNational Kidney Foundationhave called for wide access to the COVID-19 vaccine and booster shots for organ recipients, citing their immunocompromised health status.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Joanne SilbernerAdela WuNeurosurgeonMichael Haglund, founder of Duke Global Neurosurgery and Neurology, has one word to describe the initial effect of COVID-19 on his organization's global health initiatives."Terrible."Since 2007, his group has performed hundreds of life-saving neurosurgical procedures. They've repaired traumatic brain injuries and removed brain tumors. They've sent neurosurgeons, nurses, bioengineers and physical therapists to train local health care providers. When they started, Uganda had five neurosurgeons for 30 million people; now it has 14, in addition to lots of newly trained nurses and others.But no members of the Duke group have set foot in Africa since the pandemic began. "This was just so frustrating," Haglund says.The 25-year-old Himalayan Cataract Project was on track to do 75,000 eye surgeries in Ghana, Ethiopia and Nepal in what turned out to be the first year of the pandemic. They did only about a third of those planned cases, says Dr. Matt Oliva, an ophthalmologist with the project. "My worst fear is that by helping someone see, we unexpectedly expose them to COVID. We had to hit the pause button and reconsider our strategy."For many decades, medical missions have flown doctors and nurses from wealthy countries into poorer nations, set up temporary clinics, treated as many patients as they could in a week or two, then flown their staff back home. These visits may have helped those who were in the front of the line for care — butdon't helpthose who can't be seen during a limited visit or need follow-up care — until and unless the mission returns.In recent years, there's been a shift in focus in medical missions – a recognition that training in-country medical staff to do surgeries or provide routine medical care is a better path than parachuting in for a round of procedures.Since the pandemic began, both types of programs have been kayoed by travel restrictions, lockdowns and the influx of COVID patients.Judith Lasker, a medical sociologist who has been studying medical missions for decades, estimates that 90% of the fly-in missions shut down. But many of the training missions have found ways to work around COVID's travel restrictions.And while the training missions were figuring out work-arounds, the pandemic provided time for debate over the effectiveness of medical missions, which pleases Lasker: "It's shifted to what's the right thing to do and who should be doing it and how should they be doing it, and not taking for granted that sending a bunch of people somewhere that's poor is somehow automatically going to benefit those folks.""The pandemic has provided the opportunity to rethink," saysDr. Lawrence Loh, an adjunct professor at Dalla Lana School of Public Health at the University of Toronto.To get a sense of the new reality for medical missions, we talked to representatives of a half-dozen organizations whose volunteers provide surgical and medical care while training local health professionals.All have found ways to stay involved. The initial "terrible" situation for the Duke group, for example, has turned out not so badly. Duke's pre-COVID missions were based on "twinning"-- pairing up its doctors, nurses and biomedical engineers with local health professionals. And those local people have been able to carry on the work even though most in-person missions have stopped.For example, Duke doctors are working on research papers with counterparts in Uganda, bioengineers there are checking with their North Carolina counterparts for help in fixing equipment, Haglund zooms every other week with the neurosurgery trainees, and his group has just sent neurosurgical equipment to a recently remodeled hospital in Kampala.Dr. Michael Haglund stands in an operating theater at Mulago National Referral Hospital in Kampala, Uganda, in 2014. Haglund, the founder of Duke Global Neurosurgery and Neurology, had been traveling to Uganda to perform brain surgeries twice a year since 2007 – until the pandemic hit.Rebecca Vassie/APhide captionDr. Michael Haglund stands in an operating theater at Mulago National Referral Hospital in Kampala, Uganda, in 2014. Haglund, the founder of Duke Global Neurosurgery and Neurology, had been traveling to Uganda to perform brain surgeries twice a year since 2007 – until the pandemic hit.Like Duke,Bridge to Health, which forms partnerships with local communities in poor countries to provide medical care and training, stopped sending people out. It took a deep dive into digital training."Sometimes it takes a pandemic to force you to do things differently," says William Cherniak, co-founder of the organization. Bridge to Health had planned to send portable ultrasound machines each about the size of an electric razor and 3 or 4 trainers to Yemen in 2020 to teach doctors there how to use ultrasound for diagnosis. When COVID made the trip a no-go, the organization started to work on a solution they've already beta-tested in Kenya.It's basically a digital version of teamwork that pairs the camera on an i-Pad or i-Phone with the image from the portable ultrasound probe. Trainers in the U.S. and Canada can see the trainee's hands, the patient and the ultrasound image in real time.Getting the ultrasound probes into Yemen without sending people along with them took some time. The shipping logistics finally came together last week, and the devices should be in Yemen soon."It's really opened our eyes to go, oh, wow, there is really fantastic technology available to us and we can do things in a more innovative way," Cherniak says. "We're in Toronto, but we're essentially there in Yemen too."With the money saved from eliminating travel, Bridge to Health is considering supporting more on-the-ground staffers, purchasing more ultrasound devices and paying to treat patients in Yemen with medical conditions identified by the ultrasound images. That might mean covering the cost of antibiotics for pneumonia or surgery for abdominal trauma.Some of the training missions managed to continue some travel during the pandemic. That meant taking new precautions. The Himalayan Cataract Project maintained physical distancing in clinics and used PPE to make sure health workers from the U.S. weren't unintentionally exposing patients in other countries to SARS-CoV-2.All the revamping and travel restrictions cut into how much they could do on these pandemic trips. "Instead of seeing 200 people a day we'd see 30 people," says ophthalmologist Matt Oliva. "We'd work out of one room instead of several, with one surgeon doing surgery."Still, the organization made progress toward its ultimate goal of creating local eye surgery programs that can work without Western doctors present. With less travel on their 2020 schedule, project staff had time to develop online training modules that could reach more doctors and nurses. The cataract project used to send African doctors to Nepal for training under the guidance of visiting Western experts; now the African doctors could stay home and still learn.And there's one benefit that has nothing to do with health-care but everything to do with earth care, notes Judith Lasker – fewer plane trips. She got together with the Catholic Health Association a few years ago and determined that half the budget of the medical missions they surveyed went to airfare. Now, she says, "We're not polluting the air as much. These trips are hugely carbon footprint heavy."ReSurge, one of the first medical missions to focus on training local health workers rather than having Westerners do it all, worked in 17 countries in the year before COVID, then cancelled all training and surgical trips in spring of 2020. That could have meant calling a halt to training on reconstructive surgeries like cleft palate repair and burn repair for surgeons in Latin America, Africa, and south Asia."We realized that to remain relevant, we would need to really ramp up our virtual training," says Jeff Whisenant, president and CEO ofReSurge. And they did. Where 636 young surgeons attended lectures and virtual training in the year before COVID, 2,803 surgeons did so in the first year of the pandemic. And instead of working in 17 countries, ReSurge was able to work in 31.When ReSurge first started with virtual lectures in Uganda, they saw a really big uptake. "And then we saw it decline," says Whisenant. It turned out the surgical trainees couldn't afford the data costs for web access on their own, so ReSurge tried a new approach – funding the local hospital to create an e-learning center for not only reconstructive surgeons but for other doctors as well. "It's been a blessing in disguise for us," says Whisenant. Overall, he says, the tragic pandemic had not a silver lining but a golden one — more care being provided by local providers.But there's also a longing for a return to in-person training among in-country medical staff. "None of our visiting educators could come to Nepal since January 2020," says Shankar Rai, a reconstructive surgeon in Nepal who wasinstrumentalin getting medical missions to focus on educating local health professionals and who works with ReSurge. "We have tried to compensate with webinars and other virtual educational activities. Still, we miss the opportunity to socially interact, care for patients together and learn so many things from visiting educators." In Nepal, reconstructive surgery stopped with the onset of the pandemic. With vaccines trickling in, some surgeries are starting up again, and Rai is eagerly awaiting the return of visiting educators.Joanne Silberner is a freelance journalist and former health policy correspondent for NPR.

Jaclyn DiazA patient shows her COVID-19 vaccine card at the Clínica Monseñor Oscar A. Romero in the Pico-Union district of Los Angeles on July 26.Damian Dovarganes/APhide captionA patient shows her COVID-19 vaccine card at the Clínica Monseñor Oscar A. Romero in the Pico-Union district of Los Angeles on July 26.By next month Los Angeles will require residents and visitors to show proof of a COVID-19 vaccine in order to eat, drink, or shop in indoor establishments across the city.Under this mandate, eligible patrons will need to show proof of a COVID-19 vaccination to enter restaurants, bars, coffee shops, stores, gyms, spas or salons. People attending large, outdoor events will also need to show evidence of either vaccination or proof of a negative COVID-19 test to attend the event.Proof of vaccination includes a vaccination card issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a photo of both sides of the card, documentation from a health care provider, or a digital record of vaccination issued by California, another state or country.The City Council passed the new law on Wednesday and Mayor Eric Garcetti approved the sweeping ordinance later that day. It's set to take effect sometime in November.This mandate adds on to the recently-passed statewide rule requiring all elementary through high school students to get coronavirus vaccines.The city-wide mandate passed despite some residents writing to the City Council in opposition to the rule, arguing the policy was unconstitutional and unenforceable. Copies of letters from the publicwere sharedon the L.A. City Council agenda for Wednesday's meeting.But city officials argued an earlier surge in coronavirus cases across the country thanks to the delta variant drove Los Angeles to this decision. Though nationwide, cases of the virusare trending downward.This new mandate passed Wednesday also goes further than the Los Angeles County Department of Health'sorder, issued last month, requiring customers atoutdoor events of 10,000 or more to show proof of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test. That rule also applied to indoor bars, wineries, breweries, and nightclubs.Garcetti signed the ordinance Wednesday saying he hopes it will force more residents to get vaccinated.Los Angeles reportsthat 78% of residents 12 and older have received at least one dose of the coronavirus vaccine. At least 92% of residents older than 65 have received one dose."Vaccinating more Angelenos is our only way out of this pandemic, and we must do everything in our power to keep pushing those numbers up,"Garcetti said."These new rules will encourage more people to get the shot, and make businesses safer for workers and customers — so that we can save more lives, better protect the vulnerable, and make our communities even safer as we fight this pandemic."In this Wednesday, July 7, 2021, file photo, patrons enjoy tropical cocktails in the tiny interior of the Tiki-Ti bar as it reopens on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles.Damian Dovarganes/APhide captionIn this Wednesday, July 7, 2021, file photo, patrons enjoy tropical cocktails in the tiny interior of the Tiki-Ti bar as it reopens on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles.Under the ordinance, customers who are not vaccinated can use an establishment's outdoor space. They can only enter the indoor portion of a store or restaurant for brief moments, either to use the bathroom, to pick up an order, or to pay, while wearing a well-fitting mask.A business found in violation of this mandate could face punishment that includes a warning or notice for a first violation, a $1,000 fine for a second violation, a $2,000 fine for a third, and a $5,000 fine for a fourth violation.Those who cannot be vaccinated for religious or health reasons must show proof of a negative COVID-19 test and proof of an exemption.Los Angeles follows a trend emerging in other major cities, including West Hollywood, San Francisco and New York City who have similar rules requiring showing a proof of a vaccine to enter some indoor establishments.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Andrea HsuMargaret Applegate (in yellow scarf), a United Airlines customer service agent, is accompanied by Lori Augustine, vice president of United's San Francisco hub, as Applegate gets a COVID-19 vaccine in September ahead of United's mandated deadline.Sam Almira/United Airlineshide captionMargaret Applegate (in yellow scarf), a United Airlines customer service agent, is accompanied by Lori Augustine, vice president of United's San Francisco hub, as Applegate gets a COVID-19 vaccine in September ahead of United's mandated deadline.In the quest to get more Americans vaccinated, one thing is becoming increasingly clear: Vaccine mandates work.Nowhere is that more apparent than atUnited Airlines.  On Aug. 6, United became the first U.S. airline to tell its workers to get vaccinated against COVID-19 if they wanted to keep their jobs.The company says 99.5% of United employees have been vaccinated, not counting the roughly 2,000 who have applied for religious or medical exemptions. Elsewhere, other employers also report success with mandates. Tyson Foods, New York City schools, major hospital systems in Maine and the NBA are among those with vaccination rates topping 90%.Taking the shot isn't an easy decision for many people. One of them was Margaret Applegate, a San Francisco-based customer service agent with United for 29 years. She was proud of how United had handled the pandemic up until then — the lengths the airline had gone to for keeping workers and customers safe, even partnering with Clorox on cleaning and disinfecting.Now she no longer felt so proud.Applegate, who is 57, had not gotten vaccinated. Like many people, she was scared. She'd heard from friends in the U.S. and abroad about bad reactions to the shots, and she worried that the vaccine could exacerbate her heart condition.She was also uneasy about how quickly the COVID-19 vaccines had been developed and authorized for use."I thought that was a little bit too rushed. It just felt too rushed," she says.Still, she wrestled with what to do. She was troubled by the death of a co-worker from COVID-19 and the diminished health of another co-worker who had been hospitalized with the virus and survived. She recognized the vaccine mandate as her company's final push to keep employees safe.With United's deadline approaching, Applegate finally settled on the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. She reasoned that the technology behind the J&J shot was more established than themRNA technologybehind the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.Even then, she remained highly conflicted. She spoke with her doctor and her children, one of whom is a cancer researcher. The day before her appointment, Applegate connected with Lori Augustine, a former customer service agent who rose through the ranks to become a vice president at United. Though they are roughly the same age, Applegate thinks of her as motherly, someone whose opinion she trusts.Sensing Applegate's lingering hesitation about the vaccine, Augustine did what a mother would do. She offered to take her to the appointment."When she offered, I could not really say no," says Applegate. "She genuinely cared."After being denied a religious exemption, Golden State Warriors forward Andrew Wiggins reluctantly went for the Johnson & Johnson vaccine."The only options [were] to get vaccinated or not play in the NBA," Wiggins said at a news conference, sharing that it was a tough decision. "Hopefully it works out in the long run, and in 10 years I'm still healthy."Even in places where there is not yet a vaccine mandate, just the anticipation of one seems to be having an effect.Andre Bastian works as a federal contractor, guarding a prominent government building in Washington, D.C. After a slow start and a lot of opposition, almost all of his co-workers have now been vaccinated. UnderPresident Biden's executive order, federal contractors must be vaccinated by Dec. 8."What it really comes down to is money," says Bastian, a former Marine, noting that private security pays well, leading even the most skeptical to "just bite the bullet and do it."At United, Margaret Applegate is relieved to have the decision behind her. She wasn't ready to quit her job. She is loved by customers, who give her rave reviews. She, in turn, loves the challenge."I was planning on still going strong, maybe even at 70 if I can," she says.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Rhitu ChatterjeeCarmel WrothCOVID-19 survivors gather in New York and place stickers representing lost relatives on a wall in remembrance of those who have died during the pandemic.Stefan Jeremiah/APhide captionCOVID-19 survivors gather in New York and place stickers representing lost relatives on a wall in remembrance of those who have died during the pandemic.Of all the sad statistics the U.S. has dealt with this past year and a half, here is a particularly difficult one: A new study estimates that more than 140,000 children in the U.S. have lost a parent or a grandparent caregiver to COVID-19. The majority of these children come from racial and ethnic minority groups."This means that for every four COVID-19 deaths, one child was left behind without a mother, father and/or a grandparent who provided for that child's home needs and nurture — needs such as love, security and daily care," says Susan Hillis, an epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and lead author of the new study.The study, which was published Thursday in the journalPediatrics, estimated the number of losses from April 1, 2020, through the end of June 2021 at 140,000. And that number has risen in the past three months: Hillis estimates it is around 175,000 today."This number will continue to grow as long as our pandemic deaths increase," Hillis says.Once a child loses their parent or primary caregiver, Hillis says, the tragedy is something they live with for "the entire duration of their childhoods."It's a situation that calls for urgent action, Hillis notes. These children need "understanding, help, support," she says. And it's important "to ensure that they have a safe and loving family to continue to support their needs and nurture."And, just as COVID-19 has killed more people in communities of color, children in these communities are the most impacted by the loss of parents and primary caregivers."Sixty-five percent of all children experiencing COVID-associated orphanhood or death of their primary caregiver are of racial and ethnic minority," says Hillis. "That is such an extreme disparity."The study defines orphanhood as the death of one or both parents. The study also tracked the loss of caregiving grandparents.And if you look more closely at individual groups, American Indian and Alaska Native children were 4.5 times more likely to have lost a primary caregiver compared with white children. Black children were 2.4 times more likely and Hispanic children almost twice as likely.Losing a parent or caregiver in childhood is a significant trauma. The study notes that this type of adverse childhood experience "may result in profound long-term impact on health and well-being for children.""Adverse childhood experiences are associated with increased risks of every major cause of death in adulthood," says Hillis.And in the short term, the impact of losing a parent or primary caregiver can lead to mental health crises for kids, including increased suicide risk, Hillis says, and "increased exposure to sexual, physical and emotional violence and exploitation."And in terms of life outcomes, a body of earlier research shows that losing a parent can put kids at a higher risk of economic, food and housing insecurity.This adds a new layer of risk to kids in communities of color, which are already disadvantaged.These communities experience inequities in access to health care, housing, education, and other factors that contribute to children's well-being, saysDr. Warren Ng, a psychiatrist at Columbia University who primarily works with kids in communities of color."The numbers don't tell the full stories," he says. "The full story is really in the lives and the affected future of these children and adolescents and their families."Mental health care providers who are seeing the mental health effects of the pandemic on kids say these losses are particularly traumatic. Ng says even grieving has been difficult for them — many didn't even get to see their parents or grandparents in the hospital, or say goodbye."One of the things that's unique about the pandemic is that it's also not only deprived us of a loved one, but it's also deprived us of our opportunities that come together, so that families can heal, [and] support one another in order to really get through the most difficult times of life," he says.The study authors also call for policy action. "What we are proposing is that there be serious consideration to adding a fourth pillar to our COVID response, and that fourth pillar would be called care for children," says Hillis.This would involve finding resources and coming up with systems for "finding the children, assessing how they are doing and linking them to appropriate care," she says, and strengthening economic support for families who care for the children.The data highlighted here, especially the racial and ethnic inequities, "really does demand an urgent and effective response for all children," Hillis says.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

That said, we expect that those points of view be expressed respectfully, in a manner consistent with our values, and in line with our internal policies. We are having direct conversations with Sage and those conversations will remain private."ESPN also shared a statement from Steele. "I know my recent comments created controversy for the company, and I apologize," she said. "We are in the midst of an extremely challenging time that impacts all of us, and it's more critical than ever that we communicate constructively and thoughtfully."A week ago on the podcast, Steeletold Cutler, a former NFL quarterback, that she had just gotten her COVID-19 vaccine after being required to by Disney, which owns ESPN."I respect everyone's decision. I really do. But to mandate it is sick, and it's scary to me in many ways," she said. "But I have a job, a job that I love and, frankly, a job that I need."The COVID-19 vaccine has been shown to greatly reduce the risk of hospitalization and death in people who are infected with the coronavirus.On the subject of race, Steelesaidshe thought it was "fascinating" that Obama identified himself as Black on the U.S. census "considering his Black dad was nowhere to be found but his white mom and grandma raised him."Steele alsosaidyoung female journalists bear some responsibility for preventing any harassment they may face in the male-dominated world of professional sports."When you dress like that, I'm not saying you deserve the gross comments, but you know what you're doing when you're putting that outfit on, too," she said.In atweet, Cutler linked to a story about Steele getting pulled off the air after appearing on his podcast and called it "ridiculous."Carron J. Phillips, a senior writer for Deadspin,noted a contrastbetween how ESPN treated Steele and how it responded when former anchor Jemele Hill called then-President Donald Trump a "white supremacist," characterizing the company's responses as "sooooooo different."After Hill's comments drew scrutiny in 2017, the sports networkissued a statementsaying: "The comments on Twitter from Jemele Hill regarding the President do not represent the position of ESPN. We have addressed this with Jemele and she recognizes her actions were inappropriate."Hill, ina tweetthis week, said Steele's remarks on Obama and up-and-coming female sports reporters amounted to "clown behavior."Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
The Associated PressArizona Gov. Doug Ducey has signed into law several measures that restricted the power of local governments to enact COVID-19 protection measures.Ross D. Franklin/APhide captionArizona Gov. Doug Ducey has signed into law several measures that restricted the power of local governments to enact COVID-19 protection measures.The Biden administration on Tuesday ordered Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey to stop using the state's federal pandemic funding on a pair of new education grants that can only be directed to schools without mask mandates.In a letter to Ducey, the Treasury Department said the grant programs are "not a permissible use" of the federal funding. It's the latest attempt by the Biden administration to push back against Republican governors who have opposed mask mandates and otherwise sought to use federal pandemic funding to advance their own agendas.Ducey, a Republican, created the grant programs in August to put pressure on school districts that have defied the state's ban on mask mandates.He launched a $163 million grant program using federal funding he controls, but he made it available only to schools without mask mandates. He also established a $10 million program that offers vouchers to families at public schools that require masks or that tell students to isolate or quarantine due to COVID-19 exposure.In the letter, Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo said the conditions "undermine evidence-based efforts to stop the spread of COVID-19." He asked the state to explain how it will "remediate" the problem within 30 days.C.J. Karamargin, a spokesperson for Ducey, said it's "baffling" why anyone would oppose the grant programs."Following the challenges during the 2020 school year, everyone's primary focus should be equipping families with the resources to get their kids caught up. That's exactly what this program does — giving families in need the opportunity to access educational resources like tutoring, child care, transportation and more," Karamargin said in a statement.He said the governor's office is reviewing the letter and plans to respond.Arizona is one of at least eight states that have laws or executive orders banning mask requirements in public schools.The Education Department in August opened civil rights investigations into five Republican-led states that forbid mask mandates in schools, saying such actions may violate the rights of students with disabilities. The agency later added Florida to the list of states under investigation. It said it was watching several other states in case it needed to take action, including in Arizona.The Education Department separately promised to repay school districts who have state funding withheld for defying bans on mask requirements. Last month, the agency sent nearly $150,000 to the School Board of Alachua County in Florida after the state withheld pay for school board members because the district requires masks.Education advocates have filed a lawsuit over Arizona's ban and several other state laws that restrict the power of local governments and school districts to impose COVID-19 requirements.Those policies conflict with guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which recommends universal mask wearing for students and teachers in the classroom. The CDC issued the guidance in light of the rapid spread of the highly contagious delta variant of COVID-19.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

COVID-19 protocols around the country have divided parents and school staff, in some cases leading to violence and intimidation.U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland has directed federal authorities to meet with local law enforcement over the next month to discuss strategies for addressing the increase in "harassment, intimidation and threats of violence against school board members, teachers and workers" in public schools across the country.Theone-page memorandumdirects the FBI and U.S. Attorney's Offices to meet with federal, state, Tribal, territorial and local law enforcement leaders over the next 30 days in the hopes of opening up channels of communication for threat reporting, assessment and response."While spirited debate about policy matters is protected under our Constitution, that protection does not extend to threats of violence or efforts to intimidate individuals based on their views," Garland wrote, characterizing threats against public servants as both illegal and "counter to our nation's core values."The directive comes amidst a surge in confrontations at local school board meetings over topics like masking, vaccine requirements and how race is taught in schools, and a request for federal help.In asix-page letter to President Bidenlast week, the National School Boards Association detailed instances of threats and acts of violence (mostly related to mask mandates) at school board meetings in states including California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Michigan, New Jersey, Wisconsin, Wyoming, Texas and Virginia.It says such conduct — whether at local meetings or threats sent through mail and social media — endangers students and educators and disrupts school district operations, and notes the growing threat of "extremist hate organizations showing up at school board meetings.""As these acts of malice, violence, and threats against public school officials have increased, the classification of these heinous actions could be the equivalent to a form of domestic terrorism and hate crimes," the school boards association wrote, asking for federal help investigating and preventing them.Garland's memorandum also says that the Justice Department will announce more efforts aimed at addressing the rise in "criminal conduct directed toward school personnel" in the days ahead. Those are expected to include:"The Department takes these incidents seriously and is committed to using its authority and resources to discourage these threats, identify them when they occur, and prosecute them when appropriate," he said.This story originally published intheMorning Editionlive blog.An earlier version of this story named an organization that has promoted school board rallies and protests in California, but says it was not involved in the specific incidents in other states mentioned in the story.

The Associated PressJohnson & Johnson has asked U.S. regulators to allow booster shots of its COVID-19 vaccine.David Zalubowski/APhide captionJohnson & Johnson has asked U.S. regulators to allow booster shots of its COVID-19 vaccine.WASHINGTON — Johnson & Johnson asked the Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday to allow extra shots of its COVID-19 vaccine as the U.S. government moves toward expanding its booster campaign to millions more vaccinated Americans.J&J said it filed a request with the FDA to authorize boosters for people 18 and older who previously received the company's one-shot vaccine. While the company said it submitted data on several different booster intervals, ranging from two to six months, it did not formally recommend one to regulators.Last month, the FDA authorizedbooster shots of Pfizer's vaccinefor older Americans and other groups with heightened vulnerability to COVID-19. It's part of a sweeping effort by the Biden administration to shore up protection amid the delta variant and potential waning vaccine immunity.Government advisers backed the extra Pfizer shots, but they also worried about creating confusion for tens of millions of other Americans who received the Moderna and J&J shots. U.S. officials don't recommend mixing and matching different vaccine brands.The FDA is convening its outside panel of advisers next week to review booster data from both J&J andModerna. It's the first step in a review process that also includes sign-off from the leadership of both the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. If both agencies give the go-ahead, Americans could begin getting J&J and Moderna boosters later this month.J&J previously released data suggesting its vaccine remains highly effective against COVID-19 at least five months after vaccination, demonstrating 81% effectiveness against hospitalizations in the U.S.But company research shows a booster dose at either two or six months revved up immunity even further. Data released last month showed giving a booster at two months provided 94% protection against moderate-to-severe COVID-19 infection. The company has not yet released clinical data on a six-month booster shot.FDA's advisers will review studies from the company and other researchers next Friday and vote on whether to recommend boosters.The timing of the J&J filing was unusual given that the FDA had already scheduled its meeting on the company's data. Companies normally submit their requests well in advance of meeting announcements. A J&J executive said the company has been working with FDA on the review."Both J&J and FDA have a sense of urgency because it's COVID and we want good data out there converted into action as soon as possible," said Dr. Mathai Mammen, head of research for J&J's Janssen unit.The vaccine from the New Brunswick, New Jersey, company was considered an important tool in fighting the pandemic because it requires only one shot. But its rollout was hurt by a series of troubles, including manufacturing problems at a Baltimore factory that forced J&J to import millions of doses from overseas.Additionally, regulators have added warnings of several rare side effects to the shot, including a blood clot disorder and a neurological reaction called Guillain-Barré syndrome. In both cases, regulators decided the benefits of the shot still outweighed those uncommon risks.Rival drugmakers Pfizer and Moderna have provided the vast majority of U.S. COVID-19 vaccines. More than 170 million Americans have been fully vaccinated with the companies' two-dose shots while less than 15 million Americans got the J&J shot.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
The Associated PressNinety-five percent of New York City's roughly 148,000 public school staffers had received at least one vaccine dose as of Monday morning, according to the mayor.John Minchillo/APhide captionNinety-five percent of New York City's roughly 148,000 public school staffers had received at least one vaccine dose as of Monday morning, according to the mayor.NEW YORK — A COVID-19 vaccination requirement for teachers and other staff members took effect in New York City's sprawling public school system Monday in a key test of the employeevaccination mandatesnow being rolled out across the country.Mayor Bill de Blasio said 95% of the city's roughly 148,000 public school staffers had received at least one vaccine dose as of Monday morning, including 96% of teachers and 99% of principals.Some 43,000 employees have gotten the shots since the mandate was announced Aug. 23, de Blasio said."Our parents need to know their kids will be safe," the mayor said. "They entrust us with their children. That's what this mandate is all about. Every adult in our schools is now vaccinated, and that's going to be the rule going forward."U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona joined de Blasio's virtual briefing and hailed the vaccine mandate."You're doing it right," Cardona said. "Students need to be in the classroom. They need to be safe and we need to make sure we're doing everything possible to let our staff get vaccinated and make sure that our schools are as safe as possible."The mayor had warned that unvaccinated school employees would be placed on unpaid leave and not be allowed to work this week. The city planned to bring in substitutes where needed.Schools Chancellor Meisha Ross Porter said she did not know exactly how many employees had declined the shots and been put on leave.Implementing the mandate smoothly will be a test for de Blasio, a Democrat who boasted of the city's record of keeping school buildings open during most of the last school year when other districts went to all-remote instruction. New York City is not offering a remote option this year.Students arrive at PS811 in New York on Monday, the first day all staff members are supposed to be vaccinated.Richard Drew/APhide captionStudents arrive at PS811 in New York on Monday, the first day all staff members are supposed to be vaccinated.The vaccination mandate in the nation's largest school system does not include a test-out option, but does allow for medical and religious exemptions. It was supposed to go into effect last week but was delayed when a federal appeals court granted a temporary injunction. An appeals panel reversed that decision three days later.The 96% teacher vaccination rate cited by the mayor was slightly different from the 97% figure provided earlier Monday by United Federation of Teachers head Michael Mulgrew.Vaccination rates rose in every school job category after the mandate was announced. District Council 37 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, which represents some 20,000 city Department of Education employees, said 93% of those workers had provided proof of at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose as of Sunday, up from 68% at the beginning of September.Under a deal worked out with the city, unvaccinated District Council 37 members who want to apply for a medical or religious exemption have until 5 p.m. Tuesday to do so, union officials said in a news release.New York City's million-plus-student public school system is one of the first in the nation to require inoculations for all staff members. A similar mandate is set to go into effect in Los Angeles on Oct. 15.A group of teachers and other school employees who had sued over New York's school vaccine mandate  asked the U.S. Supreme Court  on Thursday for an emergency injunction blocking its implementation. The request was denied Friday.Many students and parents support the vaccine mandate as the best way to keep schools open during the pandemic."It's safer for our kids," said Joyce Ramirez, 28, who was picking her three children up from a Bronx elementary school last week.Ramirez said she hopes the requirement will lessen the chances of teachers contracting the virus and prompting classroom or school shutdowns.Cody Miller, a 15-year-old sophomore at a high school in Manhattan, said teachers should all be vaccinated. "I think they should," said the teen, who got vaccinated himself as soon as the Pfizer shot was approved for people 12 and up. "It's so many kids, it's a big environment, you know?"But Mally Diroche, another Bronx parent, had mixed feelings. "I kind of feel like that's a decision they should be able to make on their own," said the mom of three boys between 3 and 12. Diroche, 29, said she feels that masks and other precautions can check the spread of the virus within schools.Some educators have reservations about the mandate but are complying.Maurice Jones, 46, a support staff member at a Manhattan middle school, said he got vaccinated months ago but sympathizes with co-workers who have not gotten the shots. "If they've got to get tested more they've got to get tested more," Jones said. "I don't think they should lose their job."Roxanne Rizzi, who teaches technology at an elementary school in Queens, waited until Friday to get her first coronavirus vaccine shot."I had to do it for the finances of my family," she said.Rizzi, 55, had resisted the vaccine because she contracted COVID-19 in November and believed natural immunity would protect her. She said she would continue to protest the mandate.According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, people should get vaccinated even if they have already been infected by the virus. The agency says COVID-19 vaccines offer better protection than natural immunity and help prevent getting infected again.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Katja RidderbuschFromPamela Winn, a registered nurse by training, was pregnant when incarcerated in 2008. After a miscarriage, she was put into solitary confinement for what she was told was medical observation. That eight months in solitary scarred her for life, she says.Katja Ridderbusch/KHNhide captionPamela Winn, a registered nurse by training, was pregnant when incarcerated in 2008. After a miscarriage, she was put into solitary confinement for what she was told was medical observation. That eight months in solitary scarred her for life, she says.Sometimes, Pamela Winn isn't sure how to connect with people, even those she loves, like her 9-month-old granddaughter. When the baby is in her arms, "I sit there quietly, and I don't know what to say. What to do," she said, her eyes filling with tears. "My socializing skills are just not there anymore."On days like these, Winn, who lives south of Atlanta, is haunted by the memory of her 6-by-9-foot prison cell, where she spent eight months in solitary confinement more than 10 years ago. She said she now feels "safest when I'm by myself."This story was produced by Georgia Health News and KHN.It's a common paradox of solitary confinement, saidCraig Haney, a professor of social psychology at the University of California-Santa Cruz. Instead of craving the company of others after release from social isolation, many former prisoners want just the opposite."Solitary forces prisoners to live in a world without people," he said. "And they adapt to it."Research has long shown that solitary confinement — isolating prisoners for weeks, months, years and sometimes decades — has devastating effects on their physical and mental health. Once released, either to the general prison population or to the outside world, they can face a suite of problems, likeheart damageanddepression. They're often hypersensitive to light, sound, smell or touch.Like Winn, they may struggle to read social cues. People, Haney said, "become a source of anxiety rather than support."And the coronavirus pandemic may have made the situation worse.Before the pandemic, the estimated number of people in solitary confinement in the U.S. ranged from 50,000 to 80,000 on any given day, though many advocacy organizations believe counts are underestimated. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states that medical isolation — the separation of people with a contagious disease from the rest of the population — should not hinge on solitary confinement. Yet, at the height of the pandemic last year, up to 300,000 incarcerated individuals were in solitary, according to estimates fromSolitary Watch and The Marshall Project, non-profits focused on criminal justice."Jails and prisons, like many organizations, acted in fear," saidTammie Gregg, deputy director of the American Civil Liberties Union's National Prison Project. "They thought the way to keep people from infecting each other was to simply put them in solitary."Solitary confinement can serve many goals, from punishment to protection. And it is called many things — protective custody, restrictive or secure housing, administrative or disciplinary segregation, or simply "the Hole.""The conditions are essentially the same: It's the extreme deprivation of any meaningful social contact," Haney said.In the Mandela Rules, named for South African leader Nelson Mandela, who was imprisoned for 27 years, theUnited Nationsassociates solitary confinement lasting longer than 15 consecutive days with a form of torture. More than half of all U.S. states have introduced or passed some type of legislation restricting or regulating the use of solitary confinement – like limiting the practice for juveniles, for example. But it is still widely used in American jails and prisons. And in the majority of states, prisoners can still be in solitary for more than 15 days.Inmates in solitary typically live in a small cell for up to 23 hours a day. They have little sensory stimulation, like sunlight. Access to reading materials, educational programming and personal property is limited or nonexistent. Prisoners may get one hour in a recreational yard, an equally isolated area typically enclosed or surrounded by concrete walls, with a secured high window that opens for fresh air.An analysisby researchers with the University of Colorado and Human Rights Watchsuggests that more than half of all prison suicides occur in solitary confinement. Astudy conducted by the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygienefound that the rate of self-harm among those in solitary is 10 times that of the general prison population.The isolation can be particularly destabilizing for people with preexisting mental health conditions, often exacerbating underlying issues that cause people to end up behind bars in the first place. "It's a downward spiral," said Haney.AFlorida State Universitystudy published earlier this year found that prisoners with mental illness, especially bipolar disorder, severe depression and schizophrenia, were up to 170% more likely to be placed in solitary for extended periods. In many prisons, experts worry, mental health treatment is nonexistent, making matters worse.But even among people without a history of mental health problems, it may be impossible to predict who is susceptible to the harmful effects of solitary confinement, including suicide.Pamela Winn, a registered nurse by training, was incarcerated in 2008 and later convicted to a 6½-year federal prison sentence forhealth care fraud. As the now-53-year-old African American woman with red-colored curls sits in her ranch home, her mind goes back to what she said was the darkest time of her life.When she entered a federal holding facility south of Atlanta, she said, she was a healthy woman. She was also six weeks pregnant. One day, she fell as she was trying to step into a van while shackled. Three months later, she miscarried and was put into solitary confinement for what she was told was medical observation.After a few months, she was transferred to a municipal prison, where she was placed into solitary again, this time for protection. For a total of eight months, at two facilities, she lived in tiny cells, with iron beds, thin foam mattresses, and metal sinks with toilets attached."No window. No mirror. No clock. No concept of time," she said. She was allowed to leave her cell for one hour a day. She could shower three times a week if staffers were available.In the beginning, she replayed the traumatic memory of the night she lost her baby. Eventually, she joined in when other inmates screamed in their cells."I acted out. I threw stuff against the wall. I was angry," she said. Before she went to sleep, she prayed for God to take her. "But I kept waking up."In Haney's experience, prisoners who develop a strategy to withstand the excruciating loop of idleness have a better chance of surviving. Some individuals force themselves to maintain a routine, to act as if there is a coherence in their life, "even though there isn't," he said.Winn said she developed a strategy: She would start the day by praying. She would picture what her two teenage sons were doing. She would do sit-ups and mental exercises, like remembering street names. After solitary, she served most of her sentence in a federal prison in Florida and was released in 2013.Her time in solitary scarred her for life, she said. To this day, she has high blood pressure. Paranoia is a constant companion; her house is surrounded by a solid wooden fence with a security gate, and she has two Rottweilers. Small spaces make her anxious, and she can't tolerate strangers getting too close, such as in a coffee shop line.While she struggles to connect with her granddaughter, Winn keeps a journal, hoping that one day, when her granddaughter is old enough, she'll understand."She can read it and learn about everything that's in my heart and on my mind ... if I'm still here, if I'm not here, wherever I am."Both Haney and Gregg said jails and prisons have alternatives to long-term, extreme isolation. Mentally ill prisoners who engage in disciplinary infractions should be put into a treatment-oriented unit, said Haney.For someone who acts violently, solitary confinement should be only a short-term solution aimed at acutely de-escalating the outburst, said Gregg. Afterward, those individuals should go to units that provide programming to address the root cause of their behavior. This may mean separation from the general prison population, but less time in total isolation.A similar model could also apply to prisoners in solitary for their own safety, such as former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who is serving a 22½-year-prison sentence for the murder of George Floyd. They could be placed in smaller units with individuals who have undergone a thorough risk assessment, and with access to education and training, Haney said.Prisoner advocates are hopeful that solitary confinement in the U.S. will eventually be a concept of the past. In April, New York became the first state to codify the U.N.'s Mandela Rules that ban solitary after 15 consecutive days, when theHalt Solitary Confinement Actwas signed into law. The legislation will take effect next April.After Winn's release from prison, she foundedRestoreHER, a nonprofit that advocates to end the mass incarceration of women of color, and pregnant people, in particular. She also helped enact laws in Georgia and North Carolina that bar the shackling of pregnant women."What I'm doing now gives me some redemption," she said.This story was produced byGeorgia Health NewsandKHN(Kaiser Health News).KHNis a national newsroom and an editorially independent program ofKFF(Kaiser Family Foundation).Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Laurel WamsleyBrittany Watson, Katherine Hart, Dawn Carlisle and Amanda Mackanos protest vaccine mandates outside Winchester Medical Center in August in Winchester, Va.The Washington Post via Getty Imageshide captionBrittany Watson, Katherine Hart, Dawn Carlisle and Amanda Mackanos protest vaccine mandates outside Winchester Medical Center in August in Winchester, Va.Brittany Watson worked as a nurse at the hospital in Winchester, Va. — until her employer, Valley Health,announcedthat all staff must get vaccinated.Watson says there are a couple reasons why she hasn't gotten the jab. One is that she got COVID-19 in November, so she figures she has some natural immunity. And she's also skeptical ofall the carrotsthat have been dangled – things like college scholarships, hunting rifles, fishing licenses — to urge West Virginians like herself to get vaccinated."I possibly would have gotten it if it wasn't such a push to get it," Watson says. "And then they mandate it. Now you're telling me what to do. I've worked 18 months in the pandemic, and now I'm not allowed to work there if I don't have a vaccine."Whether an employer grants a religious exemption to a vaccination requirement is generally based on a judgment of the employee's sincerely held religious belief — and whether the accommodation poses an undue hardship on the employer, or would present a direct threat to health and safety of others.Watsonorganized a picket lineoutside the Winchester Medical Center in protest of Valley Health's mandate. She also applied for a religious exemption, signed by her pastor."My explanation was that 'Human life is sacred. The Bible tells you that your body is a temple. The vaccine is made from aborted fetuses. The mandate is directly affecting my religious beliefs.' And that's it," she says.The vaccines themselves do not contain any fetal cells. Fetal cell lines were used in the vaccines' development, as they commonly are in developing new pharmaceuticals.Valley Health did approve her religious exemption, but Watson has decided to look for a job elsewhere.Watson's girlfriend, Katherine Hart, also had her religious exemption approved by Valley Health.

They applied for and received religious exemptions.Brittany Watsonhide captionBrittany Watson and Katherine Hart protested their employer's COVID-19 vaccine mandate. They applied for and received religious exemptions."I went back to work and literally nothing has changed. I'm seeing the same patients," Hart says. "I do COVID testing. I see COVID patients every day. I'm wearing my same masks, I'm following the same rules. Literally nothing has changed, which makes me even more suspicious, because if I was that much of a menace to society, you'd think that they would have to change the rules and make me do something differently."Hart and Watson say others they know had their exemption requests rejected.Last month, Valley Health terminated the employment of 72 employees, out of a workforce of more 6,000, due to noncompliance with its vaccine mandate. The health care system says more than 95% of its employees are now vaccinated, with 5% exempt for religious or medical reasons.No major religion has come out in opposition to the COVID-19 vaccines.Jehovah's Witnesses,Christian Scientists, and theCatholic Churchhave all issued statements saying that their religion does not prohibit members from receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. The Pope has declared getting vaccinated"an act of love.""Employers are being flooded with these requests [for religious exemptions], and are having to evaluate them in large numbers," says Alana Genderson, an attorney specializing in labor and employment law at the firm Morgan, Lewis & Bockius.Because employers are wary of wading into assessing questions of religion and personal belief, Genderson says "employers feel more comfortable judging undue hardship, and whether there is an accommodation where the person would not be a direct threat to others."A person receives the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine at a clinic at St. Patrick's Catholic Church in Los Angeles in April.Mario Tama/Getty Imageshide captionA person receives the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine at a clinic at St. Patrick's Catholic Church in Los Angeles in April.The idea of evaluating sincerity is particularly thorny."Sincerity is like, what's true in your heart. There's no way to judge that as religious or not, or as sincere or not," says Kira Ganga Kieffer, a doctoral candidate in religious studies at Boston University, where she's writing a book on vaccine skepticism in America.But there is a legal basis for employers to assess sincerely held religious belief.Genderson says that according to federal guidance and previous court decisions, employers may consider several factors when assessing the sincerity of a religious belief."Those factors can include whether the employee's behavior is inconsistent with the professed belief; the accommodation constitutes a desirable benefit likely to be sought for secular reasons; the timing of the request renders it suspect; or the employer has an objective reason to believe the accommodation is not sought for religious reasons," she explains.Employers can request additional information from the employee, such as asking whether theytake other medicinesthat also used fetal cells in their development, like Tylenol or Motrin.When Kieffer started her research, she was originally looking atmeasles outbreaksin places where parents had opted out from school-required vaccinations.In those cases, she says, "it was political, yes, but it was not a red versus blue issue. It wasn't a Republican versus Democrat issue. You had people on both sides with the measles."But the politicization of this virus has changed that."The folks that are most angry now or most objecting now are kind of a new cohort, I'd say, that is much more traditionally politically motivated," Kieffer says.The stakes couldn't be higher. As religious exemptions are now beingsought in droves, their use raises concerns that they pose a serious public health risk.Participants bow their heads in prayer during a COVID-19 prayer vigil on the National Mall honoring and mourning those who have died due to the coronavirus pandemic in Washington, D.C., in July.Win McNamee/Getty Imageshide captionParticipants bow their heads in prayer during a COVID-19 prayer vigil on the National Mall honoring and mourning those who have died due to the coronavirus pandemic in Washington, D.C., in July."We believe firmly that religious freedom should not be a license to cause harm to others," says Rachel Laser, CEO at Americans United for Separation of Church and State. She says it's problematic to have public safety hinge on difficult-to-assess questions of individual religious sincerity."What that created is a situation where we are actually seeing herd immunity being put at risk, and public safety being put at risk, where religious exemptions are sort of so voluminously being claimed," Laser says."What we need to do is is draw a line where religious freedom would put lives at risk and where it would cause harm to others," she says. "So we don't even have to get to that calculation of sincerity.""I actually think a mandate is a blunt instrument at this stage in the game, because it's all so new," says Jason McKnight, lead pastor at Grace Fellowship Church in Kinston, N.C.He himself is vaccinated, and church members have asked for his guidance in how to approach the mandates."Obviously, scripture does not talk about vaccines," he says, laughing. "So how do we seek principles and use wisdom to apply rightly, how someone needs to live in their consciences, but not in a way that's silly?"He says vaccine concerns are something that some people are struggling with, among many other questions in their lives. He hears concerns that the vaccines are still too new, too untested — but people might not have a choice about getting vaccinated, if they want to keep their jobs.McKnight says if a member asked for his signature on a religious exemption, he thinks he would sign it."Part of my role is to stand with the underdog. That's what Jesus did," he says. "And that's why we're working at trying to figure out how to get Afghan refugees here, why we're working at trying to help migrant workers. Nurses that are going to lose their job because they're just not ready to be vaccinated just seems a little harsh right now in a civilized world."Sharon Lofquist raises her arms to religious music as demonstrators gathered to protest vaccine mandates outside the Michigan State Capitol in Lansing in August.Emily Elconin/Getty Imageshide captionSharon Lofquist raises her arms to religious music as demonstrators gathered to protest vaccine mandates outside the Michigan State Capitol in Lansing in August.Randall Balmer was raised in the evangelical church, and is now a professor of religion at Dartmouth and an Episcopal priest.He suspects much of the opposition to the vaccines is politically motivated."I have to believe that something else is at work here, that there is some sort of underlying ideology that says, I don't know: 'We don't want the Biden administration to succeed in vanquishing this public health crisis,' " he says."There's certainly no theological basis for this sort of opposition."And he thinks many churches could be doing a greater public service in the pandemic, noting that they enjoy tax-exempt status.Balmer says "a reasonable approach to this dire public health crisis would be for these churches, these religious organizations to say, 'Listen, we understand that the public has been subsidizing us for a long time. In return, we think we have a civic obligation, and we're willing to assume that obligation not only to be vaccinating ourselves, but to vaccinate others.' ""And I even dare say that this might be what Jesus would do in a similar situation," he says.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

President Biden has ordered 80 million workers in the U.S. to get vaccinated or undergo regular testing.Mario Tama/Getty Imageshide captionCOVID-19 vaccines are offered at Lake Charles Memorial Hospital on August 10, 2021 in Lake Charles, La. President Biden has ordered 80 million workers in the U.S. to get vaccinated or undergo regular testing.In early September, just before President Bidenordered 80 million workersto get vaccinated or undergo regular testing, a question went viral on the internet."Would y'all report your unvaccinated co-worker(s) for $200K?" asked @RevampedCP on Twitter.Theresponsescame quickly.I would report my coworkers for a bag of Flamin' Hot Cheetos. And not even a party size bag.I'd report them to get out of work five minutes early. I'd report them to get out of work two minutes early.I'd report them for a basket of Shake Shack fries.I'd report them for free.You aint even need to put that K behind $200https://t.co/UM25Eb4Cm5"I was not expecting this," says Arianny Mercedes, the career strategist and public policy student at the University of Virginia who dashed offthe original tweetas she contemplated how far people would be willing to go to get back to "normal."The question became all the more relevant a day after her tweet, when President Biden ordered workers at companies with 100 or more employeesto get vaccinatedor undergo regular testing. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the federal agency overseeing workplace safety, is still working out the details but is expected to issue a rule later this fall.And then comes the challenge of OSHA enforcement, which brings us back to the question about co-workers.Given how small and chronically understaffed the agency is, the idea of snitching on someone in your office is actually not that far from reality.Employee complaints are an important part of enforcement given how few inspectors the government has, says Rich Fairfax, a safety consultant with the National Safety Council who spent 36 years at OSHA, including as head of enforcement.According to OSHA, there are about 1,850 federal and state inspectors covering some 8 million worksites nationwide."So you can do the math," Fairfax says. "They clearly can't go into every one."Animal rights activists protest in front of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration building in Los Angeles, Calif., on March 12, 2021, calling on OSHA to do more to protect slaughterhouse workers from COVID-19.Frederic J. Brown/AFP via Getty Imageshide captionAnimal rights activists protest in front of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration building in Los Angeles, Calif., on March 12, 2021, calling on OSHA to do more to protect slaughterhouse workers from COVID-19.In addition to responding to complaints, Fairfax thinks inspectors will simply add Covid-related tasks to their to do lists — looking to see if a company is keeping vaccination records and running a testing program — when they're already inside the workplace checking up on safety hazards or incidents.Fines for a serious violation can be up to $13,653 per violation, or ten times that for a willful or repeated violation.Still, the press releases that accompany OSHA fines often have a larger impact than the fines themselves, says Jordan Barab, who was acting head of OSHA under President Obama."Employers told us OSHA penalties are... really just a part of doing business," he says. What companies really don't like is having their name in the news in a negative light.Barab believes the vast majority of companies will comply with the federal vaccine rule once it's rolled out, but nevertheless, it's a big moment for OSHA."They've been kind of this small agency that nobody noticed much, and suddenly they're thrown into the spotlight with an extremely controversial policy," he says.It's a policy the government hopes will soon be less controversial, now that more and more workers are getting vaccinated, andvaccine mandates are reporting success.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Yuki NoguchiMatthew Crecelius, a traveling contract nurse who has worked in a dozen hospitals since the pandemic began, says that he can recall numerous instances where health care worker burnout has had a direct impact on patient care.Elaine Cromie for NPRhide captionMatthew Crecelius, a traveling contract nurse who has worked in a dozen hospitals since the pandemic began, says that he can recall numerous instances where health care worker burnout has had a direct impact on patient care.The desperate and frantic pace of hospital work in 2020 in New York, the epicenter of the U.S. pandemic at the time, was more chaotic than anything intensive care nurse Matthew Crecelius had ever seen. "It was like watching a bomb go off in slow motion," he says.He was caring for double the usual number of critically ill patients and navigating hospital halls that looked more like construction zones, with giant fans and plastic tubing blowing a deafening level of extra ventilation. He couldn't hear his patients, or see them through the giant wooden doors of the negative pressure chambers."You shout out to somebody, 'Hey, can you check on my other people?' " he says. " 'I can't even see a monitor; I don't know how they're doing.' "Once, while Crecelius tended to one COVID-19 patient, another ripped off his oxygen mask, triggering a heart attack. Alarms blared. Crecelius rushed to the room, swathing himself in a new gown, to try to revive the man --who died clutching a photo of his daughter. As other nurses rushed in to help, other unattended patients started to crash.Crecelius says he can recall numerous moments like this one, when the crush of work and burnout among health care staff had a direct impact on patient care."That plays out again and again, day by day, at many hospitals, and in my opinion, I think it's getting worse," says Crecelius, a traveling contract nurse who has worked in a dozen hospitals since the pandemic began.Manyhealth care workers surveyedsay they feel burnt out and that is impacting patient care. The prolonged battle against COVID-19 has left many doctors, nurses, medical assistants, respiratory therapists and others on the front lines of care exhausted and overwhelmed, fueling greater levels of burnout that were already high. The advent of vaccines against the coronavirussparked hope of a return to normal — only to be dashed by the latest surge of cases, driven primarily by people who aren't vaccinated.Medicine is a team sport. ... How many clinicians need to be experiencing burnout until we see an effect on quality?Carolyn DewaBurnout is a common term many associate with sheer exhaustion. But theWorld Health Organization says it's also characterizedby greater cynicism and reduced effectiveness at work. It was a huge problem in health care longbefore the pandemic. But now the short staffing and the crushing and unpredictable workload is contributing toepidemic levels of burnout."It's not good for their mental health; it's not good for the work environment. There's increased chance for mistakes, medication errors," saysErnest Grant, a specialist in burn care andpresident of the American Nurses Association. Many fellow nurses he talks to say they're at the end of their rope, which Grant says presents a hazard for any patient needing urgent care right now. "There is no health without nurses," he says.But just how muchburnout affects patient careis very hard to gauge. Multiple studies have linked burnout tolower quality of care. But many of those studies rely mostly on subjective measures, such as patient surveys and self-reporting by nurses and doctors. So drawing a cause-and-effect connection isn't easy.What happened toCarolyn Dewain California illustrates why.After her father was hospitalized in April with cancer, Dewa had a hard time reaching his physicians. Pandemic-related restrictions at the hospital limited when family could visit, and the sheer volume of patients left the staff no time to call the family with updates or to explain treatments.At one point, doctors treating Dewa's father halted his anti-stroke medication, thinking his throat might be too constricted to swallow the pills. "No one asked me," says Dewa, who had been taking care of her father before the hospitalization and knew he was still able to eat and swallow.As doctors rushed between patients, she says, they were relying more than usual on numbers and charts to make decisions about how to care for each person.Carolyn Dewa, a professor of psychiatry at University of California, Davis, studies how burnout affects medical care. She believes she lost her father, who passed away in April, to the effects of health care worker burnout.Salgu Wissmath for NPRhide captionCarolyn Dewa, a professor of psychiatry at University of California, Davis, studies how burnout affects medical care. She believes she lost her father, who passed away in April, to the effects of health care worker burnout.A short time later, her father died of a stroke.A painful irony that only adds to Dewa's grief: As part of her work as a professor at the University of California, Davis, shestudies the effect of burnout on medical care. "I know what good care is supposed to look like," she says.Speaking from a personal perspective, Dewa adds, she does feel burnout cost months of her beloved dad's life. But she also recognizes the extreme stress his caregivers were under. It would be very hard, she says, to pinpoint objectively how much that burnout contributed to his death."Medicine is a team sport," Dewa says. "So can you attribute it to one clinician? How many clinicians need to be experiencing burnout until we see an effect on quality?"Clearly, one huge problem is ashrinking fieldof seasoned professionals in medicine. Since the pandemic's start, some health care workers haveretired earlyand many say they'reconsidering leaving the field.Crecelius, the traveling ICU nurse, says that increasing reliance on less-experienced health workers can hurt patients. At the small Michigan hospital where he works now, he recently discovered that a nurse on a previous shift had inadvertently put a heart attack patient on the wrong medication.It's really a game of dominoes where the doctor is just emotionally devastated because they can't fix it.Lindsay Moore-Ostby"She's a newer nurse and doesn't know this is completely inappropriate. Had someone more experienced been here, we would have been able to catch that," he says.Crecelius says he used to think of such incidents as teaching moments. These days, he has no time or energy to mentor. He just complains to his colleagues, about his colleagues.That shortness of time, staff and fuses can fuel still more burnout.Nurses tend to a COVID-19 patient in an intensive care unit in 2020. Burnout was already an issue among health care workers prior to the pandemic, but short staffing and unpredictable workloads have exacerbated the problem.John Moore/Getty Imageshide captionNurses tend to a COVID-19 patient in an intensive care unit in 2020. Burnout was already an issue among health care workers prior to the pandemic, but short staffing and unpredictable workloads have exacerbated the problem.Recently in Indianapolis, for example, a combination of the latest surge in COVID-19 cases and a dire shortage of staff meant all the acute-care beds across the region were full.Lindsay Moore-Ostby, a family doctor in the city and member of the advocacy groupPhysicians for Patient Protection, says one doctor dealing with that crisis tried to transfer a patient, personally calling every hospital within several states — around 40 hospitals — she recalls.This doctor was "trying desperately to find a bed for a patient who needed ICU care," Moore-Ostby says. At that point, the doctor told her: " 'Now I'm spending time trying to make this transfer happen — so, what if I can't provide the care I need to the other patients who need me?' ""It's really a game of dominoes," adds Moore-Ostby, "where the doctor is just emotionally devastated because they can't fix it."A few months into the pandemic, Moore-Ostby started her own concierge practice, cutting backon her roster of patients. She did so, she says, primarily because having no time to talk to patients robbed her of what had led her to the profession in the first place."That little bit of time connecting with the patients — that's what they like, that's what they need and deserve," she says. "And it's what I love about medicine."As the problem of burnout multiplies, some health care systems are trying to find solutions – discovering they often are found in the small details of the work.For much of this summer, Tampa emergency doctor Damian Caraballo couldn't staunch the flow of unvaccinated COVID-19 patients coming in. Nor could he stop the stampede of co-workers — nurses, EMTs, and lab techs — who kept leaving, making the pace of work more frantic for those who remained."Even things as simple as registration; we're short registration people, and that puts a delay on everything," Caraballo says. The average waiting time in his ER ballooned to over 10 hours. "So it has a downhill effect.""People keep saying, 'What is the one thing we can do?' There is no one solution. There are many.Christina MaslachOn balance, the pandemic has made all the normal bureaucratic hassles of the medical system that much more grating, Caraballo says. But he can also point to recent changes that have made a difference: His hospital started allowing remote monitoring of some COVID-19 patients."I've been able to send people home" if they have sufficient internet connectivity, says Caraballo, who is a member of patient-advocacy group Physicians for Patient Protection. Florida also recently relaxed rules about where patients could receive IV infusions of monoclonal antibodies to treat COVID-19, a move that also eased Caraballo's patient load. "All those things would take stress off the hospital because we wouldn't have to admit these patients."Since the pandemic began, retirement rates of nurses and doctors have accelerated. Matthew Crecelius says that increasing reliance on less-experienced health workers can hurt patients.Elaine Cromie for NPRhide captionSince the pandemic began, retirement rates of nurses and doctors have accelerated. Matthew Crecelius says that increasing reliance on less-experienced health workers can hurt patients.Certainly, chronic short-staffing and overwork are huge factors intensifying burnout. But better management can also help alleviate it, even under extreme conditions, says Christina Maslach, a psychologist at the University of California, Berkeley, whose Maslach Burnout Inventory is the basis of the World Health Organization's definition of the workplace syndrome."We have to get past this notion that the job is what it is and you can't fix it, you can't change it, you just have to deal with it no matter what," Maslach says.Often it is a collection of irritants at work that make people feel undervalued, disregarded and eventually burnt out, she says: "Little stuff. What are the chronic pebbles in your shoe?"She says the fixes, therefore, are often small and targeted.One of the most common complaints health care workers talk about, Maslach says, is a perfect example: not having a functioning copier.That might seem minor, she says. But what makes the broken Xerox so toxic is that it taps into a simmering rage that health care staff universally bemoan: The byzantine paperwork and insurance forms that suck up their after-hours and weekends. So having to hunt down a copier that isn't out of ink or jammed doesn't just make the patient backlog worse, it ignites an existing fury within.Maslach says she's seen huge morale boosts just from hospital management buying a new copier. In addition to making the work faster, "it gives people the sense they are being listened to, that they're being taken seriously," she says.And she says combating burnout means identifying and tackling these kinds of problems that plague the workplace."People keep saying, 'What is the one thing we can do?' " she says. "There is no one solution. There are many."Often the best suggestions come from those who do the work.Massachusetts General Hospital realized that early in the pandemic.As the nation's supply of rubber gloves ran critically low, a triage nurse came up with an idea for a plexiglass wall at a patient's bedside. It had arm holes cut into it, where a set of sleeve-like rubber gloves could be attached. That way, caregivers could slide their arms through and adjust a patient's oxygen line or check a pulse — it was quicker and safer and didn't require a new pair of gloves.Massachusetts General Hospital implemented a very simple idea from a triage nurse that cut down the number of rubber gloves needed to treat a patient.Kate Flock/MGH Photographyhide captionMassachusetts General Hospital implemented a very simple idea from a triage nurse that cut down the number of rubber gloves needed to treat a patient."I thought it was a great idea, so we implemented it very quickly," says Ali Raja, executive vice president of emergency medicine at Mass General. "And the triage staff absolutely loved it."One of the things they loved about it, Raja says, is that adopting staff ideas gave them a sense of agency over their work lives. "Implementing as many ideas as possible — especially if they're not very expensive — can definitely not only acknowledge the staff's expertise and what they're going through, but quite honestly can give you some really good solutions that the leadership just won't have thought of, because they don't have boots on the ground."He says staff came up with other ideas: to set up a COVID triage unit outdoors in the ambulance bay and to give iPads to patients, so they could more readily communicate with staff, who then didn't have to suit up in personal protective equipment.Another critical way of fighting burnout is addressing the mental health challenges that come with it. Officially or unofficially, many hospitals and workers talked about the importance of camaraderie.Some hospitals converted waiting rooms left vacant because of visiting restrictions, into staff lounges or to be used for peer counseling. Talking about the difficulties of managing work and life sometimes led to staff volunteering to cover for one another in family emergencies."I've been asking my friends for help when I've needed it," says Raja, and his co-workers urged him to seek therapy for the first time. "That's not something I would've been willing to do, but the fact is, so many of my colleagues have acknowledged that same burnout and told me how much that helped."ER doc Damian Caraballo says he encourages the same at his hospital in Tampa: "Offer moral support for them. In the short term, I think that's the best we can do."For the most part, there are not too many quick ways to solve burnout, he says. It doesn't help knowing the crush of work these days is largely preventable; two-thirds of patients he sees are people with COVID-19 who didn't get vaccinated — even though they could have — often young people. That fact, combined with staff shortages, " it just creates this really tough environment that makes burnout even worse," Caraballo says.The worst part, say health care workers like traveling nurse Crecelius, is that burnout is robbing them of their sense of purpose — making it harder to care about the work itself."Last year this time, I had a greater sense of 'This is kind of my duty,' " says Crecelius, who says he's always had an instinct to run toward disaster — wherever help is most needed. While working in the hotspots during the early months of the pandemic, he says, he told himself: " 'I'm able, I'm young; I can make a difference. Let's go and see if we can put this fire out.' "Matthew Crecelius says that the nursing work he does feels different to him now than when he first began. Though he's a fifth-generation nurse, he is looking to switch careers.Elaine Cromie for NPRhide captionMatthew Crecelius says that the nursing work he does feels different to him now than when he first began. Though he's a fifth-generation nurse, he is looking to switch careers.In those days, he donned a kind of emotional armor, he says — muscling through shifts during which he lost patient after patient, then prepared them for the morgue.Then, on a road trip this summer in an RV he built with his wife, Crecelius was standing in line at a grocery store, waiting to buy bananas and yogurt, when he glanced at a tabloid with a cover story about the pandemic."And it had a picture of someone loading zipped-up bodies onto a truck," he remembers. "I lost it."He trembled as he looked at the picture, flooded with memories of volunteering to load bodies into the morgue. He thought of the families he'd helped say goodbye, holding a phone to the ear of his patient.The work feels different to him now, Crecelius says. Though he's a fifth-generation nurse, he is looking to switch careers."Now that there is a vaccine, people aren't getting it," he says. Nursing has changed for him.

Breakthrough COVID-19 cases were reported in the musical's companyNEW YORK — The Broadway hit "Aladdin" is trying to keep COVID-19 contained.Disney Theatrical Productions said it will cancel Friday's performance and all shows until Oct. 12 after "additional breakthrough COVID-19 cases were detected."The show reopened Tuesday following some 18 months of being shuttered due to the pandemic, but was forced to close Wednesday when breakthrough COVID-19 cases were reported within the musical's company. It restarted Thursday but Friday proved too much. In many ways, the temporary closure proves that the monitoring system is working."This 12-day pause allows the 'Aladdin' company ample time to ensure that people with breakthroughs recover, and any other potential breakthroughs are identified before the 'Aladdin' company gathers again," Dr. Blythe Adamson, the epidemiologist working with Disney Theatrical Productions, said in a statement.So-called breakthrough infections are detected in vaccinated people and tend to be far less dangerous than those unvaccinated.Adamson said she believes "these positive cases are most likely related to an exposure from one positive case." She has instituted daily PCR testing. The show vowed to support "affected 'Aladdin' company members as they recover.""Aladdin," a musical adaptation of the 1992 animated movie starring Robin Williams, opened on Broadway in March 2014 and has become one of its highest grossing shows.It was the first Broadway COVID-19 cancellation since shows resumed with Bruce Springsteen's concert returning in July and "Pass Over" as the first play to debut in August.The pandemic forced Broadway theaters to abruptly close on March 12, 2020, knocking out all shows and scrambling the spring season. Several have restarted, including the so-called big three of "Wicked," "Hamilton" and "The Lion King."All tickets for the canceled performances will be refunded at the original point of purchase.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

Despite a decline in COVID-19 cases in the United States over the last several weeks the country's total deaths are close to 700,000.MINNEAPOLIS — The United States reached its latest heartbreaking pandemic milestone Friday, eclipsing 700,000 deaths from COVID-19 just as the surge from the delta variant isstarting to slow downand give overwhelmed hospitals some relief.It took 3 ½ months for the U.S. to go from 600,000 to 700,000 deaths, driven by the variant's rampant spread through unvaccinated Americans. The death toll is larger than the population of Boston.The latest milestone is deeply frustrating to public health leaders and medical professionals on the front lines because vaccines have been available to all eligible Americans for nearly six months and the shots overwhelmingly protect against hospitalizations and death. An estimated 70 million eligible Americans remain unvaccinated, providing kindling for the variant.Health experts say the fourth wave of the pandemic has peaked overall in the U.S., particularly in the Deep South, where hospitals were stretched to the limit weeks ago. But many Northern states are still struggling with rising cases, and what's ahead for winter is far less clear.Unknowns include how flu season may strain  already depleted hospital staffs and whether those who have refused to get vaccinated will change their minds.An estimated 70 million eligible Americans remain unvaccinated, providing kindling for the highly contagious delta variant."If you're not vaccinated or have protection from natural infection, this virus will find you," warned Mike Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy.Registered nurse Noleen Nobleza inoculates Julio Quinones with a COVID-19 vaccine in Orange, Calif.Jae C.

New cases are on the downswing at about 112,000 per day on average, a drop of about one-third over the past 2 1/2 weeks.Deaths, too, appear to be declining, averaging about 1,900 a day versus more than 2,000 about a week ago, though on Friday the U.S. reached theheartbreaking milestone of 700,000 dead overallsince the pandemic began.The easing of the summer surge has been attributed to more mask wearing and more people getting vaccinated. The decrease in case numbers could also be due to the virus having burned through susceptible people and running out of fuel in some places.In another promising development, Merck said Friday its experimental pill for people sick with COVID-19 reduced hospitalizations and deaths by half. If it wins authorization from regulators, it will be the first pill for treating COVID-19 — and an important, easy-to-use new weapon in the arsenal against the pandemic.All treatments now authorized in the U.S. against the coronavirus require an IV or injection.Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government's top infectious disease specialist, warned on Friday that some may see the encouraging trends as a reason to remain unvaccinated."It's good news we're starting to see the curves" coming down, he said. "That is not an excuse to walk away from the issue of needing to get vaccinated."Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, began seeing a surge of COVID-19 hospitalizations in mid-July, and by the first week of August, the place was beyond capacity. It stopped elective surgeries and brought in military doctors and nurses to help care for patients.With cases now down, the military team is scheduled to leave at the end of October.Still, the hospital's chief medical officer, Dr. Catherine O'Neal, said the rate of hospitalizations isn't decreasing as quickly as cases in the community because the delta variant is affecting more young people who are otherwise healthy and are living much longer in the intensive care unit on ventilators."It creates a lot of ICU patients that don't move anywhere," she said. And many of the patients aren't going home at all. In the last few weeks, the hospital saw several days with more than five COVID-19 deaths daily, including one day when there were 10 deaths."We lost another dad in his 40s just a few days ago," O'Neal said. "It's continuing to happen. And that's what the tragedy of COVID is."As for where the outbreak goes from here, "I have to tell you, my crystal ball has broken multiple times in the last two years," she said. But she added that the hospital has to be prepared for another surge at the end of November, as flu season also ramps up.Dr. Sandra Kemmerly, system medical director for hospital quality at Ochsner Health in Louisiana, said this fourth surge of the pandemic has been harder. "It's just frustrating for people to die of vaccine-preventable illnesses," she said.At the peak of this most recent wave, Ochsner hospitals had 1,074 COVID-19 patients on Aug. 9. That had dropped to 208 as of Thursday.Other hospitals are seeing decreases as well. The University of Mississippi Medical Center had 146 hospitalized COVID-19 patients at its mid-August peak. That was down to 39 on Friday. Lexington Medical Center in West Columbia, South Carolina, had more than 190 in early September but just 49 on Friday.But Kemmerly doesn't expect the decrease to last. "I fully expect to see more hospitalizations due to COVID," she said.Like many other health professionals, Natalie Dean, a professor of biostatistics at Emory University, is taking a cautious view about the winter.It is unclear if the coronavirus will take on the seasonal pattern of the flu, with predictable peaks in the winter as people gather indoors for the holidays. Simply because of the nation's size and diversity, there will be places that have outbreaks and surges, she said.What's more, the uncertainties of human behavior complicate the picture. People react to risk by taking precautions, which slows viral transmission. Then, feeling safer, people mingle more freely, sparking a new wave of contagion."Infectious disease models are different from weather models," Dean said. "A hurricane doesn't change its course because of what the model said."One influential model, from the University of Washington, projects new cases will bump up again this fall, but vaccine protection and infection-induced immunity will prevent the virus from taking as many lives as it did last winter.Still, the model predicts about 90,000 more Americans will die by Jan. 1 for an overall death toll of 788,000 by that date. The model calculates that about half of those deaths could be averted if almost everyone wore masks in public."Mask wearing is already heading in the wrong direction," said Ali Mokdad, a professor of health metrics sciences at the university. "We need to make sure we are ready for winter because our hospitals are exhausted."Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

Pharmaceutical company Merck & Co. announced Friday, that its experimental COVID-19 pill reduced hospitalizations and deaths by half in people recently infected with the coronavirus and that it would soon ask health officials in the U.S. and around the world to authorize its use.WASHINGTON — Merck & Co. said Friday that its experimental COVID-19 pill reduced hospitalizations and deaths by half in people recently infected with the coronavirus and that it would soon ask health officials in the U.S. and around the world to authorize its use.If cleared, Merck's drug would be the first pill shown to treat COVID-19, a potentially major advance in efforts to fight the pandemic. All COVID-19 therapies now authorized in the U.S. require an IV or injection.Merck and its partner Ridgeback Biotherapeutics said early results showed patients who received the drug, called molnupiravir, within five days of COVID-19 symptoms had about half the rate of hospitalization and death as patients who received a dummy pill. The study tracked 775 adults with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 who were considered higher risk for severe disease due to health problems such as obesity, diabetes or heart disease.Among patients taking molnupiravir, 7.3% were either hospitalized or died at the end of 30 days, compared with 14.1% of those getting the dummy pill. There were no deaths in the drug group after that time period compared with eight deaths in the placebo group, according to Merck. The results were released by the company and have not been peer reviewed. Merck said it plans to present them at a future medical meeting.An independent group of medical experts monitoring the trial recommended stopping it early because the interim results were so strong. Company executives said they are in discussions with the Food and Drug Administration and plan submit the data for review in coming days."It exceeded what I thought the drug might be able to do in this clinical trial," said Dr. Dean Li, vice president of Merck research. "When you see a 50% reduction in hospitalization or death that's a substantial clinical impact."Side effects were reported by both groups in the Merck trial, but they were slightly more common among the group that received a dummy pill. The company did not specify the problems.Earlier study results showed the drug did not benefit patients who were already hospitalized with severe disease.The U.S. has approved one antiviral drug, remdesivir, specifically for COVID-19, and allowed emergency use of three antibody therapies that help the immune system fight the virus. But all the drugs have to be given by IV or injection at hospitals or medical clinics, and supplies have been stretched by the latest surge of the delta variant.Health experts including the top U.S. infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci have long called for a convenient pill that patients could take when COVID-19 symptoms first appear, much the way the decades-old flu medication Tamiflu helps fight influenza. Such medications are seen as key to controlling future waves of infection and reducing the impact of the pandemic.Merck's pill works by interfering with an enzyme the coronavirus uses to copy its genetic code and reproduce itself. It has shown similar activity against other viruses.The U.S. government has committed to purchase 1.7 million doses of the drug if it is authorized by the FDA. Merck has said it can produce 10 million doses by the end of the year and has contracts with governments worldwide. The company has not announced prices.Several other companies, including Pfizer and Roche, are studying similar drugs that could report results in the coming weeks and months.Merck had planned to enroll more than 1,500 patients in its late-stage trial before the independent board stopped it early. The results reported Friday included patients enrolled across Latin America, Europe and Africa. Executives estimated about 10% of patients studied were from the U.S.The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

Emily FengA woman buys groceries from a mini market using a lightbulb powered by a generator during a blackout in Shenyang, China, on Wednesday.Olivia Zhang/APhide captionA woman buys groceries from a mini market using a lightbulb powered by a generator during a blackout in Shenyang, China, on Wednesday.BEIJING — Here is a riddle: China has more than enough power plants to meet electricity demand. So why are local governments having to ration power across the country?The search for an answer begins with the pandemic."Coal consumption shot up like crazy in the first half of the year because of a very energy-intensive, industry-driven recovery from the COVID-19 lockdowns," says Lauri Myllyvirta, lead analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air in Helsinki.In other words, as China's export machine roared back to life, electricity-guzzling factories churned out fast fashion and home appliances for customers in the United States and elsewhere. Regulators also loosened controls on coal-intensive sectors like steelmaking as a wayto recoverfrom China's pandemic-inducedeconomic slowdown.Now thermal coal hastripled in priceon some commodities exchanges. About 90% of coal used in China is domestically mined, but mining volumes from some of China's northern provinces have dropped by as much as 17.7%,accordingto respected Chinese financial magazineCaijing.Normally, those higher coal prices would have been passed on to energy consumers. But electricity utility rates are capped. This mismatch has pushed power plants to the brink of financial collapse because higher coal prices have forced them to operate at a loss. In September, 11 Beijing-based power generation companiespenned an open letterpetitioninga central policy decision-making body, the National Development and Reform Commission, to raise electricity rates."When coal prices are very high, what happens is that it's not profitable for a lot of coal plants to generate electricity," Myllyvirta says.The result: Coal-fired power plants have simply shut down.A man uses his smartphone flashlight to light up his bowl of noodles as he eats breakfast at a restaurant during a blackout in Shenyang, in northeastern China's Liaoning province, Wednesday. People ate breakfast by flashlight and shopkeepers used portable generators as power cuts imposed to meet official conservation goals disrupted manufacturing and daily life.Olivia Zhang/APhide captionA man uses his smartphone flashlight to light up his bowl of noodles as he eats breakfast at a restaurant during a blackout in Shenyang, in northeastern China's Liaoning province, Wednesday. People ate breakfast by flashlight and shopkeepers used portable generators as power cuts imposed to meet official conservation goals disrupted manufacturing and daily life."Now we have a situation where in some provinces up to 50% of coal-fired power plants are pretending to be out of order or have run so low on coal that they can't generate," he says. About 57% of China's power comes fromburning coal.In China's north, sudden power outages have led to flickering traffic lights and immense car jams. Some cities have said they areshutting off elevatorsto conserve energy. To fight off the autumn chill, some residents are burning coal or gas indoors; 23 people wererushedto the hospital in northern Jilin city with carbon monoxide poisoning after doing so without proper ventilation.To the south, factories have been cut off from electricity for more than a week. The lucky ones are rationed three to seven days of power at a time.Energy intensive sectors like textiles and plastics face the strictest power rationing, a measure meant to ameliorate both the current shortages but also work toward long-term emissions reduction goals. China's latest five-year economic plantargetsa 13.5% reduction in the amount of energy used to produce each unit of gross domestic product by 2025.Ge Caofei, a manager at a textile dyeing factory in southern Zhejiang province, say the local government is rationing power by cutting off his electricity three out of every 10 days. He says he even looked into buying a diesel generator, but his factory is just too big to be powered by one."Customers need to plan in advance when placing orders, because our lights are on for seven days, then off for three," he says. "This policy is unavoidable because every [textile] factory around us is under the same cap."The power rationing has created long delays in global supply chains that rely on Chinese factories.Viola Zhou, a sales director at Zhejiang cotton textile printing firm Baili Heng, says her company used to fill orders in 15 days. Now the wait time is about 30 to 40 days."There is no way around these rules. Let's say you buy a generator; regulators can easily check your gas or water meter to see how many resources you are consuming," Zhou says by phone from Shaoxing, a city known for its textile industry. "We can only follow in the steps of the government here."China isreformingits energy grid so power plantshave more flexibilityin how much they can charge. Some of those higher power costswill be passedfrom factories to global consumers. Long term, the power rationing highlights how urgently needed renewable energy and natural gas projects are.The national energy policy commission said this week it wasworking to stabilizemedium- and long-term coal contracts between mines and power plants andwill reduce the amountof coal that power plants must keep on hand, in a bid to ease the financial pressure on the sector.More immediate problems are on hand with winter approaching. About 80% ofheatingin China is coal-fired. Coaxing power plants to operate in the red could be a challenge.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

Primetta Giacopini was two years old when she lost her mother to the Spanish flu in 1918. Primetta Giacopini contracted COVID-19 earlier this month and died on Sept. 16.Josh Edelson/APhide captionDorene Giacopini holds up a photo of her mother Primetta Giacopini at her home in Richmond, Calif., on Monday. Primetta Giacopini was two years old when she lost her mother to the Spanish flu in 1918. Primetta Giacopini contracted COVID-19 earlier this month and died on Sept. 16.She lived a life of adventure that spanned two continents. She fell in love with a World War II fighter pilot, barely escaped Europe ahead of Benito Mussolini's fascists, ground steel for the U.S. war effort and advocated for her disabled daughter in a far less enlightened time. She was, her daughter said, someone who didn't make a habit of giving up.And then this month, at age 105, Primetta Giacopini's life ended the way it began — in a pandemic."I think my mother would have been around quite a bit longer" if she hadn't contracted COVID," her 61-year-old daughter, Dorene Giacopini, said. "She was a fighter. She had a hard life and her attitude always was ... basically, all Americans who were not around for World War II were basically spoiled brats."Primetta Giacopini's mother, Pasquina Fei, died in Connecticut of the flu in 1918 at age 25. That flu pandemic killed about 675,000 Americans — a death toll eclipsed this monthby the 2020-21 coronavirus pandemic.Primetta was 2 years old when her mother died. Her father, a laborer, didn't want to raise Primetta or her younger sister, Alice. He sent Alice back to Italy, their ancestral homeland, and handed Primetta to an Italian foster family that then relocated to Italy in 1929."The way Mom talked about it, he didn't want to raise those kids alone, and men didn't do that at that time," Dorene recalled. "It's ridiculous to me."Primetta supported herself by working as a seamstress. Raven-haired with dark eyes and sharp features, she eventually fell in love with an Italian fighter pilot named Vittorio Andriani."I didn't see too much of him because he was always fighting someplace," Primetta told the Golden Gate Wing, a military aviation club in Oakland, California, in 2008.A note from President Biden, with greetings upon her 105th birthday, is seen placed among photos of Primetta Giacopini, who died after contracting COVID-19 earlier this month.Josh Edelson/APhide captionA note from President Biden, with greetings upon her 105th birthday, is seen placed among photos of Primetta Giacopini, who died after contracting COVID-19 earlier this month.Italy entered World War II in June 1940. The local police warned Primetta to leave because Mussolini wanted American citizens out of the country. Primetta refused. Several weeks later, the state police told her to get out, warning her that she could end up in a concentration camp.In June 1941, Andriani was missing in action; Primetta learned later that he had crashed and died near Malta. While he was missing, she joined a group of strangers making their way out of Italy on a train to Portugal."In Spain, one can still see, after 2-3 years, the traces of the atrocities of the past," Primetta wrote in a letter to a friend in the midst of her flight. "At Port Bou, the Spanish border, not one house is left standing; everting got destroyed because the town is an important train transit point that brought supplies to the "Reds", the enemy . . . I've seen so much destruction that I've had enough. The day after tomorrow, I get on the ship, and I'm sure all will go well."In Lisbon she boarded a steamer bound for the United States. She returned to Torrington, bought a Chevrolet sedan for $500 and landed a job at a General Motors plant in Bristol grinding steel to cover ball bearings for the war effort. She met her husband, Umbert "Bert" Giacopini, on the job. They stayed married until he died in 2002.Primetta gave birth to Dorene in 1960 and received devastating news: The infant had been born with spina bifida, a birth defect in which the spinal cord doesn't fully develop. For the first 50 years of her life, Dorene needed crutches to walk. Worried that Dorene would slip during Connecticut's winters, the family moved to San Jose in 1975."My folks were born a long time ago," she said. "Their attitude about disability, and my mother's attitude about disability, was it was lucky I was smart and I should get a good job I really liked because I probably wouldn't be getting married or have children. They did not take parenting classes."But Primatta was "pushy," Dorene said, and never stopped fighting for her.She once convinced school officials to move accelerated classes from the third floor of Dorene's school to the first floor so Dorene could participate. During the springs in Connecticut, she demanded that city sweepers clear their street of salt and sand so Dorene wouldn't slip.This year, during a visit on Sept. 9, Dorene noticed her mother was coughing. She knew her mother's caretaker had been feeling sick after her husband returned from a wedding in Idaho. All three had been vaccinated. But as she drove away, Dorene guessed that her mother had contracted COVID-19."I made sure we said 'I love you.'" She did the 'See you later, alligator.' I think we both said 'After a while, crocodile,'" Dorene said. "That was the last time I saw her."Two days later, Primetta was in the emergency room. Her oxygen levels dropped steadily over the next six days until nurses had to put an oxygen mask on her.She became confused and fought them so hard she had to be sedated, Dorene said. Chest X-rays told the story: pneumonia. Faced with a decision of whether to put Primetta on a ventilator — "They said nobody over 80 makes it off a ventilator," Dorene said — she decided to remove her mother's oxygen.Primetta died two days later, on Sept. 16. She was 105 years old."She had such a strong heart that she remained alive for more than 24 hours after they removed the oxygen," Dorene said. "I'm full of maybes, what I should have done with the ventilator . . . (but) it broke through three vaccinated people."She added: "I'm reminding myself that she was 105. We always talk about ... my grandmother and mother, the only thing that could kill them was a worldwide pandemic."Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Aneri PattaniFromTravis Warner of Dallas got tested for the coronavirus at a free-standing emergency room in June 2020 after one of his colleagues tested positive for the virus. The emergency room bill included a $54,000 charge for one test.Laura Buckman for KHNhide captionTravis Warner of Dallas got tested for the coronavirus at a free-standing emergency room in June 2020 after one of his colleagues tested positive for the virus. The emergency room bill included a $54,000 charge for one test.When COVID-19 struck last year, Travis Warner's company became busier than ever. He installs internet and video systems in Texas, and with people suddenly working from home, service calls surged.He and his employees took precautions such as wearing masks and physically distancing. But visiting clients' homes daily meant a high risk of exposure to the coronavirus."It was just like dodging bullets every week," Warner says.In June 2020, an employee tested positive. That sent Warner and his wife on their own hunt for a test.Because of limited testing availability at the time, they drove 30 minutes from their home in Dallas to a free-standing emergency room in Lewisville, Texas. They received PCR diagnostic tests for the coronavirus, as well as rapid antigen tests.When all their results came back negative, it was a huge relief, Warner says. He eagerly got back to work.Then the bill came.The patient:Travis Warner, 36, is self-employed and bought his health plan from Molina Healthcare via HealthCare.gov.Medical service:Two"COVID tests" for the coronavirus— a diagnostic PCR test, which typically takes a few days to process and is quite accurate, and a rapid antigen test, which is less accurate but produces results in minutes.Total bill:$56,384, including $54,000 for the PCR test and the balance for the antigen test and an ER facility fee. Molina's negotiated rate for both tests and the facility fee totaled $16,915.20, which the insurer paid in full.Service provider:SignatureCare Emergency Center in Lewisville, one of more than a dozen free-standing ERs the company owns across Texas.What gives:Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic,stories of shockingly high pricesfor coronavirus tests have abounded. Arecent report from an insurance trade associationnotes that "price gouging by certain providers continues to be a widespread problem." Warner's PCR bill of $54,000 was "astronomical" and "egregious," according to health policy researchers we talked to.Yet it's perfectly legal. For coronavirus tests — like much else in American health care — there is no cap to what providers can charge, saysLoren Adler, associate director of the USC-Brookings Schaeffer Initiative for Health Policy.Testing for the coronavirus has been in a special category, however. When the pandemic hit, lawmakers worried that people might avoid necessary testing for fear of the cost. So they passed legislation thatrequired insurers to pay for these tests— withoutcopaysorcost sharingfor the patient.For in-network providers, insurers can negotiate prices for the tests, and for out-of-network providers, they're generally required to pay whatever price the providers list publicly on their websites. The free-standing ER was out of network for Warner's plan.While the policy was intended to help patients, health policy analysts say, it hasunintentionally given health care providers leewayto charge arbitrary, sometimes absurd prices, knowing that insurers are required to pay and that patients, who won't be billed, are unlikely to complain."People are going to charge what they think they can get away with," saysNiall Brennan, president and CEO of the Health Care Cost Institute, a nonprofit that studies health care prices. "Even a perfectly well-intentioned provision like this can be hijacked by certain unscrupulous providers for nefarious purposes."Areport from the Kaiser Family Foundationthis year found that hospital charges for coronavirus tests ranged from $20 to $1,419 — not including physician or facility fees, which can often behigher than the cost of the tests themselves. About half the test charges were below $200, the report noted, but 1 in 5 were more than $300."We observed a broad range of COVID-19 testing prices, even within the same hospital system," the authors wrote.Realistically, the cost of such a test should be in the double digits, Brennan says. "Low triple digits if we're being generous."Medicare pays $100 for the test, and at-home tests are sold for as little as $24 for an antigen test or $119 for a PCR test.Warner's charges were fully covered by his insurance.But insurance policy premiums reflect how much is paid to providers. "If the insurance company is paying astronomical sums of money for your care, that means, in turn, that you are going to be paying higher premiums," Adler says.Taxpayers, who subsidize marketplace insurance plans, also face a greater burden when premiums increase. Even people who have employer-sponsored health coverage feel the pain. Research shows that each increase of $1 in an employer's health costs isassociated with a 52-cent cutto an employee's overall compensation.Even before the pandemic, wide variability in the prices for common procedures such as cesarean sections and blood tests had been driving up the cost of health care, Brennan says. These discrepancies "happen every single day, millions of times a day."Resolution:When Warner saw that his insurance company had paid the bill, he first thought, "At least I'm not liable for anything."But the absurdity of the $54,000 charge gnawed at him. His wife, who'd received the same tests the same day at the same place, was billed $2,000. She has a separate insurance policy, which settled the claim for less than $1,000.Warner called his insurer to see if someone could explain the charge. After a game of phone tag with the ER and the ER's billing firm, as well as several months of waiting, Warner received another letter from his insurer. It said the insurer had since audited the claim and taken back most of the money it originally paid the ER.In a written statement, a spokesperson for Molina Healthcare told us, "This matter was a provider billing error which Molina identified and corrected."SignatureCare Emergency Centers, which issued the $54,000 charge, said it would not comment on a specific patient's bill. However, in a written statement, it said that its billing error rate is less than 2% and that it has a "robust audit process" to flag errors. At the height of the pandemic, SignatureCare ERs faced "unprecedented demands" and processed thousands of records a day, the company said.SignatureCare's website nowlists the chargefor coronavirus tests as $175.The takeaway:According to laws passed by Congress, testing for the coronavirus should be free to consumers during the public health emergency (currently extended through mid-October and likely to be renewed for an additional 90 days). Warner did his insurer a big favor by looking carefully at his bill, even though he didn't owe anything.Insurers are supposed to have systems that flag billing errors and prevent overpayment. This includes authorization requirements before services are rendered and audits after claims are filed.But "there's a question of how well they work," Adler says. "In this case, it's lucky [Warner] noticed."At least one estimatesays 3% to 10% of health care spending in the U.S. goes to overpayment, including cases of fraud, waste and abuse.Unfortunately, that means the onus for keeping charges at least a little more reasonable is often on the patient.You should always read your bill carefully, experts say. If the cost seems inappropriate, call your insurer and ask it to double-check and explain the cost to you.That shouldn't be your job, experts agree, but in the long run, fewer overpayments will save money for you and for others in the American health care system.Bill of the Month is a crowdsourced investigation byNPRandKHNthat dissects and explains medical bills.

Sharon Pruitt-YoungYouTube has announced immediate bans on false claims that vaccines are dangerous and cause health issues such as autism, cancer or infertility.Danny Moloshok/APhide captionYouTube has announced immediate bans on false claims that vaccines are dangerous and cause health issues such as autism, cancer or infertility.YouTube is cracking down on the spread of misinformation by banning misleading and inaccurate content about vaccines.The platform announced the change in ablog postWednesday, explaining that its current community guidelines, which already prohibit the sharing of medical misinformation, have been extended to cover "currently administered" vaccines that have been proven safe by the World Health Organization and other health officials.The site had previously banned content containing false claims about COVID-19 vaccines under itsCOVID-19 misinformation policy. The change extends that policy to a far wider number of vaccines."We've steadily seen false claims about the coronavirus vaccines spill over into misinformation about vaccines in general, and we're now at a point where it's more important than ever to expand the work we started with COVID-19 to other vaccines," the company said.YouTube said it now bans videos that claim vaccines aren't safe or effective or cause other health issues such as cancer and infertility. In its announcement, the company pointed specifically to videos that inaccurately describe what ingredients are used in vaccines as well as allegations that vaccines contain properties that can be used to "track" those who receive them.There are some exceptions: Users are still allowed to share content related to their personal experiences with the vaccine, but only if those videos adhere to the site's community guidelines and the channel in question doesn't routinely encourage "vaccine hesitancy."The new mandate goes into effect immediately, and YouTube has already removed pages known for sharing anti-vaccination sentiments such as those belonging toprominent vaccine opponentsJoseph Mercola, Erin Elizabeth, Sherri Tenpenny and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s Children's Health Defense organization,CNBCreported.But the company, which is owned by Google, warned the more widespread removal of videos may take some time as it works to enforce the policy.As big tech companies such as YouTube and Facebook have tightened their restrictions regarding vaccine misinformation over the last year, many conspiracy theorists began migrating to other less-regulated platforms. Rumble, another video-sharing site, has become a popular choice for far-right groups and others who are vaccine-resistant,Slatereported in March.But many conservative pages that spread vaccine misinformation are still active on YouTube, and their videos continue to attract millions of views.Editor's note:Google is among NPR's financial supporters.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Scott NeumanLong COVID patient Gary Miller receives treatment from physiotherapist Joan Del Arco at the Long COVID Clinic at King George Hospital in Ilford, London, in May.Kirsty Wigglesworth/APhide captionLong COVID patient Gary Miller receives treatment from physiotherapist Joan Del Arco at the Long COVID Clinic at King George Hospital in Ilford, London, in May.Symptoms of COVID-19 persist or recur months after diagnosis for more than a third of all people who get the illness, a new study finds, potentially pushing the number of so-called long COVID cases higher than previously thought.In thestudypublished Tuesday in the journalPLOS Medicine, researchers found that about 36% of those studied still reported COVID-like symptoms three and six months after diagnosis. Most previous studies have estimated lingering post-COVID symptoms in 10% to 30% of patients.The study, led by University of Oxford scientists in the United Kingdom, searched anonymized data from millions of electronic health records, primarily in the United States, to identify a study group of 273,618 patients with COVID-19 and 114,449 patients with influenza as a control.Although long COVID is poorly defined, the researchers looked at such symptoms as chest/throat pain, abnormal breathing, abdominal symptoms, fatigue, depression, headaches, cognitive dysfunction and muscle pain."The research found that over 1 in 3 patients had one or more features of long-COVID recorded between 3 and 6 months after a diagnosis of COVID-19," the authors concluded.The researchers also found that of those who had long COVID three to six months after diagnosis, roughly 40% had no record of such symptoms in the prior three months.Months after the pandemic began, scientists, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert,warned about a post-viral syndromethat was showing up in people who had recovered from COVID. That led some to compare the symptoms experienced by many following COVID-19 to the same experience that some people have after other viral infections, such as the flu.But the new study concludes that the chances of getting COVID-19 symptoms months after the acute stage of the illness was more than twice as high as for   influenza.The Oxford-led team also found that people who had more severe COVID-19 illness were more likely to get long COVID. Likewise, female and young adult patients also had an elevated risk for the long-term symptoms, but the authors of the study found no difference between white and nonwhite patients.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

That's an increase of four states  — Delaware, Iowa, Ohio and Texas — in just a year.The findings confirm what several recent research studies have found: Many Americans have gained significant weight since the COVID-19 crisis started, likely fueled by an increase in sedentary behavior, stress and troubles such as job and income loss that make healthy eating harder.And those rates are rising faster among racial minorities."Obesity continues to be a significant public health crisis," saysNadine Gracia, a physician and president and CEO of Trust for America's Health, a health policy group thatrecently analyzedthe CDC's 2020 data. And growth in childhood obesity, she says, projects a worsening trend.Loading...The pandemic only exacerbated a problem that was already quickly accelerating in the last decade. In 2011, not a single state had reached the threshold of 35% obesity. Now, among the 16 at that level, a handful are close to 40%.  The rates are higher in the South and Midwest.The latest CDC data is based on a survey of people self-reporting their own height and weight, so if anything, the new data likelyunderstatesthe problem, saysDr. Fatima Cody Stanford, a leading obesity researcher at Harvard Medical School."When patients are reporting or individuals are reporting their weight, they tend to underreport. So I think that this report will under-capture, actually, the degree of obesity in the U.S.," she says.Stanford argues that obesity's growing prevalence has not met with adequate recognition that it is a disease. And because it goes largely unrecognized or untreated, it does not surprise her it continues to increase — especially during difficult times such as the last year and half of the pandemic and its economic and social fallout."When we look at factors that play a role in rising obesity, we know stress is one of them," she says.She says stress doesn't just affect exercise and eating patterns. It also prompts the body to store more fat. During the pandemic, other factors, including food insecurity and reduced access to recreation made it more likely that everyone from children to older adults would gain weight.Other research supports the finding that obesity rates increased in the pandemic.A March surveyfrom the American Psychological Association found 42% of Americans said they had gained more weight than intended, 29 pounds on average.A recent studythat gathered data from pediatric health records found a trend of weight gain among children, especially those ages 5 to 11. Among that age group, overweight or obesity increased from 36.2% to 45.7% during the pandemic.The pandemic revealed how the growth in obesity threatens the health of both individuals and the health care system. It makes people more vulnerable to hospitalization and death from COVID-19. At the same time, the pandemic worsened many of the social and economic factors that cause obesity, too. Job or income loss, for example, often means families cannot afford healthier food options.Gracia of Trust for America's Health says with obesity comes the threat of diabetes, heart or kidney disease, and cancer. That adds to an enormous financial cost."We spend about $149 billion a year on health care costs that are obesity-related," she says.There are big racial differences in the impact of obesity: A separate CDC survey from 2017-2018 showed nearly half of Black people and 57% of Black women have obesity. In the Latino population, the rate is nearly 45%; among white adults, 42%. Asian adults had the lowest rate at 17%.More minority families shouldered the economic brunt of the pandemic, saysDr. Elena Rios,president and CEO of the National Hispanic Medical Association, because they represent a greater share of the low-wage or essential workforce."I mean, there's just so much pressure on low-income families," she says. "Everybody has to pitch in and do something, [so] they don't take care of their health."Gracia says larger investments in healthier school meals and greater access to recreation are necessary to combat the growing problem. Minority communities especially need greater access to health insurance and medical care."Being able to access those services is important to receiving preventative services, counseling and supports to address obesity," she says.There are other community factors Rios points to as well: fewer local options for healthy food and less access to health insurance and care. And these factors can have a dire effect on people's health."Our communities don't get the messages that you're going to have diabetes earlier, you're going to have heart disease earlier in your life and by the time you're in your 30s and 40s, you're going to be on dialysis. That's the trend that's happening in our communities," she says.Given the stigma around obesity, crafting messages that resonate is not easy, saysTammy Boyd,chief policy officer of the Black Women's Health Imperative."It's a very delicate balance," she says, because using words such as "weight" easily sounds stigmatizing. But at the same time, Boyd says, the community needs to understand obesity as a critical health and wellness issue.For Boyd, one of the most promising potential remedies is medication. New classes of drugs are proving both safer and more effective than what's been on the market.Most insurance — including Medicare — does not cover them. Congress is considering a bill allowing Medicare to cover obesity drugs and behavioral counseling. Boyd says if the legislation passes, many other insurers would likely follow. And that might help curb some of the disturbing trend lines.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Dana FarringtonA health care worker fills syringes with doses of the COVID-19 vaccine in August in Southfield, Mich.Emily Elconin/Getty Imageshide captionA health care worker fills syringes with doses of the COVID-19 vaccine in August in Southfield, Mich.Surveys have shown that as many as half of unvaccinated workers say they will leave their jobs if they're forced to get the COVID-19 shot,but in reality few of them actually quit. That's according to an article in The Conversation, a nonprofit news organization that covers academic research.Researchers looked at companies that have vaccine mandates in place and saw that, so far, only a fraction of workers leave their jobs when it comes down to it."In other words, vaccine mandates are unlikely to result in a wave of resignations — but they are likely to lead to a boost in vaccination rates," they write.Here's some data they cite:"Houston Methodist Hospital, for example, required its 25,000 workers to get a vaccine by June 7. Before the mandate,about 15% of its employees were unvaccinated. By mid-June, that percentage had dropped to 3% and hit 2% by late July. A total of153 workers were fired or resigned, while another285 were granted medical or religious exemptionsand 332 were allowed to defer it."The situation seems to be playing out in New York, too, where fears of a mandate for health care workers have prompted officials to prepare for possible staffing shortages. But even there, the mandate appeared to force an uptick in vaccinations.The researchers say there are a few ways to minimize further the number of people who would quit over such a policy, including building trust with employees, making vaccination accessible and engaging trusted messengers such as doctors and family.This story originally published in theMorning Editionlive blog.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
NPR StaffTrevor Bedford, a computational virologist, has been named a MacArthur Fellow for his work on SARS-CoV-2. His early reaction: "Scary."Courtesy of John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundationhide captionTrevor Bedford, a computational virologist, has been named a MacArthur Fellow for his work on SARS-CoV-2. His early reaction: "Scary."Trevor Bedford is a computational virologist and professor at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle who has devoted his professional life to the pandemic for nearly two years.On February 29, 2020, he used Twitter to report that the genome of a COVID-19 case reported in Washington state showed the first known community transmission in the U.S. "There are some enormous implications here," he wrote. His prior work to track the evolution and spread of other viruses has been critical in understanding this global pandemic.On Feb 29, using the genetic sequence of the first community case of#COVID19in Washington State, I made the claim that the Washington State outbreak descended directly from the Jan 15 arrival of the WA1 case with direct travel history to Wuhan. 1/18https://t.co/8wWxtiotE3For his efforts, Bedford has been named aMacArthur Fellow— the so-called "genius grant" that comes with a $625,000 grant paid out over 5 years. This is on the heels of an astounding financial award – a 7-year, $9 million grant from theHoward Hughes Medical Institute. Robin Young, a host of NPR'sHere and Now, interviewed Bedfordto learn his thoughts on the origins, spread and possible future of the pandemic.This interview has been edited for length and clarity.So you've had quite a month.It's been an overwhelming September, trying to feel like I can contribute into the future.Clearly contributions are needed. Are you feeling pressure now?Yeah, and it's all wrapped up with the pandemic and feeling like I need to somehow try to fix COVID, and it's impossible to fix it. But that's going to be the mission at least.One thing that's helped is – can I call it "crowd-sourced virus tracking?"That's pretty close. We had back in 2015 a thing called "Next Flu" to try to look at how flu is circulating and help with influenza vaccine strain selection.And you used the same type of tracking to look at Ebola, Zika ...By 2019 we had a pretty good system to take publicly shared viral genome sequence data and very quickly build an evolutionary tree or a family tree and use that tree to understand spatial spread and what's going on ...The genome is the genetic blueprint?Mmm hmm.And then you ...When the first genomes for the novel coronavirus were shared on January 11 in 2020 we immediately had that built and rebuilt [for] a real-time view of what's circulating and how the pandemic is spreading.What was your early reaction to this novel coronavirus?Noticing it was a SARS-like coronavirus which is already scary.Any other concerns?[Knowing] how quickly coronaviruses evolve. That the initial infection was only in November 2019 and had very quickly ramped, this let us understand how much human-to-human transmission there was at a time when it's not acknowledged that there was human-to-human transmission.How did you built the family tree of the virus?We need people and groups from across the world to share their data. And during the pandemic that's been remarkable. We're looking for particular mutations that are shared among those samples.What does that tell you along with other data points, like international travelers who've been infected by the novel coronavirus?We're able to estimate the number of secondary infections that one infection causes. On January 23 [2020] we have a public report, we have an "R nought" of 3. And 3 is a really terrifying R nought.Define R nought.It means how many infections on average does one infection cause. Flu has an R nought of 2.Having an R nought of 3 gives you a lot of exponential growth. That is what led to the pandemic very quickly spreading.And you felt ...That week mid-January 2020 was rough. For a while it felt like I had this special knowledge that I was trying to share with public health [like] WHO.CDC and kind of being alone with this knowledge. Eventually things caught up, which almost made it better in this tragic and ridiculous way.Now your software is being used around the world – and helping analyze, for example, the spread of the delta strain.Right now delta has basically taken over the world in a fashion that I don't think many people would have predicted back in April. And we're watching very closely for the emergence of a sublineage of delta that has additional mutations on top of delta that is going to be the next thing to worry about.Has your own life changed?It actually has gotten difficult to remember what it was like before. It's been cycles of overwork and burnout, and then particular things cropping up that require more attention like when the variants first emerged.Do you have any thoughts about the future of this virus?If we compare SARS-CoV-2 to influenza virus I think it's a helpful analogy. The evolution of SARS-CoV-2 up to this point has been faster [than the influenza virus]. Having something that's that evolvable suggests that it will be able to keep evolving. We'll have to keep updating vaccines.And the R nought factor [of] 3, which was terrifying back in January 2020, with delta it's now 5 or 6.If 3 was "horrifying," what can you say about 5 or 6?This is why places like Vietnam that were able to control the original form have struggled with delta. Because of this high rate of evolution it suggests that you'd have something that's [going to become] the worst of our seasonal respiratory diseases.What about this winter?I expect there to be a winter wave. However, we had a number of infections pulled forward by this delta late summer wave that has created its own immunity. Five percent of the U.S. has perhaps gotten delta at this point. So [winter] actually might not be so bad. But looking forward to 2022, 2023 — once this [coronavirus] is endemic that's where my comparison with flu comes it, where it's looking like a severe flu season every winter.For your own future, what do these prizes mean?It's the scientific dream of having sustained funding to be directed in whatever fashion you'd want, and that's amazing.How does that make you feel?It's really been difficult for me to reconcile that with feeling like [these prizes are] coming out of my work on the pandemic. It's hard to accept things given that it came out of such terrible circumstances.So you don't want to benefit from the global pain of the pandemic?Yeah.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Andrea HsuShannon BondThe waiting area of a pop-up vaccination site at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York City sits empty as the rush for vaccinations winds down in June.David Dee Delgado/Getty Imageshide captionThe waiting area of a pop-up vaccination site at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York City sits empty as the rush for vaccinations winds down in June.More and more employers are ordering workers to get vaccinated against COVID-19 without the option of getting tested instead. Now workers are pushing back.In Washington, D.C.,more than 400 fire and emergency medical workersapplied for religious exemptions to the city's vaccine mandate. In Los Angeles,roughly a quarter of the police departmentis expected to seek religious exemptions.How many of those requests will ultimately be approved is unknown. Already, some employers are taking a harder line than others. Under the law, employers have a lot of discretion when granting religious exemptions.The right to request a religious exemption stems fromTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which protects workers from discrimination on the basis of religion, among other things. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission says employers must provide reasonable accommodations for workers who have sincerely held religious beliefs — unless doing so poses an undue hardship.There's a lot to unpack there.First, employers may probe whether an employee's religious belief is in fact sincere. They may ask questions about that employee's vaccination history or church attendance. If the employer determines the belief is not sincere, it may deny the exemption request.But even if an employee's religious belief is determined to be sincere, it's the employer who decides what the reasonable accommodation will be. It does not have to be the accommodation requested by the employee.What one employer deems to be reasonable, another may not.In Conway, Ark., Matt Troup, CEO of Conway Regional Health System, has granted 45 religious exemptions to employees who refused to get a COVID-19 vaccine. Their objections were largely based on the employees' beliefs that vaccines that used fetal cells in research, testing or production should not be put in their bodies.(Public health officials sayfetal cell lines developed decades ago in the laboratory were used to develop and test the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines — a common practice in pharmaceutical research. Other fetal cell lines are being used in the production of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. But the vaccines themselves do not contain any fetal cells.)Before granting the religious exemptions, Troup sent the employees a list of 28 commonly used medicines that also used fetal cells in their research, testing or development — a list that includes Tylenol, Motrin, Tums, Ex-Lax and other medicine cabinet staples. He asked employees to attest to not be using any of those medicines.As part of an education campaign, Conway Regional Health System sent this form out to employees who requested religious exemptions to the hospital's COVID-19 vaccine mandate.Conway Regional Health Systemhide caption"They need to know that if they're going to be consistent in their beliefs, that applies to a lot of different things other than the COVID vaccine," Troup says.Presented with the list, the employees who had requested religious exemptions still declined the vaccines. So Troup informed them they'd have to undergo regular COVID-19 testing. With 95% of his workforce vaccinated, he felt it was a reasonable accommodation."I feel like we've accomplished our goal to protect our staff, our patients and our community," he says. "We want to respect people's religious freedoms and their ability to make these decisions to the point that we can."But already, there are employers who have been less accommodating.The NBA has announced the following:pic.twitter.com/6t1spKMU35The NBA recently denied a religious exemption request from Golden State Warriors forward Andrew Wiggins, announcing that the athlete will not be able to play at any home games in San Francisco, which has a vaccine mandate for large indoor events, until he fulfills the city's vaccination requirements.United Airlines has granted religious exemptions to a small number of employees, but the reasonable accommodation the airline has provided isto put the employees on indefinite unpaid leavewithout regular benefits. A handful of United employees have sued, saying unpaid leave is not a reasonable accommodation but rather an adverse employment action.Román Hernández, a labor and employment attorney with Troutman Pepper in Portland, Ore., says historically, courts have upheld unpaid leave as a reasonable accommodation in religious exemption cases."It's probably not the accommodation that those workers wanted, but that is something that the employer is providing," Hernández says.Remember that under the law, employers must provide reasonable accommodations to workers seeking religious exemptions — unless doing so poses an undue hardship.It's important to look at how the EEOC defines undue hardship.In religious exemption cases, undue hardshipis defined as "more than ade minimis," or minimal,cost or burden on the operation of the employer's business. Hernández points out that an accommodation that involves shift changes could constitute more than a minimal burden to an employer, allowing the employer to deny such an accommodation.In its defense, United has argued that allowing unvaccinated employees to continue working in customer-facing roles on-site "would impose extraordinary — not justde minimis —costs on United and the public." The airline says it would have to implement a coronavirus testing program at more than 100 domestic airports and offices. Running such a program would cause a heavier workload for vaccinated co-workers — and United notes that 97% of its employees are now vaccinated.Vaccination is a simple way of promoting the common good and caring for each other, especially the most vulnerable.https://t.co/j9prRxvpoiProbably not, because religious exemptions ultimately come down to an employee's personal belief and whether an employer can find a reasonable accommodation.So far, no major religion has come out in opposition to the COVID-19 vaccines. In fact, prominentreligious leadersare endorsing them.Pope Francishas told Catholics that getting vaccinated is "an act of love," for example.Even the Christian Science Church, which counsels prayer rather than medical care, says it doesn't have an official policy on vaccinations. It leaves it up to individuals to make that decision.Mentions of religious mandates on social media and traditional media outlets have jumped ninefold since June, with most of that spike coming after the White House announced vaccine mandates for federal employees in early September, according to an analysis by media tracking firm Zignal Labs.In Facebook groups opposed to vaccine mandates, members frequently ask about how to obtain a religious exemption and what to say when petitioning their employers.In these groups, members regularly cite misleading claims that vaccines contain fetal cells. Others share links to online churches and self-described "consultants" offering signed exemption letters. One company offering these services charges $175 for phone consultations, research, sample forms and a signed letter from a pastor.But keep in mind, the employer really has a lot of discretion in granting these exemptions whether or not you have one of these signed letters. So people should probably think twice about paying for these services.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
The Associated PressJapanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga speaks to reporters about lifting of a state of emergency at his official residence in Tokyo Monday, Sept. 27. Suga announced Tuesday a lifting of the ongoing coronavirus state of emergency and less-stringent measures in all 27 prefectures including Tokyo when they expire at the end of September.APhide captionJapanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga speaks to reporters about lifting of a state of emergency at his official residence in Tokyo Monday, Sept. 27. Suga announced Tuesday a lifting of the ongoing coronavirus state of emergency and less-stringent measures in all 27 prefectures including Tokyo when they expire at the end of September.TOKYO — Japan's government says the coronavirus state of emergency will end Thursday so the economy can be reactivated as infections slow.Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga announced Tuesday that virus restrictions will be eased gradually.With the lifting, Japan will be entirely free of emergency requirements for the first time in more than six months. Government officials are preparing for the relaxed restrictions by instituting other plans such as vaccine passports and virus tests.Japan's current state of emergency, declared in April, was repeatedly extended and expanded. Despite public weariness and frustration over the measures, Japan has managed to avoid the more restrictive lockdowns imposed elsewhere while recording about 1.69 million cases and 17,500 deaths from COVID-19.The emergency and other measures in all 27 prefectures expire at the end of September. Some experts want the state of emergency in 19 areas to be eased to a quasi-emergency first to ensure infections don't quickly rebound, and the government is reportedly considering the strategy.The emergency has mainly been in the form of requests for restaurants and bars to open for shorter hours and not serve alcohol. Governors in Osaka, Hyogo and Kyoto have said they plan to keep those requests in place while closely monitoring the virus situations.Japan is eager to expand social and economic activities while balancing the need to prevent the next wave of infections. The government, which is in transition as the governing party chooses a replacement for Suga later this week, is under pressure to maintain effective virus strategies ahead of parliamentary elections in two months.Economy and Fiscal Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura, also in charge of COVID-19 measures, said easing of the measures will will gradual as cooler weather raises concern about a resurgence.Eateries and other commercial establishments currently required to close early should return to normal hours gradually while the authorities reinforce health care systems to prepare for the next outbreak, officials said."Lifting of the emergency doesn't mean we are 100% free," Dr. Shigeru Omi, top medical adviser for the government, told reporters. "The government should send a clear message to the people that we can only relax gradually."He urged the authorities to quickly tighten controls when there are early signs of resurgence ahead of holiday periods.Japan's ongoing and fifth state of emergency declared in April was repeatedly extended and expanded, turning into the longest since the pandemic began last year. Despite public weariness and frustration over the measures, Japan has managed to avoid the more restrictive lockdowns imposed elsewhere while recording about 1.69 million cases of infection and 17,500 deaths from COVID-19.Infections started to worsen in July and peaked in mid-August after the Olympics, surging above 5,000 cases in Tokyo alone and topping 25,000 nationwide. Thousands of patients unable to find hospital beds had to ride out the illness at home.Olympics and government officials deny the games directly caused the upsurge, but experts said the festive atmosphere made people more socially active and it was indirectly responsible.Suga decided to step down from party leadership and the premiership after facing criticism over his government's virus measures and his insistence on holding the Olympics during a pandemic despite public opposition.Daily reported cases have fallen to around 2,000 nationwide — less than one-tenth of the mid-August peak. Experts attributed the declining numbers to the progress of vaccinations — 56% of the population is fully vaccinated — and to people increasing their social distancing efforts after being alarmed by the collapse of medical systems.Vaccinations minister Taro Kono recently said Japan is also preparing to start administering boosters — a third shot for those who have already received two — to medial personnel by the end of this year and to elderly people early next year.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
The Associated PressMichelle Chester, director of employee health services at Northwell Health, prepares the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine at Long Island Jewish Valley Stream hospital. Hospitals and nursing homes across the country are preparing for worsening staff shortages as state deadlines arrive for employees to get vaccinated against COVID-19.Eduardo Munoz/APhide captionMichelle Chester, director of employee health services at Northwell Health, prepares the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine at Long Island Jewish Valley Stream hospital. Hospitals and nursing homes across the country are preparing for worsening staff shortages as state deadlines arrive for employees to get vaccinated against COVID-19.Hospitals and nursing homes around the U.S. are bracing forworsening staff shortagesas state deadlines arrive for health care workers to get vaccinated against COVID-19.With ultimatums taking effect this week in states includingNew York,California, Rhode Island and Connecticut, the fear is that some employees will quit or let themselves be fired or suspended rather than get the vaccine."How this is going to play out, we don't know. We are concerned about how it will exacerbate an already quite serious staffing problem," said California Hospital Association spokesperson Jan Emerson-Shea, adding that the organization "absolutely" supports the state's vaccination requirement.New York health care employees had until the end of the day Monday to get at least one dose, but some hospitals had already begun suspending or otherwise taking action against holdouts.Erie County Medical Center Corp. in Buffalo said about 5% of its hospital workforce has been put on unpaid leave for not being vaccinated, along with 20% of staff at its nursing home. And the state's largest health care provider, Northwell Health, said it has begun removing unvaccinated workers from its system, though it said its workforce is nearly 100% vaccinated."To those who have not yet made that decision, please do the right thing," New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said.Some New York hospitals prepared contingency plans that included cutting back on noncritical services and limiting nursing home admissions. The governor also drew up plans to summon help from National Guard members with medical training, retirees or vaccinated workers from outside the state.About a dozen states have vaccination mandates covering health care workers in hospitals, long-term care facilities or both. Some allow exemptions on medical or religious grounds, but those employees often must submit to regular COVID-19 testing.States that have set such requirements tend to have high vaccination rates already. The highest rates are concentrated in the Northeast, the lowest ones in the South and Midwest.The Biden administration also will require the roughly 17 million workers at health facilities that receive federal Medicare or Medicaid to be fully vaccinated under a rule still being developed.That has worried some hospital officials, particularly in rural communities where vaccination rates tend to be lower."We are looking at the need to reallocate staff, in some cases just to maintain services that are essential, and there are going to be some delays" in care, said Troy Bruntz, president and CEO at Community Hospital in McCook, Nebraska.He said 25 of the hospital's 330 employees said they would definitely resign if they were required to be vaccinated. The remainder of the approximately 100 unvaccinated employees — a group that includes nurses as well as cleaning and maintenance staff — haven't decided.He also worries that it will be difficult to hire new workers when the hospital is already short-handed."It doesn't make us feel too confident that this isn't going to turn into something short of a nightmare for American health care," he said.Many hospitals and nursing homes are already suffering staff shortages because many nurses and others have quit as a result of pandemic-related burnout or have left for lucrative jobs traveling from state to state.White House press secretary Jen Psaki noted that hospitals in Houston and Maine lost a relatively small number of employees recently after requiring employees to get vaccinated."We're seeing in a lot of places that this is working, it's effective. It's creating more certainty and protection in their workforces," Psaki said.In California, where health care workers have until Thursday to get fully vaccinated, some hospitals are anticipating firings, suspensions or the moving of people to other positions, Emerson-Shea said. She said many traveling nurses have declined assignments in California because of the state's vaccine requirement.But with a statewide mandate, health workers won't be able to just quit their jobs and go to other hospitals, said Dr. Jeff Smith, CEO and executive vice president of hospital operations at Los Angeles-based Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.He expects that about 97 percent of Cedars-Sinai's almost 17,000 employees affected by the vaccine mandate will comply by the deadline. Another 1 percent have applied for medical or religious exemptions. Those who don't comply by Friday will be suspended for a week, and fired on Oct. 8 if they don't comply or if there are not extenuating circumstances, he said.The hospital also was able to hire over 100 nurses in the past month and uses some travel nurses."We're in a good place but don't want to minimize the challenges other hospitals are likely facing," Smith said.In Rhode Island, where the vaccine mandate takes effect Friday, the state said hospitals can allow unvaccinated employees to keep working 30 days past the deadline in cases where firing them would compromise patient safety. The mandate is being challenged in court because it doesn't allow religious exemptions.In states that don't have mandates, some hospitals are imposing their own.Ginger Robertson, a registered nurse who works in a mental health clinic at a hospital in Bismarck, North Dakota, has requested a religious exemption from her hospital's vaccination requirement. She said she will look for other work if she doesn't get it."Honestly, I really love my job. I am good at it. I enjoy my patients. I enjoy where I am at," she said. "So this is a really hard place, to have to choose between two things I don't want to do. I don't want to leave, and I don't want to get the vaccine."She said other nurses are also considering leaving over what she called the "insulting" mandate."We feel demoralized, like as though we aren't intelligent enough to make these choices for ourselves," Robertson said.A North Carolina-based hospital system announced Monday that more than 175 of its 35,000-plus employees have been fired for failing to comply with its COVID-19 vaccination requirement.Last week, Novant Health announced 375 workers had been suspended and given five days to comply. Nearly 200 of them did so — including those who submitted approved exemptions — before the Friday deadline, spokesperson Megan Rivers said.Massachusetts' mandate, issued by Republican Gov. Charlie Baker, applies only to rest homes, assisted living facilities, hospice programs and home care programs. It allows for medical and religious exemptions but doesn't require regular testing. The deadline is Oct. 31.In Connecticut, a vaccine mandate for employees of state-run hospitals took effect on Monday. It does not apply to privately run hospitals, some of which are imposing their own requirements. Medical and religious exemptions are possible, but anyone else who fails to get vaccinated will be barred from the workplace.About 84% of over 450,000 hospital workers in New York were fully vaccinated as of Wednesday, according to state data. Nursing home data through Sunday showed about 89% of nursing home workers fully vaccinated.New York City's hospital system reported a 95% vaccination rate for nurses and a higher rate for doctors.In Missouri, which became a severe COVID-19 hot spot over the summer, the Mercy hospital system is requiring vaccinations among staff at its hundreds of medical centers and clinics in Missouri and neighboring states by Thursday.Anyone who doesn't comply by then will be placed on a 30-day unpaid suspension, said Mercy spokeswoman Bethany Pope.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Ben GilesFromA spokesperson for Arizona Republican Gov. Doug Ducey called the decision "the result of a rogue judge interfering with the authority and processes of another branch of government."Ross D. Franklin/APhide captionA spokesperson for Arizona Republican Gov. Doug Ducey called the decision "the result of a rogue judge interfering with the authority and processes of another branch of government."An Arizona judge ruled that a ban on public school mask mandates, as well as a variety of other laws shoehorned into the state budget by Republican lawmakers,is unconstitutional.The ruling frees public school leaders across Arizona to require students, staff and visitors to wear masks on campus. The law banning that authority was scheduled to take effect on Wednesday.A host of other policies adopted as part of the budget are also voided, including a ban on vaccine requirements for public universities, community colleges and local governments, anti-fraud measures for ballots and a ban on teaching critical race theory in public schools.All of it, Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Katherine Cooper wrote, is unconstitutional and unenforceable."The issue here is not what the Legislature decided but how it decided what it did," she wrote.Cooper cited two rules in the Arizona Constitution to support her ruling. One states that a bill can only tackle one thing, or one single subject, at a time. When it comes to the budget, the subject is clearly supposed to be how to spend taxpayer dollars, Cooper wrote. Another constitutional rule requires bills to be given a title that accurately reflects the content of the bill.In four budget bills, Republican state lawmakers violated at least one, or in one case, both of those rules, Cooper wrote.That one case included what Cooper described as an "array of provisions are in no way related to nor connected with one another or to an identifiable 'budget procedure.' "The 55-page Senate bill included policies that stripped the Democratic secretary of state of the authority to defend, or choose not to defend, Arizona election law; a broad preemption of local COVID-19 mitigation requirements for private businesses; a special committee to receive reports from a widely criticized, GOP-led review of the 2020 election in Maricopa County; and time limits on a governor's declaration of a public health emergency."The bill is classic logrolling – a medley of special interests cobbled together to force a vote for all or none," Cooper wrote.She rejected arguments from the state's attorney, who said the legislature has broad authority to interpret what policies fit under the title of a bill and what qualifies as the "single subject" a bill can deal with.Through a spokesman, Republican Gov. Doug Ducey called the decision "an example of judicial overreach.""Arizona's state government operates with three branches, and it's the duty and authority of only the legislative branch to organize itself and to make laws," spokesman CJ Karamargin said. "Unfortunately, today's decision is the result of a rogue judge interfering with the authority and processes of another branch of government."In a statement, Republican Attorney General Mark Brnovich said he'll appeal the ruling.Cooper addressed claims of overreach in her ruling, noting that she didn't address the policies Republicans sought to enact, but whether lawmakers followed constitutional mandates when writing and voting on those laws — an issue the courts have a history of determining, she wrote.The state school superintendent, Kathy Hoffman, a Democrat, praised the ruling as a welcome harbinger of change to the legislative process in Arizona, where Republican legislators routinely leverage their votes for the budget in exchange for something in return — in this case, substantive policy changes that Cooper ruled have no businesses being included in the budget.Hoffman described the Republican standard operating procedure as "an assault on the democratic process" and urged the state to let the ruling stand."While some will likely want to challenge today's ruling, our school communities are tired of being political pawns in dangerous attempts to subvert democracy and ignore science," Hoffman said.The ruling may also impact Ducey's efforts to discourage Arizona public school leaders from requiring students and staff to wear masks.In August, he announced grants to boost per-pupil funding in public and charter schools, but only for schools that make masks optional and keep classrooms open for in-person learning. Ducey is also offering families who want to opt out of school mask mandates vouchers to cover private school tuition. Those programs are funded by federal COVID-19 relief funds.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
The Associated PressNEW YORK — The nation's largest school district can immediately impose a vaccine mandate on its teachers and other workers, after all, a federal appeals panel decided Monday.The three-judge panel of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan issued a brief order late in the day that lifted a block of the mandate that asingle appeals judgehad put in place on Friday.After an adverse ruling from a Brooklyn judge, a group of teachers had brought the case to the appeals court, which assigned a three-judge panel to hear oral arguments Wednesday. But the appeals panel issued its order Monday after written arguments were submitted by both sides.Mayor Bill de Blasio announced in August that about 148,000 school employees would have to get at least a first dose of the COVID-19 vaccination by Sept. 27. The policy covers teachers, along with other staffers, such as custodians and cafeteria workers.As of Friday, 82% of department employees have been vaccinated, including 88% of teachers.But lawyers for teachers argued Monday in papers submitted to the 2nd Circuit that teachers who are placed on unpaid leave because they have not complied with the order will be irreparably harmed if the appeals court failed to block the mandate.The lawyers wrote that the city's order will "leave teachers and paraprofessionals without the resources to pay rent, utilities, and other essentials. The harm is imminent."On Sunday, the city submitted written arguments to the appeals court, saying the preference by some teachers "to remain unvaccinated while teaching vulnerable schoolchildren is dwarfed by the public's interest in safely resuming full school operations for a million public school students and ensuring that caregivers citywide can send their children to school secure in the knowledge that sound safety protocols are in place."Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

Hostin and Navarro, along with Joy Behar and Sara Haines, were tested multiple times over the weekend and all results were negative, the show said."It really was uncomfortable for my results to be released publicly before I even knew what was going on," Hostin said on Monday.She said her husband, a doctor, had to be pulled out of surgery as a precautionary measure when the news became known, and her children were taken out of school. All are safe, she said."I was flabbergasted," Navarro said.After the two were taken off the air, the show had to kill time, with Behar and Haines engaging in a question-and-answer session with audience members until the remote interview with Harris was set up."That led to some really awkward television that I'd like to have back if I could," said "The View" executive producer Brian Teta, who apologized on the air to Hostin and Navarro on Monday.Hostin said she is fully vaccinated, so she was convinced she would likely be fine even if the test were positive.Navarro also lashed back at Donald Trump Jr. for a Friday tweet in which the former president's son wrote, "Given the Ana Navarro news, I think it's time for a national conversation about the dangers of Covid-19 & obesity.""If you wanted to have a conversation about COVID and obesity, you could have had it last October," Navarro said, in reference to President Donald Trump's bout with the disease.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

Hospital and nursing home workers across New York are required to have at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine by Monday, prompting concerns over noncompliance and potential staffing shortages.New York state officials are bracing for staffing shortages when the state's health care worker vaccination mandate takes effect on Monday, and could be looking to the National Guard — as well as medical professionals from other states and countries — to help address them.Gov. Kathy Hochulreleased a planon Saturday, outlining the steps she could take to increase the workforce in the event that large numbers of hospital and nursing home employees do not meet the state's deadline."We are still in a battle against COVID to protect our loved ones, and we need to fight with every tool at our disposal," she said.That could mean declaring a state of emergency to allow health care professionals licensed outside of New York, as well as recent graduates and retirees, to practice there. Other options include deploying medically trained National Guard members, partnering with the federal government to send Disaster Medical Assistance Teams to local health and medical systems and "exploring ways to expedite visa requests for medical professionals."The state's labor department has also issued guidance clarifying that workers who are terminated because they refuse to be vaccinated will not be eligible for unemployment insurance, "absent a valid doctor-approved request for medical accommodation."All health care workers at New York's hospitals and nursing homes are required to have at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine by Monday, according to state regulationsand a mandateissued by former Gov. Andrew Cuomo last month. Staff at other institutions including home care, hospice and adult care facilities must be vaccinated by Oct. 7.Themost recent numberssuggest the state still has a ways to go: As of Wednesday, 84% of all hospital employees were fully vaccinated. And 81% of staff at all adult care facilities and 77% of nursing home facility staff were fully vaccinated as of Thursday.Health care systems statewide and nationally arealready struggling with staffing shortages.Critics of the requirement have challenged it throughprotests and lawsuits, as North Country Public Radio reports, opposing mandatory vaccination and challenging the lack of exemptions for religious objections.At this point, health care workers have the option to apply for a religious exemption until at least Oct.12, when a federal judge will consider a legal challenge in favor of such exemptions.As hospitals readied their contingency plans — which for many includes limiting certain procedures — late last week, Hochul held firm to the deadline. Shetold reporters on Thursdaythat there are "no excuses" for workers refusing to get vaccinated, and called the impending shortages "completely avoidable."Hospital systems and nursing homes across the state are encouraging their employees to get vaccinated, and preparing for disruptions if they do not. Some are cutting back on elective surgeries, limiting admissions and retaining volunteers.Northwell Health, the state's largest health care provider, has been holding meetings with staffers in an effort to persuade "thousands of holdouts,"The Associated Press reports. Some 90% of its 74,000 active personnel had been vaccinated as of Thursday, though the hospital said it's not expecting full compliance and has more than 3,000 retirees, students and volunteers on standby.Erie County Medical Center Corporation in Buffalo anticipates that roughly 10% of its workforce (some 400 workers) may not get vaccinated by Monday, according to AP, and is prepared to potentially suspend elective inpatient surgeries, reduce hours at outpatient clinics and temporarily stop accepting ICU transfers.As NPR has reported, Lewis County General Hospital in Lowville, N.Y., said it wouldpause maternity servicesstarting this weekend because dozens of staff members quit rather than get vaccinated.Unvaccinated employees of New York City's 11 public hospitals (which cites a roughly 88% compliance rate) will be put on unpaid leave but could return to work if they get vaccinated soon,CNN reports.Some hospital systems are seeing an increase in vaccination rates. New York-Presbyterian, for example, enacted its own mandate with a deadline of midnight on Wednesday, and reported that only about 250 of its 48,000 staffers did not comply.The University of Rochester Medical Centersaid in a statementthat 99% of professional medical staff and 91% of all employees across its six hospitals were partially or fully vaccinated as of last week.Dr. Michael Apostolakos, its chief medical officer, said that critical care and many-critical services will continue uninterrupted — but staffing shortages unrelated to the mandate are prompting a pause in some services.Patients will see longer wait times for routine appointments, some employees will be asked to take on additional responsibilities and beds could be temporarily closed, Apostolakos said in a statement.New York isnot the only placemandating vaccinations for health care workers — California announced a similar policy over the summer, and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs is also requiring front-line health care workers to get vaccinated.President Biden announcedearlier this monththat the 17 million health care workers at facilities that receive Medicare or Medicaid funding will have to be vaccinated or regularly tested, with details to be finalized in the weeks ahead.While such workplace requirements have the support of many public health experts — andmore than half of nurses, according to one recent survey —some politiciansand hospital officials have expressed concern. And that'sespecially true in rural areas, where vaccination rates are low and hiring is already difficult.Chiquita Brooks-LaSure, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services,told NPRthat the Biden administration is pursuing a mandate because of how stagnant vaccination rates are in the country's hospitals. She noted that while many hospitals are worried about staffing shortages, employees missing work because of illness or quarantine is an issue of both staffing too — and safety."It's very clear from the data that staff who remain unvaccinated are affecting both the patients who are coming in to the facilities as well as their colleagues," she said.It remains to be seen how severe staffing shortages will be, in New York and elsewhere. Though one state has already enacted a health care worker vaccination mandate, and could serve as one data point.Maine's governor announced a mandate for health care workers in mid-August, and hospitals areonly reporting a handfulof resignations so far — though enforcement doesn't start until Oct. 29.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

Now he's its CEO, and he's worried his hospital may have to stop delivering babies.That's because some of the experienced nurses in the Goodall-Witcher obstetrics department aren't vaccinated for COVID-19 and don't intend to be. But under a new federal mandate, hospitals will soon have to require their staff to be vaccinated."They are also near retirement age and a few of them have already voiced that, 'I will just retire,' " Willmann said. "And then a couple other nurses said, 'Well, I'll just go work for my husband's construction company.' "We're kind of at that point where everybody that's willing to get it, got it.Adam Willmann, CEO, Goodall-Witcher HealthcareWillmann's situation is not unique. Rural health providers across the country are sounding alarms about the new mandate that will start as soon as next month. The Biden administration wants every person working in a health care setting — from hospitals to nursing homes to dialysis centers — to be fully vaccinated for COVID-19.But in rural areas where vaccination rates are low and hiring is already difficult, hospital directors are worried there could be staffing shortages that force them to turn patients away.Willmann has been pushing hard to get all of his 250 employees to take one of the COVID-19 vaccines, but staff vaccination has topped out at around 70%. That's well above the rate in the surrounding community, but still not enough."We're kind of at that point where everybody that's willing to get it, got it," he said.In 2020, signs illustrated the best defenses against COVID-19: the proper way to cough and hand-washing. Now there is a stronger defense — the vaccine — but not everyone is on board with it.Dylan Hollingsworth/Bloomberg via Getty Imageshide captionIn 2020, signs illustrated the best defenses against COVID-19: the proper way to cough and hand-washing. Now there is a stronger defense — the vaccine — but not everyone is on board with it.That stagnation of vaccination rates in medical facilities all over the country is what drove the Biden administration to go for a mandate, said Chiquita Brooks-LaSure, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services."We did not undertake this decision lightly," Brooks-LaSure said in an interview with NPR.The agency is expected to finalize details of the new requirement over the next month. It plans to withhold Medicare and Medicaid funding from facilities unless they follow the mandate.Brooks-LaSure said she knows some hospitals and nursing homes, especially in rural areas, are worried the vaccine mandate will cause staffing shortages. But she said health care workers who aren't vaccinated and become sick or have to quarantine also cause staffing shortages.The government is also concerned about safety. "It's very clear from the data that staff who remain unvaccinated are affecting both the patients who are coming in to the facilities as well as their colleagues," Brooks-LaSure said.Brooks-LaSure said staffing issues may not end up being as severe as some fear. She pointed to the experience inMaine, where Gov. Janet Mills already put a state mandate in place for health care workers."Even though there was a lot of noise around what these mandates mean, the actual number of health care workers who quit was very limited," Brooks-LaSure said.#RIGHTNOW: More than 100 people are gathered on Portland’s Western Prom near Maine Medical Center to protest the Mills administration’s vaccine mandate for healthcare workers.@newscentermainepic.twitter.com/Tlgi7QUVgXIn New Hampshire's rural Coös County, Tom Mee has been working through the issues of putting a mandate in place. He's the CEO of North Country Healthcare, which decided to require vaccines for people who work at its three hospitals after the Food and Drug Administration gave its full approval to the Pfizer vaccine.Staff have 60 days to get the shot. "Our D-Day is Oct. 23, and one way or another, our workforce will be 100% compliant with the vaccine," Mee said.Mee said the decision was the right thing to do to protect the health of patients and employees. But it has been difficult to implement. He has received hate mail. But the mandate is working: A month ago, 78% of staff were vaccinated, but now it's up to 90%.But, he said, it's inevitable that the mandate will mean a handful of employees will quit or are forced to leave, gaps he expects to be able to fill by shifting staff around."It's a scene that you're going to see repeated throughout the United States," said Mee. "I've been in health care for 34 years, and I've never seen anything like this before."Connecticut National Guard medic Todd Smith administers a COVID-19 shot at a mass vaccination site in East Hartford, Conn.

Rural hospitals suspect they may need help from federal agencies like the Guard if the vaccine mandate causes staff to leave.In many regions, there's not a deep bench of qualified people to fill vacant health care jobs, especially during a pandemic, said Alan Morgan, CEO of the National Rural Health Association.Morgan is urging the Biden administration to come up with a plan to help with expected staff shortages once the mandate goes into effect, similar to the federal strike teams sent in to communities struggling to handle surges of COVID-19 cases that overwhelm local medical resources.Morgan suggested that teams could be drawn from the U.S. Public Health Service, the National Guard or the Federal Emergency Management Agency to help rural hospitals.Rural hospitals and clinics may be able to hire temporary relief nurses to come to their communities and use federal funding to help offset the expense, Morgan said. But city hospitals typically offer more attractive pay. Morgan also worries about a gap between the time the mandates take effect and the time a new tranche of federal funding becomes available.“There will be service disruptions, and there are multiple measures available to respond to them, but it appears that no one has taken the time to think this through yet at the federal level.”⁦@NRHA_Advocacy⁩ ⁦@ruralhealth⁩#covid#ruralhttps://t.co/Z9UY9RMQ03Morgan has been asking administration officials, hoping for some signal that contingency planning is underway and so far hasn't gotten a reassuring response.He is concerned that even small numbers could create outsized problems for rural hospitals. "Even if it would impact only 2% to 5% of the hospital staff, that's going to create a service disruption," Morgan said."Are we going to have to transfer existing patients? Are we going to have to put a halt on incoming patients?"Leanne Montenegro, 21, covers her eyes as she receives a COVID-19 vaccine at a FEMA vaccination center in Miami in the spring.

The company recently reintroduced limits on toilet paper, cleaning supplies and other products as it copes with supply chain challenges.The days oftoilet paper shortagesmay not be over just yet: Costco has announced new limits on purchases of certain household items as supply chain issues bedevil the company and the delta variant spreads.The company is putting "limitations on key items" such as toilet paper, bottled water and cleaning supplies so it can meet any uptick in demand due to the COVID-19 surge, Costco Chief Financial Officer Richard Galanti said during the company's latest earnings call on Thursday.He did not specify how many items customers would be allowed to buy."A year ago there was a shortage of merchandise," Galanti told investors during the call.Now Galanti said the retailer has plenty of merchandise, but delivery delays are the issue, citing "short-term changes to trucking" and "delivery need" as the main factors.In the meantime, Galanti said Costco is trying to stay ahead of the curve by continuing to place orders early to get stores what they need.In an effort to address the delivery issues, Galanti told investors that the company has chartered three ocean vessels for the next year to transport several thousand containers between the U.S., Asia and Canada. Each ship will be able to carry 800 to 1,000 containers at a time.The membership-only warehouse retailer said it has seen an increase in overall price inflation on its products this quarter, estimated to be between 3.5% and 4.5%, Galanti said.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

The two were pulled live from the TV show on Friday, just before Vice President Harris was scheduled to join them onstage for an interview.Two hosts of the popular ABC daytime talk showThe Viewtested positive for the coronavirus moments before Vice President Harris was set to appear onstage in what the network had touted as her first in-studio talk show interview since taking office.Sunny Hostin and Ana Navarro, both of whom are vaccinated against COVID-19, were dramatically called away by a show staffer just before Harris was to join them onstage. The two remaining co-hosts, Joy Behar and Sara Haines, ultimately interviewed Harris virtually while the vice president was stationed elsewhere in the studio."Sunny and Ana are strong women, and I know they're fine," Harris said of the two sidelined hosts, "but it really also does speak to the fact that they're vaccinated and vaccines really make all the difference, because otherwise we would be concerned about hospitalization and worse."After news of the hosts' infection settled, the interview shifted to the administration'streatment of Haitian asylum-seekersat the U.S.-Mexico border. Recent images of Border Patrol agents on horseback violently interacting with Haitian refugees have sent shock waves through the Democratic Party and have raised the question of how the Biden White House will differentiate itself from the Trump administration's intentionally harsh immigration practices."There needs to be consequence and accountability. Human beings should not be treated that way," Harris said, evoking the memory of the nation's historical treatment of Indigenous Americans and Black people.But the vice president couched her response as to whether the administration would halt alldeportation effortsagainst Haitian refugees, calling on the U.S. to "do more" in terms of supporting Haiti's recovery rather than calling for a blanket pause on deportations."The United States has to help and we have to do more, and our administration feels strongly about that," Harris said.Earlier in the day, President Bidenrebuked the actionsof the Border Patrol agents and said that he, as president, was responsible for the humanitarian crisis."Of course I take responsibility. I'm president," Biden said, calling the images from the border of agents on horseback using reins to corral Haitian migrants "outrageous.""Those people will pay," Biden said, noting that an investigation is ongoing."It's dangerous. It's wrong," he said. "It's simply not who we are."The pair's renunciations of the border chaos come after Daniel Foote, the U.S. special envoy for Haiti, this weekhanded in his resignationto Secretary of State Antony Blinken, saying he "will not be associated with the United States' inhumane, counterproductive decision to deport thousands of Haitian refugees and illegal immigrants to Haiti" from the U.S. border.In his letter, Foote wrote that his recommendations "have been ignored and dismissed" and that Haitians shouldn't be sent back to "a country where American officials are confined to secure compounds because of the danger posed by armed gangs in control of daily life."An investigation into law enforcement actions toward Haitians at the border is ongoing.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

On Thursday government advisers recommended booster doses of Pfizer's vaccine for millions of older or otherwise vulnerable Americans — despite doubts the extra shots will do much to slow the pandemic.Ted S. Warren/APhide captionIn this Jan. 8, 2021, file photo, a pharmacist prepares a syringe of the Pfizer vaccine for COVID-19, at Queen Anne Healthcare in Seattle. On Thursday government advisers recommended booster doses of Pfizer's vaccine for millions of older or otherwise vulnerable Americans — despite doubts the extra shots will do much to slow the pandemic.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Thursday endorsed booster shots for millions of older or otherwise vulnerable Americans, opening a major new phase in the U.S vaccination drive against COVID-19.CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky signed off on a series of recommendations from a panel of advisers late Thursday. The advisers said boosters should be offered to people 65 and older, nursing home residents and those ages 50 to 64 who have risky underlying health problems. The extra dose would be given once they are at least six months past their last Pfizer shot.However, Walensky decided to make one recommendation that the panel had rejected.The panel on Thursday voted against saying that people can get a booster if they are ages 18 to 64 years and are health-care workers or have another job that puts them at increased risk of being exposed to the virus.But Walensky disagreed and put that recommendation back in, noting that such a move aligns with an FDA booster authorization decision earlier this week. The category she included covers people who live in institutional settings that increase their risk of exposure, such as prisons or homeless shelters, as well as health care workers.The panel had offered the option of a booster for those ages 18 to 49 who have chronic health problems and want one. But the advisers refused to go further and open boosters to otherwise healthy front-line health care workers who aren't at risk of severe illness but want to avoid even a mild infection.The panel voted 9 to 6 to reject that proposal. But Walensky decided to disregard the advisory committee's counsel on that issue. In a decision several hours after the panel adjourned, Walensky issued a statement saying she had restored the recommendation."As CDC Director, it is my job to recognize where our actions can have the greatest impact," Walensky said in a statement late Thursday night. "At CDC, we are tasked with analyzing complex, often imperfect data to make concrete recommendations that optimize health. In a pandemic, even with uncertainty, we must take actions that we anticipate will do the greatest good."Experts say getting the unvaccinated their first shots remains the top priority, and the panel wrestled with whether the booster debate was distracting from that goal.All three of the COVID-19 vaccines used in the U.S. are still highly protective against severe illness, hospitalization and death, even with the spread of the extra-contagious delta variant. But only about 182 million Americans are fully vaccinated, or just 55% of the population."We can give boosters to people, but that's not really the answer to this pandemic," said Dr. Helen Keipp Talbot of Vanderbilt University. "Hospitals are full because people are not vaccinated. We are declining care to people who deserve care because we are full of unvaccinated COVID-positive patients."Thursday's decision represented a dramatic scaling back of the Biden administration plan announced last month to dispense boosters to nearly everyone to shore up their protection. Late Wednesday, the Food and Drug Administration, like the CDC panel, signed off on Pfizer boosters for a much narrower slice of the population than the White House envisioned.The booster plan marks an important shift in the nation's vaccination drive. Britain and Israel are already giving a third round of shots over strong objections from the World Health Organization that poor countries don't have enough for their initial doses.Walensky opened Thursday's meeting by stressing that vaccinating the unvaccinated remains the top goal "here in America and around the world."Walensky acknowledged that the data on who really needs a booster right away "are not perfect." "Yet collectively they form a picture for us," she said, "and they are what we have in this moment to make a decision about the next stage in this pandemic."The CDC panel stressed that its recommendations will be changed if new evidence shows more people need a booster.The CDC advisers expressed concern over the millions of Americans who received Moderna or Johnson & Johnson shots early in the vaccine rollout. The government still hasn't considered boosters for those brands and has no data on whether it is safe or effective to mix-and-match and give those people a Pfizer shot."I just don't understand how later this afternoon we can say to people 65 and older, 'You're at risk for severe illness and death, but only half of you can protect yourselves right now,'" said Dr. Sarah Long of Drexel University.About 26 million Americans got their last Pfizer dose at least six months ago, about half of whom are 65 or older. It's not clear how many more would meet the CDC panel's booster qualifications.CDC data show the vaccines still offer strong protection against serious illness for all ages, but there is a slight drop among the oldest adults. And immunity against milder infection appears to be waning months after people's initial immunization.For most people, if you're not in a group recommended for a booster, "it's really because we think you're well-protected," said Dr. Matthew Daley of Kaiser Permanente Colorado.Public health experts not involved in Thursday's decision said it is unlikely people seeking third doses at a drugstore or other site will be required to prove they qualify.Even with the introduction of boosters, someone who has gotten just the first two doses would still be considered fully vaccinated, according to the CDC's Dr. Kathleen Dooling. That is an important question to people in parts of the country where you need to show proof of vaccination to eat in a restaurant or enter other places of business.Among people who stand to benefit from a booster, there are few risks, the CDC concluded. Serious side effects from the first two Pfizer doses are exceedingly rare, including heart inflammation that sometimes occurs in younger men. Data from Israel, which has given nearly 3 million people — mostly 60 and older — a third Pfizer dose, has uncovered no red flags.The U.S. has already authorized third doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines for certain people with weakened immune systems, such as cancer patients and transplant recipients. Other Americans, healthy or not, have managed to get boosters, in some cases simply by asking.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
The Associated PressMedical personnel adjust their personal protective equipment while working in the emergency department at NYC Health + Hospitals Metropolitan in New York.John Minchillo/APhide captionMedical personnel adjust their personal protective equipment while working in the emergency department at NYC Health + Hospitals Metropolitan in New York.NEW YORK (AP) — Hospitals and nursing homes in New York are bracing for the possibility that a statewide COVID-19 vaccine mandate for health care workers could lead to staff shortages when it takes effect Monday.Doctors and nurses — and also support staff, like food service workers and cleaners — have been given until Sept. 27 to get at least their first vaccine shot in one of the nation's most aggressive plans to protect patients.With just days left to go before the deadline, many still hadn't. That left the prospect of potentially thousands of health care workers being forced off the job next week.With no sign of Gov. Kathy Hochul backing down, hospitals and nursing homes were preparing contingency plans that included cutting back on elective surgeries and, at one hospital, halting maternity services. Nursing homes were limiting admissions. The state's largest health care provider, Northwell Health, was keeping thousands of volunteers on standby."We would like to see some more time to be able to comply and implement the vaccine mandate, because at the end of the day it's a situation where we're very concerned about our ability to care for the patients," said Tom Quatroche, CEO of the Erie County Medical Center Corporation, which operates a busy 573-bed hospital in Buffalo.It anticipates that about 10% of its workforce, or 400 staff members, might still not be vaccinated by Monday. Under a contingency plan, the hospital said it would suspend elective inpatient surgeries, temporarily stop accepting ICU transfers from other institutions and reduce hours at outpatient clinics.Hochul, a Democrat, held firm on the deadline Thursday, telling reporters at a news conference that there were "no excuses" for those refusing to abide by the mandate, announced this summer."Every single person who is in your care has the right to know that there is no chance they will be infected by the person in charge of protecting them and their health," she said Thursday.New York is not the only state to require health care workers to get vaccinated. But it has been especially aggressive in pushing for wider vaccinations to help limit the spread of the virus in a place that was once the center of the ongoing global pandemic.Earlier this week, a judge refused to halt New York City's plan to require teachers in the country's largest public school system to get vaccinated, a mandate that is also to begin Monday.That looming deadline was also raising concerns about potentially thousands of teachers and school staff being suspended Monday.United Federation of Teachers President Michael Mulgrew on Thursday asked the city to delay the rule, saying "our schools are not ready."Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat, said he was confident holdouts would get the shot this weekend rather than face a loss of pay. And if not, he said, "we have thousands and thousands of vaccinated experienced substitute teachers ready to go."The mandate for health care workers comes as hospitals are already reeling from staff shortages due in part to rising demand, workers retiring and weary employees seeking other jobs after 18 months of the pandemic.There is one option for workers who don't want to get the shot, which is to apply for a religious exemption. That would buy them until at least Oct. 12, while a federal judge considers a legal challenge arguing that such exemptions are constitutionally required.With time ticking down on the health care mandate, Northwell Health was trying to persuade thousands of holdouts to get vaccinated, including individual meetings with staffers. The system's personnel chief, Maxine Carrington, said they're seeing a lot more appointments being scheduled."I've had personal conversations with team members, and I was asked by one: 'Are you really going to fire us on the 27th?' And I said, let's put that aside for a minute and let's talk about saving your life. Why don't you want to get vaccinated?" Carrington said.She said staff that refuse the inoculations will "no longer be qualified for employment."As of Thursday, about 90% of Northwell's 74,000 active personnel had been vaccinated. Still, the hospital system acknowledged that it did not expect full compliance and had more than 3,000 retirees, volunteers and health care students on standby, should they be needed Monday.The University of Rochester Medical Center, in the state's fourth largest city, announced a two-week pause in scheduling new elective procedures at its Strong Memorial Hospital beginning Monday. It also is temporarily closing two urgent care centers this week.One wild card is no one knows if a burst of health care workers will simply wait until the last minute to get a jab.One hopeful sign: New York-Presbyterian, one of the state's largest hospital systems, had imposed an earlier vaccination deadline on its workers — midnight Wednesday — and reported fewer than 250 of its 48,000 staffers had failed to comply.Spokesperson Alexandra Langan said in an email: "For those who chose not to comply, they will not continue to work at NYP."New York state has been averaging just under 5,000 new COVID-19 cases per day with around 2,300 people hospitalized. That's far worse than in late June, when around 300 people were testing positive each day statewide.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

During the pandemic, she has been struggling to afford fresh meat and fish.Gloria Hernandez, 82, says her greatest concern in the pandemic is making sure her two young grandsons are fed."Always feed the children," she says. "No matter how difficult life is, always feed the little ones. We adults can survive." When Gloria and her daughter get vegetables, fish or meat, they give it to the boys.Before COVID, Hernandez earned a living by selling bags of rice harvested by her children, who are farmers. But because their work in the fields has been disrupted by lockdowns, they have been giving her fewer bags.So Hernandez has taken on a variety of jobs to support herself and her household. Her 52-year-old daughter and her two grandsons, a 15-year-old student and a 22-year-old who works as an unpaid intern at the local municipal office, live with Hernandez and depend on her.She supplements her income by making and sellingwalis ting ting, brooms made with coconut fibers.

The Associated PressFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis, seen at a news conference last week. His newly appointed surgeon general on Wednesday signed protocols allowing parents to decide whether their children should quarantine or stay in school if they are asymptomatic after being exposed to someone who has tested positive for COVID-19.Wilfredo Lee/APhide captionFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis, seen at a news conference last week. His newly appointed surgeon general on Wednesday signed protocols allowing parents to decide whether their children should quarantine or stay in school if they are asymptomatic after being exposed to someone who has tested positive for COVID-19.ORLANDO, Fla. — A day after assuming his job, Florida'snewly appointed surgeon generalon Wednesday signed new protocols allowing parents to decide whether their children should quarantine or stay in school if they are asymptomatic after being exposed to someone who has tested positive for COVID-19.The new guidelines signed by Dr. Joseph Ladapo also tweaked the state's prohibition against school mask mandates, prompting an administrative law judge to dismiss a lawsuit against the old rule that had been filed by various school boards.In terms of quarantine rules, Ladapo eliminatedprevious mandatesrequiring students to quarantine for at least four days off-campus if they've been exposed. Under the new guidelines, students who have been exposed can continue going to campus, "without restrictions or disparate treatment," provided they are asymptomatic. They can also quarantine, but no longer than seven days, provided they do not get sick."Quarantining healthy students is incredibly damaging for their educational advancement," Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis said Wednesday at a news conference in Kissimmee. "It's also disruptive for families. We are going to be following a symptoms-based approach."The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says people who get infected can spread the virus starting from two days before they have any symptoms. The CDC recommends that a student should quarantine for 14 days if they are unvaccinated. They can shorten the quarantine to seven days by testing negative, according to the CDC.The president of a statewide teachers' union said school districts need all the tools necessary to keep children safe."Limiting districts' options and blocking them from following CDC guidelines is not in the best interest of the health of our students, employees or families," said Andrew Spar, president of the Florida Education Association.DeSantis named Ladapo to the job on Tuesday. Ladapo, who previously was a UCLA doctor and health policy researcher, shares the governor's approach to managing the coronavirus pandemic. Like DeSantis, Ladapo has said he doesn't believe in school closures, lockdowns or vaccine mandates.DeSantis' administration has opposed mask and vaccine mandates, fought local school boards over their efforts to require students to wear masks in schools and championed the use of monoclonal antibodies as a treatment for those who get sick with COVID-19.Unchanged from the earlier rules are requirements that students with the virus either quarantine for 10 days, receive a negative test and be asymptomatic before returning to campus or offer a doctor's note granting permission.As in the previous guidelines, schools can require masks as long as students can opt out, though the new rules add language that it's "at the parent or legal guardian's sole discretion."School officials in Alachua, Broward, Leon and Miami-Dade and Orange counties recently challenged the state's prohibition against mask mandates. But the Florida Department of Health argued that its new rule should lead to the dismissal of the lawsuit that targeted the old rule. An administrative law judge agreed Wednesday, saying no decision on the validity of the rule could be made since it had been repealed.Alachua County Public Schools Superintendent Dr. Carlee Simon called the Department of Health rule changes "disingenuous.""Essentially, the State is responding to the legal challenges of its rules by repealing them and creating new ones, with limited public notice," Simon said in a statement.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Scott HensleyRufus Peoples receives a dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine at a vaccination clinic in Southfield, Mich., in August.Emily Elconin/Getty Imageshide captionRufus Peoples receives a dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine at a vaccination clinic in Southfield, Mich., in August.The Food and Drug Administration authorized a booster dose Wednesday of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for people 65 and older and others at high risk of severe COVID-19.The FDA says the vaccine can also be given to people ages 18 to 64 whose jobs or institutional exposure to the coronavirus puts them at high risk of serious complications of COVID-19.A third shot of the vaccine can be given at least six months after completion of the two-dose regimen of the Pfizer vaccine,according to the authorization."After considering the totality of the available scientific evidence and the deliberations of our advisory committee of independent, external experts, the FDA amended the EUA for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine to allow for a booster dose in certain populations such as health care workers, teachers and day care staff, grocery workers and those in homeless shelters or prisons, among others," said the FDA's acting commissioner, Dr. Janet Woodcock, in a statement. "This pandemic is dynamic and evolving, with new data about vaccine safety and effectiveness becoming available every day. As we learn more about the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines, including the use of a booster dose, we will continue to evaluate the rapidly changing science and keep the public informed."The decision follows acontentious meeting on Friday of expertswho voted against broad FDA approval of a Pfizer booster for people 16 and older.The panel found the evidence of waning protection from the Pfizer vaccine to be clearest for older people. One factor that several panelists cited in their doubts about a broad approach to boosters right now was incomplete data on the risks of vaccination for younger people, especially myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart that is a rare side effect of the Pfizer vaccine.The expert panel's vote also supported the FDA authorizing a booster dose for people at high risk of severe disease, a group that includes health care workers exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus on the job and people with underlying health conditions."This first FDA authorization of a COVID-19 vaccine booster is a critical milestone in the ongoing fight against this disease," Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said in a statement. "We believe boosters have an important role to play in addressing the continued threat of this disease, alongside efforts to increase global access and uptake among the unvaccinated."A separate panel of advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is meeting to discuss COVID-19 boosters and to make specific recommendations about use of the Pfizer booster. A vote by that panel is expected Thursday afternoon. If the CDC signs off on the details of a booster, it could be rolled out to eligible people later this week.Modernasaid at the beginning of Septemberthat it has submitted initial data on its booster to the FDA. The company is developing a third dose that contains half the amount of mRNA, the genetic code that provokes an immune response, as the original shots. Clinical testing showed this booster, when given six months after the completion of initial immunization, prompted a strong antibody response to the coronavirus, including the delta variant.Johnson & Johnson, whose vaccine is given as one shot,said in Augustthat it has evidence that a booster shot prompts a strong immune response in people six months after their initial shot.On Tuesday, Johnson & Johnson released more information on use of a booster dose: Giving people a second shot two months after the first one boosted protection against moderate to severe disease from about 75% to as much as 100%.In addition, the company said waiting to give that second shot until six months after the first shot boosts antibody levels even more than giving it after two months — by 12-fold versus fourfold to sixfold. The results suggest that waiting longer for that second shot provides stronger protection.Johnson & Johnson said it has given the information to the FDA and plans to submit it to other regulators as well.Despite the FDA advisory committee's rejection of a broad booster rollout, some public health officials suggest that this could change. Dr. Anthony Fauci, chief medical adviser to the president, told NPR'sMorning Editionon Monday thathe expects more datato become available in the next few weeks that would "actually modify and expand the recommendation" for the use of boosters to more people. "But for now we'll go with what the FDA advisory committee has recommended," he added.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Scott NeumanA bald eagle perches on a tree at Sunset Park in Rock Island, Ill., in March. A new study says that many species of birds increasingly moved into urban areas as human activity waned during the pandemic.Joel Lerner/Xinhua News Agency/Getty Imageshide captionA bald eagle perches on a tree at Sunset Park in Rock Island, Ill., in March. A new study says that many species of birds increasingly moved into urban areas as human activity waned during the pandemic."Anthropause" is a word scientists have coined to describe the scaling back of human activity since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. While it's probably safe to say most people have found it uncomfortably restrictive, a new study published Wednesday suggests the pandemic has allowed many bird species to stretch their wings.As people remained indoors, stopped commuting to work or hopping on passenger jets, the birds increasingly flew into urban areas they had previously shunned, according to findings published inScience Advances.Michael Schrimpf, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Manitoba's Natural Resources Institute, and his colleagues used information gathered oneBird, the Cornell Lab of Ornithology's online database of detailed bird sightings reported by citizen scientists. They compared records of sightings of 82 bird species, a total of 4.3 million individual birds, in Canada and the United States from March through May 2020 — when many cities were in full coronavirus lockdown — with the same period for 2017 through 2019."Everything from birds like hawks and eagles all the way down to small songbirds and even hummingbirds," Schrimpf tells NPR.They found bird sightings increased near roads and airports during the pandemic. Overall, 80% of the bird species studied showed changes in their counts in urban areas in the 2020 time frame — with most of them increasing on the order of 10% to 20%."The actual physical environment didn't change," Schrimpf notes. "There were still buildings, there were still roads. You know, there weren't vast tracts of new forest in these urban areas."He says, "What did change was the activity of people in those spaces."Schrimpf explains that the results don't suggest greater numbers of actual birds, but that "the birds that people were seeing were basically birds that would have been in other places instead showed up in places that are more regularly trafficked by people."In fact, anestimatepublished in 2019 concluded that North America has lost about 3 billion birds since the 1970s, or nearly a third of all breeding birds.In the latest research, just over a quarter of the bird species studied showed mixed trends, with a few, such as house sparrows and the type of pigeon typically seen around cities, spotted less often in urban areas during the pandemic.Another caveat: It's possible that birds moved into some areas during the pandemic because they were relatively quiet and free from human activity. But as Schrimpf explains, "if a bird shows up there, but it didn't come along with, say, the right kind of food ... or if a predator like a coyote or a raccoon was also attracted to those areas because of lack of activity, what looks like a haven for a bird might wind up being a dangerous place."The trend noted in the latest study is not just for the birds, either. Apaperpublished last year inNaturenoted: "Anecdotal observations indicate that many animal species are enjoying the newly afforded peace and quiet, while others, surprisingly, seem to have come under increased pressure."It's difficult to say what will happen once the pandemic and the lockdowns are finally over, but Schrimpf says he is optimistic."We hope that it might be a lesson for us that we can take away in a post-pandemic world," he says, suggesting that people who prefer to continue working remotely might even use "helping the birds" as a rationale."I think that there is an opportunity to adjust how we live, to slow down," he says. "For example, if people could work from home, maybe not all the time, but you know, a couple of days a week, that could reduce our human activity."Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Jaclyn DiazBrazilian President Jair Bolsonaro pulls off his protective face mask to address the 76th session of the U.N. General Assembly at United Nations headquarters in New York on Tuesday.Eduardo Munoz/APhide captionBrazilian President Jair Bolsonaro pulls off his protective face mask to address the 76th session of the U.N. General Assembly at United Nations headquarters in New York on Tuesday.Upon taking the podium at the United Nations in New York City, the far-right leader of Brazil, President Jair Bolsonaro, remained defiant against his many critics."I came here to show a Brazil that is different from what is shown in the newspapers and on television," he told the chamber. "Brazil has changed — and a lot — since we assumed office in January 2019."The U.N. is working off ofan "honor system"— and that alone — to ensure that world leaders have been vaccinated before they speak at the annual gathering. Bolsonaro, who tested positive in July 2020, himself is unvaccinated and has made no secret of that. Yet, on Tuesday, he was allowed to go ahead with his speech in person.So far, his trip to New York City for the U.N. General Assembly appears to be anything but a success for Brazil, their leaders or the country's image after several blunders early this week.First, a member of Bolsonaro's team tested positive for COVID-19 as they arrived in New York City days before Brazil's delegation arrived for the meeting of world leaders.Then Brazilian health minister Marcelo Queiroga, who was vaccinated in March,shared that healso tested positive for COVID-19 just hours after accompanying Bolsonaro in New York.In his speech on Tuesday, Bolsonaro did not mention his own vaccination status and primarily focused on misinformation when he spoke about the coronavirus. He also pushed back on criticism of his government's dismal political and environmental record.A view of the COVID-19 intensive care unit in Rio De Janeiro on May 27.Fabio Teixeira/Anadolu Agency via Getty Imageshide captionA view of the COVID-19 intensive care unit in Rio De Janeiro on May 27.Throughout the pandemic, Brazil has frequently been one of the countries with the highest number of infections, second only to the U.S. for some time.According to Johns Hopkins University's global COVID-19 tracker, Brazil has suffered 591,440 deaths from the virus as of early Wednesday morning.Authorities there have dealt with low oxygen supplies, overcrowded hospitals and low vaccination rates. In June,a government inquiry exposedBolsonaro's mishandling of the coronavirus pandemic. It revealed that early on, his government failed to purchase or rejected offers to sell Brazil vaccines more than 14 times.But during Bolsonaro's speech to the U.N. this week, he went so far as to recommend unproven and ineffective coronavirus treatments."From the very beginning, in my country, I warned that we had two problems to solve, the virus and joblessness, and that both issues had to be addressed simultaneously and with the same sense of responsibility," he said.Bolsonaro saidthe Brazilian media had just "politicized" the virus and caused panic."Under the mottos 'stay at home' and 'we will deal with the economy later on,' they almost brought about social chaos to the country," he said. "But our administration in a bold step put in place several economic measures that prevented a greater evil."Bolsonaro said he didn't understand why many countries and the media rejected unproven and ineffective coronavirus treatments, saying that he had taken those drugs himself after becoming infected."History and science will know how to hold everyone to account," he added.Another of Bolsonaro's ministers shared a photo of the delegation eating a slice of pizza outside on the sidewalk of New York City.In a city often celebrated for its restaurants, it's unusual to find a world leader eating a slice on the go. But the unvaccinated Bolsonaro and his entourage will be limited in their dining options given the city's requirement that indoor diners be vaccinated.A United Nations employee cleans the microphones at the lectern after Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro, who has openly said he is not vaccinated against COVID-19, spoke to the U.N.

General Assembly on Tuesday.New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio on Monday put Bolsonaro on blast for attending the annual meeting."We need to send a message to all the world leaders, including most notably Bolsonaro from Brazil, that if you intend to come here, you need to be vaccinated," de Blasio said during a daily briefing.After the images of Bolsonaro and his delegation enjoying a sidewalk slice was shared on social media,de Blasio responded on Twitter, urging Bolsonaro to get vaccinated.There also remains a risk of a spread of the virus after, prior to his quarantining, Queiroga was filmed shaking hands with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Johnson on Tuesday met with President Biden at the White House.According to Brazilian journalist Raquel Krähenbühl, earlier that day, Queiroga was in the same van as Brazil's foreign minister who met with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken.Krähenbühlalso shared that Queiroga had stayed at the same hotel as Biden had.Even with last summer's decree banning fires in all Brazilian territory for 120 days, a fire brigade found itself battling flames in August on a farm near the city of Novo Progresso.Ernesto Carriço/NurPhoto via Getty Imageshide captionEven with last summer's decree banning fires in all Brazilian territory for 120 days, a fire brigade found itself battling flames in August on a farm near the city of Novo Progresso.Elsewhere in his address, Bolsonaro sought to boost the country's record on the environment."Which other country in the world has a policy of environmental protection like ours?" Bolsonaro asked.But under his leadership, there has been a spike in deforestation in the Amazon.Last year, the Brazilian Amazon lost an area14 times the size of New York City to deforestation. That's the most in 12 years. This is partly because Bolsonaro has weakened government environmental agencies combating illegal mining and logging.Portions of the Amazon rainforest are now releasing more carbon dioxide than they absorb.Marcio Astrini, the executive director of the Climate Observatory, an umbrella group of environmental NGOs,toldThe Guardianthis week that Bolsonaro had distorted statistics in an attempt to defend his environmental record."This is simply not true – it's a lie," Astrini said of Bolsonaro's claim that 84% of the Amazon rainforest was intact. "Somebody cooks up these numbers and the president repeats them."Astrini said the only thing that could lead to improvement in Brazil would be Bolsonaro resigning.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Rachana PradhanFromDr. Janet Woodcock, acting commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, appears before a Senate committee in July. Many public health leaders say letting the agency go so long without a permanent director has demoralized staff and sends the wrong message about the agency's importance.Stefani Reynolds/Pool/The New York Times via APhide captionDr. Janet Woodcock, acting commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, appears before a Senate committee in July. Many public health leaders say letting the agency go so long without a permanent director has demoralized staff and sends the wrong message about the agency's importance.President Biden's failure to name someone to lead the Food and Drug Administration, more than 10 months after the election, has flummoxed public health experts who say it's baffling for the agency to be without a permanent leader during a national health crisis.The pandemic has taxed the FDA, an 18,000-person agency whose chiefs have traditionally received bipartisan backing during the Senate confirmation process. Many leaders in public health, industry and consumer groups agree that Biden's foot-dragging on finding a new director has demoralized the staff and sent the wrong message about the agency's importance, even as the toll of COVID-19mounts, with a recent average of more than 130,000 new cases and 1,500 deaths daily, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.It's a tough job in normal times, observers say, and at the moment may be the worst top job in Washington. At the heart of the tension is finding a nominee who balances the agency's dual responsibilities of protecting public health while also working with the drug, medical device and other industries to approve products and treatments for market. Meanwhile, the agency has been mired in controversies related to approvals for drugs and COVID-19 vaccines; thediscord over decisionshas spilled into public view.FDA commissioner is a "particularly rough job in wartime," said Steven Grossman, executive director of the Alliance for a Stronger FDA, anoutside organizationconsisting of industry, research and other groups, which pushes for Congress to increase agency funding. "It is a much more difficult post to fill than it appears to the eye."Dr. Janet Woodcock, an agency veteran of more than three decades,has for months led as acting commissioner. She commands broad respect. But her perceived closeness to the pharmaceutical industry, particularly with respect to the agency's role in the opioid crisis, hasled some Senate Democratsto come out against her official assumption of the role. Biden would need all Democrats on board or some Republican senators to back his choice to get the votes for confirmation.In December, Bidenannounced other top health appointeeshe hoped would lead his pandemic response, including Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra, Surgeon General Vivek Murthy and CDC Director Rochelle Walensky. HHS oversees the FDA — as it does the office of the surgeon general, the CDC and the National Institutes of Health.But eight months after Biden's inauguration, there'sstill no sign of an FDA nomination. Biden officials reportedly considered multiple potential candidates throughout the spring, including Woodcock, former top FDA official and Maryland Health Secretary Joshua Sharfstein (who declined to comment for this story), former FDA official Michelle McMurry-Heath and Scripps Research Translational Institute Director Dr. Eric Topol (who confirmed to Kaiser Health News he wasn't interested). Then the process seemed to deadlock."People are just flabbergasted," says Dr. John Whyte, chief medical officer of WebMD and a former FDA official. "We don't even have rumors of viable candidates."Many of the agency's other critical responsibilities require sustained leadership even as the FDA urgently vets COVID-19 treatments, tests and vaccines, according to people in public health, the health care industry and consumer groups. The FDA oversees much of the nation's food supply and the regulation of tobacco products and reviews the use ofeverything from stents and catheters to cancer drugs.Long-term decisions on tobacco regulation can't wait, says Matthew Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, a consumer advocacy group that has been pushing the FDA to move quickly to implement a ban on menthol cigarettes (a ban the agencyannounced in April) and to decide which electronic cigarettes can stay on the market. This month the agencypunted on whether it would ban the sale of e-cigarettes from several major companies, including Juul, the largest maker of such products."What the FDA does over the next weeks or months with regard to e-cigarettes will determine whether we have a decades-long youth e-cigarette epidemic or whether we reverse it now," Myers says. "Waiting for a new commissioner is not an option."He and others conceded that, regardless of Woodcock'squalifications, any acting commissioner's ability to set priorities is diminished. That adds to anxiety about a leadership vacuum, even though few doubt her expertise."One significant disadvantage to being 'acting' is there is no time frame of how long that individual will be in that position," says Dr. Andrew von Eschenbach, FDA commissioner in the George W. Bush administration. As important work is executed, "there is no certainty" how long an acting leader is "going to be there" to see it through, von Eschenbach says. "That's an instability that is very, very difficult to deal with."For agency staffers, it stings to see other physicians in the Biden administration speak publicly on issues squarely in the agency's purview, says Stacy Cline Amin, a partner at law firm Morrison & Foerster and former chief counsel of the agency."It's been a morale hit for FDA," she says.Under federal law, Woodcock can serve as acting commissioner until mid-November unless Biden nominates a permanent commissioner, in which case she can remain until the Senate confirms that person."People are anxious," says Ellen Sigal, founder of the influential nonprofit Friends of Cancer Research, which receives funding from the pharmaceutical industry and supported Woodcock for the job. "Is it going to be someone that knows the agency? Is it going to be someone that people really respect and really want to work with?"The FDA is overwhelmingly run by career scientists whose jobs don't depend on who wins the White House. Any Senate-confirmed leader largely defers to the scientists who run FDA divisions to make decisions regarding products, according to former officials and others with knowledge of the agency's inner workings. For example, an FDA spokesperson says Woodcock was not involved in thecontroversial decision to approve Aduhelm, a costly Alzheimer's drugmanufactured by Biogen that some research neurologists and others say went to market despite little evidence it works.But in July,the lingering controversyled Woodcockto ask the HHS Office of Inspector Generalto "conduct an independent review and assessment of interactions between representatives of Biogen and FDA during the process that led to the approval of Aduhelm."A leader appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate has clout in setting priorities, hiring staff and making long-term decisions."The commissioner has obviously tremendous influence ... not on a product-by-product basis but what the philosophy is" related to the regulatory process, says Scott Whitaker, president and CEO of AdvaMed, which lobbies for the medical device industry. That philosophy expressed by the head of the agency "can impact how you think about developing products," he says.Others say Biden's speed in announcing a nominee is less important in the end than selecting the right person, a calculation that's especially fraught given the agency's recent controversies.Chief among them recentlywas thecriticism from several scientistsafter the Biden administrationannounced a plan in Augustfor widespread COVID-19 booster shots beginning the week of Sept. 20 — an announcement that came well before agency scientists had finished necessary reviews. Woodcock had signed on to an HHS statement announcing the plan, but some critics said the proposal came too far ahead of the science and unfairly jammed her staff.Two veteran FDA officials who have announced their retirements were part of an international group of scientists thatpublished an essay inThe Lancetquestioning whether the general public needs additional vaccine doses at this time.The FDA is expected this week to authorize booster shots for high-risk patients and those age 65 and older, following the recommendation Friday of an advisory panel to the agency. Thepanel overwhelmingly rejected the administration's initial planto offer extra shots more widely — for the general population — citing a need for additional research.The White House didn't respond to questions about why Biden hasn't nominated someone as FDA commissioner or set a timeline for doing so."If it takes a little longer to get the right person who's going to be more aligned in protecting public health and represent interests of the public, as opposed to the interest of industry, which is what the case has been for many years under Dr. Woodcock, then it may be worth the wait," says Dr. Michael Carome, director of the health research group at Public Citizen, a liberal advocacy group that opposed Woodcock's nomination. The FDA referred a request for comment to the White House, which didn't respond.Sigal sees the question of who should lead the FDA differently."FDA approves drugs, and they have to work with industry," she says. "The fact that you work with industry on drug development or on diagnostics with developers, or you work with people that are manufacturing food, with manufacturers or whatever — it's what the agency does."Kaiser Health Newsis a national, editorially independent newsroom and program of the Kaiser Family Foundation.

Rob SteinCarmel WrothThe pandemic appears to have peaked or be on the verge of peaking, with cases projected to slowly decline this fall and winter. As recently as Sept. 8, people were waiting at COVID-19 testing site in Kentucky, where over 4,000 new cases were confirmed that day.Jeffrey Dean/Bloomberg via Getty Imageshide captionThe pandemic appears to have peaked or be on the verge of peaking, with cases projected to slowly decline this fall and winter. As recently as Sept. 8, people were waiting at COVID-19 testing site in Kentucky, where over 4,000 new cases were confirmed that day.Americans may be able to breathe a tentative sigh of relief soon, according to researchers studying the trajectory of the pandemic.The delta surge appears to be peaking nationally, and cases and deaths will likely decline steadily now through the spring without a significant winter surge, according to a new analysis shared with NPR by a consortium of researchers advising the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Loading...For its latest update, which it released Wednesday, theCOVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hubcombined nine different mathematical models from different research groups to get an outlook for the pandemic for the next six months."Any of us who have been following this closely, given what happened with delta, are going to be really cautious about too much optimism," says Justin Lessler at the University of North Carolina, who helps run the hub. "But I do think that the trajectory is towards improvement for most of the country," he says.The modelers developed four potential scenarios, taking into account whether or not childhood vaccinations take off and whether a more infectious new variant should emerge.The most likely scenario, says Lessler, is that children do get vaccinated and no super-spreading variant emerges. In that case, the combo model forecasts that new infections would slowly, but fairly continuously, drop from about 140,000 today now to about 9,000 a day by March.Deaths from COVID-19 would fall from about 1,500 a day now to fewer than 100 a day by March 2022.That's around the level U.S. cases and deaths were in late March 2020 when the pandemic just started to flare up in the U.S. and better than things looked early this summer when many thought the pandemic was waning.Loading...And this scenario projects that there will be no winter surge, though Lessler cautions that there is uncertainty in the models and a "moderate" surge is still theoretically possible.There's wide range of uncertainty in the models, he notes, and it's plausible, though very unlikely, that cases could continue to rise to as many as 232,000 per day before starting to decline."We have to be cautious because the virus has shown us time and time again that new variants or people loosening up on how careful they're being can lead things to come roaring back," Lessler warns.William Hanage, an epidemiologist at Harvard's T.H. Chan School of Public Health, notes there is a fair amount of uncertainty in the models. "I would be concerned about interpreting these in an overly optimistic fashion for the country as a whole," he says.He agrees that overall the pandemic will be "comparatively under control by March," but says "there could be a number of bumps in the road."Last winter, the worst surge of the pandemic in the U.S. hit midwinter when weather was cold and more people spent time indoors. "If you look at the seasonal dynamics of coronaviruses, they usually peak in early January. And in fact, last year we saw a peak like that with SARS-CoV-2," he says.Both Hanage and Lessler note that there will be regional variation with some states continuing to surge for possibly a few weeks. Essentially, things could still get worse in some places before they get better.Lessler says he is especially worried about Pennsylvania, for example, and he notes that in some Western states like Idaho and Utah, there's a risk of resurgence. Hanage notes that places with cold winter weather may be susceptible to some increase in cases later in the year.And hospitals are going to continue to get flooded with patients for a while before infections taper off, and many are already being pushedpast the breaking point.Another caveat: This scenario assumes that the U.S. doesn't get hit with a new variant that's even more contagious than delta. If it does, a bleaker scenario from the Modeling Hub projects far worse numbers: just below 50,000 cases a day by next March. But Lessler emphasizes this is very hypothetical.He's hopeful that the most optimistic scenario is the most likely."I think a lot of people have been tending to think that with this surge, it just is never going to get better. And so maybe I just need to stop worrying about it and take risks. But I think these projections show us there is a light at the end of the tunnel," he says.Lessler thinks that at this point there's enough immunity in this country from a combination of enough people getting vaccinated and enough people having been exposed to the virus."The biggest driver is immunity," he explains. "We've seen really big delta waves. The virus has eaten up the susceptible people. So there are less people out there to infect." The virus is still fighting back, he says, but "immunity always wins out eventually."But transmission is still very high and will remain so for a while, so precautions are still called for until new infections come down to moderate levels.Natalie Dean, an assistant professor of biostatistics at Emory University, notes that even though we may see a decline this fall, we will still see "a lot of cases and deaths."Getting everyone who is eligible vaccinated is still key to preventing further deaths. Even in this optimistic scenario, the U.S. is projected to reach a cumulative total of more than 780,000 deaths by March.Modeling is an imprecise science, but the Modeling Hub brings together many of the the top disease modelers around the country, doing their best to look far down the road and make sense of a very unpredictable, complicated pandemic that's thrown one curve ball after another."I hope it's true, obviously, but I can't shake a little unease I have about what could be coming," says Dean.So like many Americans, Dean is keeping her fingers crossed.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

Hong/APhide captionLaura Sanchez got a COVID vaccine shot last month from nurse Noleen Nobleza in Orange, Calif.LOS ANGELES — California is seeing lower coronavirus transmission than other U.S. states as virus cases and hospitalizations for COVID-19 declinefollowing a summer surge.The state is currently the only one experiencing "substantial" coronavirus transmission, the second-highest level on the CDC's color-coded map. So is Puerto Rico.In all other U.S. states, virus transmission is rated as "high."State health experts say relativelyhigh vaccination ratesin California ahead of the arrival of the delta variant of the coronavirus made a difference. They say additional measures, such as masking, also helped stem the surge.State data say nearly 70% of eligible Californians are fully vaccinated.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Jaclyn DiazJohnson & Johnson shared data from the Phase 3 trial of its booster shot on Tuesday indicating a booster shot at six months provided a 12-fold increase in antibodies.Eva Marie Uzctegui/Bloomberg via Getty Imageshide captionJohnson & Johnson shared data from the Phase 3 trial of its booster shot on Tuesday indicating a booster shot at six months provided a 12-fold increase in antibodies.People who receive a Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine booster shot are better protected against the coronavirus for a longer period of time, according to the pharmaceutical company's latest trial results.The one-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccinehas been foundto be 66% protective against moderate and severe disease overall worldwide and 72% protective against such cases in the U.S. But when a person receives a booster shot two months after getting the pharmaceutical company's one-dose vaccine, the protection against COVID-19 increased to 94%.A booster shot at six months provided a 12-fold increase in antibodies.The companyhad previously shared earlier evidencefrom this trial that people who received its one-shot COVID-19 vaccine could benefit from a booster shot after six months. The information shared Tuesday was part of the company's Phase 3 trial."Our large real-world-evidence and Phase 3 studies confirm that the single-shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine provides strong and long-lasting protection against COVID-19-related hospitalizations. Additionally, our Phase 3 trial data further confirms protection against COVID-19 related death," said Mathai Mammen, global head of Janssen research and development for Johnson & Johnson, in a statement.Experts have said coronavirus boosters will be needed down the road because the efficacy of these vaccines, including the two-dose Pfizer and Moderna shots, wanes over time. Johnson & Johnson's trial data provides further support that a COVID-19 booster shot could go a long way in providing continued protection from the virus."Our single-shot vaccine generates strong immune responses and long-lasting immune memory. And, when a booster of the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine is given, the strength of protection against COVID-19 further increases," Mammen said.Pfizer's own data indicates booster shots canrestore its vaccine's efficacyto 95%. A third dose of the Moderna vaccine, given six months after the initial two doses, also significantly boosts immunity,according to the company's data.Despite President Biden's earlier announcement that the U.S. plans to get booster shots in the arms of already-vaccinated Americans, it's unclear when health officials would approve such a move for the general public.Health officials have already recommended a third shot of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccinefor a more limited population— people who are moderately to severely immunocompromised. But last week,the Food and Drug Administration recommended against approval of a booster doseof the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for people 16 years and older.That ruling didn't weigh in on a Johnson & Johnson booster shot, however.The company says it has provided available data to the FDA and plans to submit the data to other regulators, the World Health Organization and National Immunization Technical Advisory Groups worldwide to inform decision-making on vaccine administration strategies.Data from Johnson & Johnson's booster trial showed strong protection against severe COVID-19 infections soon after the second-dose was administered.At least 28 days after a patient received the second Johnson & Johnson shot, data showed at least 75% overall efficacy against severe or critical COVID-19 infections, across all age cohorts and all countries included in the study.Doses of the Johnson & Johnson Janssen COVID-19 vaccine.Elijah Nouvelage/Bloomberg via Getty Imageshide captionDoses of the Johnson & Johnson Janssen COVID-19 vaccine.Specifically for the U.S., the company reported a 74% efficacy against critical COVID-19 infections. The booster also provided 89% efficacy against hospitalization and 83% against COVID-19-related death.A booster shot after two months provided 94% efficacy against COVID-19 in the U.S. According to the company, as early as two weeks after the booster shot was administered data showed 100% efficacy against critical COVID-19 infections.When a booster of the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine was given six months after the single-shot dose, antibody levels increased nine-fold one week after the booster and continued to climb to 12-fold higher four weeks after the booster.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

He said last week that the state saw more deaths than births in 2020 for the first time in more than a century.In 2020, for the first time in recorded history, more people died in Alabama than were born in the state."Our state literally shrunk," Dr. Scott Harris,the state's top health official,said ata pressbriefinglast week.The state saw some 64,714 total deaths last year, Harris said, compared with about 57,641 births. Those numbers are preliminary, and officials will confirm them toward the end of this year.Alabama hasn't hit such a milestone in more than 100 years, not even during World War II, Harris noted.The coronavirus, which is spreading in Alabama as well as much of the country, is what's behind those numbers.The delta variant currently circulating is putting a strain on critical health care systems in Alabama, asthe state currently doesn't have enough ICU bedsfor those who need them.Still, some politicians there continue to push back on vaccines. Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall joined other GOP attorneys general last week inthreatening to sue the White House overitsrecent vaccine mandate plans.Some 41.3% ofAlabama's population is fully vaccinated, according to NPR's tracker. Harris said at the briefing that the state "continues to do a pretty good job" in that regard. Nationally,54.6% of the total U.S. population is fully vaccinated.And the 2020 milestone may not be unique for long. Alabama could see higher deaths than births again in 2021 if the state continues on its current grim trajectory.This story originally appeared ontheMorning Editionlive blog.An earlier version of this story incorrectly attributed the rise in deaths last year to the delta variant. In fact, it was the coronavirus more broadly; the delta variant began circulating widely in 2021.An earlier version of this story incorrectly attributed the rise in deaths last year to the delta variant.

De Marchi, who has sent many wooden works into the water, came up with the idea during last year's pandemic lockdown.The trademark gondolas of Venice's Grand Canal played second fiddle this weekend to a very unusual vessel: A giant violin carrying a live string quartet."Noah's Violin" is the most recent creation of Venetian artist Livio De Marchi. He's sent plenty of other wooden works out to sea,including a giant shoe and an origami hat.This large-scale replica is made from about a dozen different kinds of wood, with nuts, bolts and space for a motor inside, according to theThe New York Times.De Marchi, who came up with the idea during last year's lockdown, told the newspaper that the violin is a "sign of Venice restarting." He named it after Noah's ark because he sees it as bringing a message of hope — artistically and culturally — after a storm.The violin made its journey down the canal on Saturday, as musicians on board performed works by Vivaldi (De Marchi also cited the Venetian violinist and composer as a source of inspiration for the craft's design).After its roughly hour-long ride, the violin was blessed by a reverend, who said he hoped it would send a message of hope to the world.

Brian NaylorVaccinated travelers will be allowed to fly to the U.S. starting in early November.Lewis Joly/APhide captionVaccinated travelers will be allowed to fly to the U.S. starting in early November.The Biden administration is easing restrictions on foreign nationals wishing to fly to the United States.Starting in early November, they will be allowed to enter this country if they can show proof that they have been vaccinated for COVID-19 and that they have tested negatively for the virus within three days of their flight.Jeffrey Zients, President Biden's COVID-19 response coordinator, announced the new policy Monday. It replaces a patchwork oftravel bans on travelers, most of which began during the Trump administration.The travel bans, many in place for well over a year, separated families and negatively affected the tourism industry in the U.S., where international travel is a big part of business. A hashtag, #LoveIsNotTourism, took off on social media, with people advocating for an end to the travel bans, at least for those who are fully vaccinated.Zients said the Biden administration will be working with airlines in the coming weeks on how to best implement the new procedures. He said travelers will also have to provide their phone numbers and email addresses to allow for enhanced contact tracing.The new system, Zients said, "allows us to implement strict protocols to prevent the spread of COVID" from passengers flying to the United States.It does not apply to ground travel from Canada and Mexico.Unvaccinated Americans will be allowed to travel back to the U.S. but will have to show proof of a negative coronavirus test within one day of their flight.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Cory TurnerU.S. Education Secretary Miguel Cardona, pictured here in March, begins a back-to-school tour of the Midwest on Monday.Chris Kleponis/Bloomberg via Getty Imageshide captionU.S. Education Secretary Miguel Cardona, pictured here in March, begins a back-to-school tour of the Midwest on Monday.U.S. Education Secretary Miguel Cardona kickstarts his"Return-to-School Road Trip" this week, talking up the Biden administration's efforts to help children safely return to classrooms. The five-day bus tour begins early Monday with a pep rally at Locust Lane Elementary School in Eau Claire, Wisc."The best part of fall is welcoming students back for a new school year, and I'm thrilled to be traveling across the Midwest to celebrate the return to safe in-person learning," Cardona said in a release announcing the tour.Cardona is not the first education secretary to hit the road welcoming students back to school, but the stakes feel higher now. Children across the country are returning to classrooms, in some cases for the first time in more than a year, and with the delta variant of COVID-19 still ravaging many communities and no vaccine yet for kids younger than 12, many families feel as uncomfortable as ever with the idea of sending their kids to school.The data offer cause for both alarm and comfort. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics,as of Sept. 9, nearly 5.3 million children have tested positive for COVID-19 since the pandemic began, but nearly 500,000 of those cases have come in just the past two weeks, as kids returned to classrooms, sometimes with unmasked classmates. If there is good news in these numbers, it's that, according to the AAP, severe illness and hospitalization remain uncommon, and deaths are rarer still — just "0.00%-0.03[%] of all child COVID-19 cases."So Cardona's job is two-fold: to use his bully pulpit to push schools and, in some cases, state leaders to adopt the kinds of strong safety measures recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and to reassure anxious parents, caregivers and educators that, with those measures in place, kids can — and should — return to school."The return to school this year is more special than ever," Cardona said, "after many of our nation's students have been disconnected from their peers, educators, classrooms, school communities and learning routines for over a year."Each stop of the five-state, Midwestern tour will have its own theme. A Wednesday event in Kendallville, Ind., will focus on adult education and literacy while, in Lansing, Mich., Cardona will highlight the administration's efforts to improve access to early childhood education.At every stop, Cardona will almost certainly talk up the enormous infusion of federal funding schools have received since the pandemic began, including in the American Rescue Plan, which carried a roughly $122 billion lifeline to help schools pay for everything from improved ventilation and extra staffing to summer school and tutoring for children to recover some of the learning time they may have lost during the pandemic.Cardona's pitch will likely balance this kind of informed optimism with the occasional burst of political pugilism. Fights over masking and vaccinating students haveroiled many districts, and Biden's education secretary has repeatedly thrown punches in the name of public health.When several states banned schools from requiring that students wear masks, the secretary announced his departmentwould investigate themfor potentially violating the civil rights of students with disabilities. When Florida withheld the salaries of some school officials who defied the state's mask mandate ban, Cardonaunveiled a grantto cover the costs.The tour wraps up on Friday with a school visit in Canton, Mich., outside Detroit.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Jaclyn DiazA health worker administers a dose of a Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine during a vaccination clinic earlier this month at the Reading Area Community College in Reading, Pa.Matt Rourke/APhide captionA health worker administers a dose of a Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine during a vaccination clinic earlier this month at the Reading Area Community College in Reading, Pa.The first results from the highly anticipated trial studying the effectiveness and safety of the Pfizer and BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for children ages 5 to 11 showed promising results.The pharmaceutical companies said early results of their trial indicate the vaccine is safe for children and establishes a strong antibody response against the virus.Giving a two-dose regimen of 10 μg (micrograms) administered 21 days apart for children between 5 and 11 years old was well tolerated, according to Pfizer and BioNTech. Side effects were also generally comparable to those of people between the ages of 16 and 25 years old who received the vaccine.This trial used a smaller vaccine dosage, 10 micrograms, rather than the 30 microgram dose used for people 12 and older. The dosage was selected as the preferred dose for safety and effectiveness in young children.News of the results come as pediatric cases of COVID-19 are increasing amid a nationwide surge of infections."Since July, pediatric cases of COVID-19 have risen by about 240 percent in the U.S. — underscoring the public health need for vaccination. These trial results provide a strong foundation for seeking authorization of our vaccine for children 5 to 11 years old, and we plan to submit them to the FDA and other regulators with urgency," said Albert Bourla, the chairman and CEO for Pfizer."Over the past nine months, hundreds of millions of people ages 12 and older from around the world have received our COVID-19 vaccine. We are eager to extend the protection afforded by the vaccine to this younger population, subject to regulatory authorization, especially as we track the spread of the Delta variant and the substantial threat it poses to children," Bourla said in a statement.Despite the strong results, it will be some time before the general public can see an official rollout of vaccines for children ages 5 to 11. Once analysis of the trial is completed, Pfizer and BioNTech will submit the results "in the near term" to the Food and Drug Administration for review and possible emergency use authorization.And even if the FDA grants that authorization, Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, recently told NPR that parents and caregivers will likely have to wait until the end of 2021 before a COVID-19 vaccine is fully approved for young children ages 5 to 11.Trial results for children under 5 years of age could come later this year, the pharmaceutical companies said."Already in March 2021, we have started the study to evaluate the immunization of younger children. Our objective was to generate and submit the data for schoolkids to regulatory authorities around the world before the winter season begins," BioNTech CEO and co-founder Ugur Sahin said.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Pien HuangPeople opposed to COVID-19 vaccines often embrace ivermectin, a drug they think is not getting the attention it deserves.

Here, an anti-vaccination protester takes part in a rally against vaccine mandates last month in Santa Monica, Calif.Through July and August, Julie Smith watched her husband, Jeffrey, get worse and worse from COVID-19. In early July, the healthy outdoorsman, 51, had tested positive for the coronavirus. Within a week, he was admitted to the intensive care unit at a hospital near their home in the suburbs of Cincinnati.The hospital treated him with antiviral drugs, convalescent plasma and steroids, but he continued to decline. Weeks later he was on a ventilator in a medically induced coma — "on death's doorstep," Julie Smith wrote in a legal complaintfiled Aug. 20.Smith felt the hospital had given up on her husband, but she could not, according to the complaint. After doing research on the internet, she sued the hospital to require it to treat her husband with ivermectin — an inexpensive anti-parasitic drug that's been used to cure animals and people from worms and lice since the 1980s.U.S. health authoritiesand most doctors do not recommend using it to prevent or treat COVID-19, citing a lack of clear evidence on whether the drug works. Yet myths and beliefs around the drug have taken on a life of their own, fueled by a small group of doctors whose views diverge fromthe medical consensus, byright-wing commentatorsand byinternet groupswhere people share tips on sourcing and dosing.That people such as Smith and a handful of other families of COVID-19 patientsare turning to the courtsto enforce treatment with the drug shows how heated the debate over ivermectin has come to be in the United States."There's misinformation on both sides," says Jennifer Granston, head of insights atZignal Labs, a firm that conducts data analysis on internet trends. She cited inflated, unsubstantiated claims of both the drug's efficacy andits harms. "At the end of the day, does this medication help COVID patients or does it not? That's a scientific issue."How did a science question about the efficacy of an inexpensive, everyday drug become an inflamed public morality debate — where people on both sides believe the wrong position could cost lives? It's a tale that spans science and politics, pitting health officials against celebrities and communal responsibilities against individual rights.And it's a debate that public health experts worry could prolong the pandemic as individuals forgo vaccines and proven prevention measures and instead take up alternative treatments that may not be effective.Protesters for an anti-vaccine rally in Cincinnati in August carry a sign backing ivermectin. Belief in the drug's efficacy often goes hand in hand with vaccine hesitancy.Phil Didion/USA Today Network/Reutershide captionProtesters for an anti-vaccine rally in Cincinnati in August carry a sign backing ivermectin. Belief in the drug's efficacy often goes hand in hand with vaccine hesitancy.Advocates for ivermectin have called it a wonder drug — and it is, for treating parasites. In the 1970s, a team of researchers, headed by Kitasato Institute researcherSatoshi Omuraand the drug company Merck, discovered a set of powerful anti-parasitic compounds in bacteria from a dirt sample dug upfrom a seaside golf coursenear Tokyo.From that compound, Merck developed medicines that kill a wide range of parasites that plague animals and humans. Ivermectin, introduced in the early 1980s as a drug for livestock, becamea blockbuster, making more than $1 billion in sales a year. The version of the drug launched for human use cured disfiguring parasitic infections such aselephantiasisandriver blindnessin developing countries. (It eradicated the latterin several countries.)Omura and William Campbell, his counterpart at Merck, shareda Nobel Prizein 2015 for their discoveries related to the drug.Early in the pandemic, given its track record, it seemed worth trying against COVID-19. In June 2020, a group of Australian researcherspublished a papershowing that large quantities of ivermectin could stop the coronavirus from replicating in cell cultures."But pretty quickly, people realized the problem with that was something called 'pharmacokinetic mismatch,' " says Laurel Bristow, ascience communicatorandclinical research coordinatorat Emory University. The amount of ivermectin a person would need to take to achieve that effect isup to 100 timesthe dose approved for humans. At that concentration, the drug might stop the virus — and may also harm the patient, she says.The challenge for researchers has been to figure out whether a safe dosecouldbe effective, Bristow says. Numerous studies have been published, and a few large trials are still underway.Ivermectin research on COVID-19 published to date does not look promising, according to researchers who have closely considered the evidence."You have a large number of trials that have been done. Many of them are poorly done. They're too small, they're too short, they don't measure the right things," saysDr. Peter Lurie,president of theCenter for Science in the Public Interestand a former associate commissioner at the Food and Drug Administration.And at leasttwo influentialpreprints thatsupported the use of ivermectin were later retracted when they were found to contain flawed or fabricated data.Lurie and other health experts point to areview of the studieson ivermectin and COVID-19 published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, considered to bethe gold standardin assessing evidence on current medical topics. In reviewing the available research through May, the Cochrane researchers found "no evidence to support the use of ivermectin for treating or preventing COVID-19 infection," though they acknowledged the data is limited.Clinicians associated with a U.S. organization, the Front Line COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance, maintain there are dozens of studies that show a positive impact on COVID-19. But many of the studies they point to were omitted from the Cochrane analysis becausethe reviewers concludedtheir designs were faulty or drew on inaccurate comparisons."That doesn't preclude the notion that the next clinical trial, if properly conducted, will not be one that actually demonstrates effectiveness," Lurie says, "But at the moment, we can only work from what we currently know. And what we currently know is that there's insufficient evidence to recommend this product at this time."Large, rigorous clinical trials are underway — includingone in the U.K. run by Oxford University and anNational Institutes of Health-funded study in the U.S.led by researchers at Duke University with multiple sites around the country. Emory researcher Bristow is lead coordinator for one of the study sites."People keep acting like there's this huge censorship about ivermectin when really we're actively working on figuring it out," she says, "We're trying to evaluate the potential efficacy of ivermectin for preventing hospitalization and relieving symptoms faster."Even if research showed an advantage to ivermectin, that wouldn't make it a miracle COVID-19 cure, warnsAaron Friedberg, a primary care physician who supervises medical residents in the hospital at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center."Ultimately, when we're talking about things being 'effective,' we just mean it works, even some," he says, explaining that steroids are considered effective COVID-19 treatments in thatthey slightly increasethe chances of survival among people treated properly with them.Meanwhile, some people are overdosing on ivermectin. While the drug is generally considered to be safein doses approved for human use, many who are taking it as an unproven treatment for COVID-19 are using more than the typically prescribed amount, saysMichael Ganioof the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, or using concentrated formsmeant for livestock. And that hasprompted warningsfrom U.S. federal agencies.Bristow says the research community is devoting more time and resources to studying this drug, compared with other treatments, because of the immense interest around it. As was the case with hydroxychloroquine, though, she cautions that interest in the drug may be driven more by ideology than science.In May 2020, as the nation struggled to contain the coronavirus without a vaccine, then-President Donald Trump announced thathe was taking hydroxychloroquinein an attempt to ward off infection despitewarnings from the FDA. The idea that a cheap, widely available drug could end the pandemic provided an alternative solution for an administration struggling to contain the virus."It fits a political narrative, which is about reopening the economy as soon as possible," saysYunkang Yang, a disinformation researcher at George Washington University, who recentlyco-authored a book chapteron how right-wing media and the Trump administration worked together to push hydroxychloroquine. "The miracle cure paints a rosy picture of the situation. It is portrayed as a quick fix that is designed to persuade people to go back to work."A protester at a September rally to protest vaccination mandates in New York City carries a sign supporting ivermectin.Tayfun Coskun/Anadolu Agency via Getty Imageshide captionA protester at a September rally to protest vaccination mandates in New York City carries a sign supporting ivermectin.When COVID-19 vaccines arrived last winter, they relieved some of the pressure — but more Republicans were skeptical of the vaccines than Democrats,a divide that has only widenedover time.So the hunt for alternative cures continued to have political value. In December, Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., invited Pierre Kory, a critical care physician then affiliated with St. Luke's Aurora Medical Center in Milwaukee, to testify about ivermectinat a Senate committee hearing. Kory is a founding member and spokesperson for the Front Line COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance, a small group of doctors whose views on ivermectin diverge from the wider medical community.At the Senate hearing, he stated that the drug was "proving to be of miraculous impact" and claimed unequivocally that it has a prophylactic effect against COVID-19: "It basically obliterates transmission of this virus. If you take it, you will not get sick," he said.Kory's comments circulated widely on the internet but were not backed by solid scientific evidence available at thetime or since. YouTube later removed videos of the hearing from their platforms,deeming it "inappropriate content," but Kory's championing of ivermectin had already received more than 1 million views, according toan Associated Press report.The video's removal led to cries of censorship from the right, weaving a thread of conspiracy through the narrative for those who were looking for it.Soon right-wing media figures such asFox News host Laura Ingrahambegan touting the drug. Other influencers such as comedian Joe Rogan also amplified the reputation of ivermectin — Rogan promoted the drug on his popular podcast and later announced hetook it for COVID-19.For people inclined to be suspicious of government scientists and federal policies on issues such as mask-wearing, ivermectin filled the place of the failed hydroxychloroquine as an alternative to the official federal guidance on how to prevent and treat COVID-19."It fits into the bigger narrative about the so-called 'medical deep state' [in which] scientists, pharmaceutical and political elites have an interest in making people use more expensive, experimental drugs" to increase the profits of the pharmaceutical industry, Yang says. "And they have an interest in not showing the public the cheap, widely available drugs that can supposedly cure COVID-19." (Ingraham has labeledDr. Anthony Fauci as part of the "medical deep state.")Ivermectin is an effective treatment for certain parasites in humans and animals, but there's yet no clear evidence it helps treat COVID-19.Mike Stewart/APhide captionIvermectin is an effective treatment for certain parasites in humans and animals, but there's yet no clear evidence it helps treat COVID-19.Midway through the summer, the delta variantstarted to burnthrough the United States. Cases exploded in places with low vaccination rates. In hot spots across the South and Midwest, worried people sometimes turned to the internet for answers.Online mentions for ivermectin spiked: Seventy-four percent of the topic's mentions for this year have taken place in the past two months, with a huge increase in August, Zignal's analysis shows. "That's where we're really starting to see this story take off," Zignal's Granston says, "I'd also say that's when we really start to see the story split."Rhetoric on both sides heated up. TheCenters for Disease Control and Prevention,FDAand other public health agencies came out strongly against the use of the drug on the basis of the poor quality of evidence supporting it so far. Meanwhile, proponents of the "miracle cure" dug in, often citing the handful of medical experts affiliated with the Front Line COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance who defend it."Clear instances of disinformation are relatively easy to debunk," Granston says. "The really hard stuff is where you have conflicting information. This is a very personal issue for people, because you're talking about their health and everybody's really grasping for answers. And that is outpacing the public health officials' knowledge because the scientific studies haven't been conducted on a broad scale yet."While those studies are underway, some people's belief in ivermectin over other proven options, such as masks and vaccines, is giving them a false sense of security and control.In some cases, the misinformation is actually killing them, saysKolina Koltai, a researcher who studies vaccine dissent at the University of Washington. Koltai likens vaccine refusal to not wearing a seat belt in a car because you heard of someone who survived an accident without a seat belt."If someone thinks they're safe [because they're taking ivermectin], they're making a judgment that impacts not only their health but their community's health," she says, "by either use of resources at the hospital or [by getting and] spreading COVID. That is the real risk and danger of misinformation."The toll of COVID-19 on people who are unvaccinated has been harsh. By mid-September, as the delta variant continued to surge, hospitalizations were at their highest since early February; more than 1,800 people were dying ofCOVID-19 each day. Thevast majority of peoplewho have been hospitalized for or killed by the disease in recent months were not vaccinated.Smith and her husband were among those who chose to forgo vaccination. Smith said she considered the vaccine to be "experimental," according to a recording of a court hearing in the case shared with NPR byOhio Capital Journalreporter Jake Zuckerman. "We didn't feel confident that it had been out long enough," Smith testified, "and weren't sure of the damage that would ensue."Smith's husband spent weeks on a ventilator in the ICU of a hospital near Cincinnati.On Aug. 23, a judge issued an emergency order to the hospital to begin administering 30 milligrams of ivermectin a day to the patient, as prescribed by a Front Line COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance doctor. On Sept. 6, a different judgereversed the ruling."Everyone involved wants Jeff Smith to get better," Judge Michael Oster wrote in his decision. Still, after reviewing the evidence presented, the judge found "there can be no doubt that the medical and scientific communities do not support the use of ivermectin as a treatment for COVID-19."Doctors told the court that Jeffrey Smith's condition had not improved since receiving ivermectin. But Julie Smith believed it had.As of Sept. 18, Jeffrey Smith was still in the hospital on a ventilator, according to the couple's lawyer, Ralph Lorigo.The case mirrors the splintered conversations that are continuing to take place across the internet."It's the perfect storm right now of something that is going to become a lot more complex and a lot more challenging," Zignal's Granston says, "There's no clear side really winning out in this from what we can see."Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Sharon Pruitt-YoungA sign in August informs customers that they must show proof of vaccination against COVID-19 in order to dine indoors at Carmine's Italian restaurant in Manhattan.Ted Shaffrey/APhide captionA sign in August informs customers that they must show proof of vaccination against COVID-19 in order to dine indoors at Carmine's Italian restaurant in Manhattan.Three tourists were arrested after allegedly assaulting a restaurant host in Manhattan after she asked for proof of their vaccination status before they could be seated.Footage obtained byNBC New Yorkshows an intense scuffle outside Carmine's Italian restaurant on the Upper West Side on Thursday evening. The three tourists, who are from Texas, are alleged to have begun repeatedly punching the 22-year-old host after she asked them to show proof they were vaccinated against COVID-19 before entering the restaurant, in accordance with local regulations.The host had to be taken to the hospital after the attack, according to NBC New York. Police arrested three women — 21-year-old Tyonnie Keshay Rankin, 44-year-old Kaeita Nkeenge Rankin and 49-year-old Sally Rechelle Lewis  — and they have since been charged with misdemeanor assault and criminal mischief, according to a Gothamistreport. They are scheduled to appear in court on Oct. 5, the outlet reports.The attack happened just days after anexecutive orderwent into full effect requiring places of business like restaurants and movie theaters to check for proof of vaccination before allowing potential customers indoors, or else risk a $1,000 fine. Los Angeles County is slated to unveil similar rules for indoor bars and other recreational businesses next month, according toThe Associated Press.In a statement to NBC New York, a spokesperson for the restaurant said that "it's a shocking and tragic situation when one of our valued employees is assaulted for doing their job — as required by city policies — and trying to make a living."In response to the attack, the NYC Hospitality Alliance said in astatementthat it's calling for Mayor Bill de Blasio to implement greater penalties for those who assault restaurant workers and to raise awareness about the city's vaccine requirements.Violence against employees who are tasked with enforcing mask mandates and vaccination requirements has become a problem amid division about COVID-19 vaccines and coronavirus safety protocols. In 2021, officials have assessed more than amillion dollars in finesfor airline-passenger misconduct, and many of thoseincidentsinvolved unruly travelers who assaulted or otherwise harassed airline employees who were trying to enforce the federal mask mandate, the Federal Aviation Administration said last month.President Biden this monthcondemned violenceagainst airline employees and other workers, calling it "wrong" and "ugly."Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Scott HensleyA health care worker prepares third doses of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines for a senior living facility in Worcester, Pa., in late August.Hannah Beier/Bloomberg via Getty Imageshide captionA health care worker prepares third doses of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines for a senior living facility in Worcester, Pa., in late August.In a surprising vote, a panel of advisers to the Food and Drug Administration on Friday recommended against approval of a booster dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for people 16 years and older.The 16-2 vote against broad use of the booster, which would be given about six months after completion of the two-dose immunization regimen, dealt a setback to Pfizer and complicates the FDA's approach to boosters.After a brief intermission following the rejection, FDA officials returned to the meeting with a revised booster question. The panel then voted 18-0 in support of the agency authorizing a booster shot of the vaccine for people 65 and older or at high risk of severe COVID-19.The FDA then polled the panel members for advice on other groups of people who might be considered for a booster. Though not an official vote, the panel members unanimously supported authorization of a Pfizer booster dose for health care workers or others at high risk of occupational coronavirus exposure.The agency typically follows the advice of its advisory committees, though it isn't required to.The Biden administration said in August that itplanned to make booster shots availableduring the week of Sept. 20. That announcement was controversial because it came before the FDA had weighed Pfizer's application and before the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's own panel of experts on immunization practices could consider the need for boosters.The rise of the highly infectious delta variant of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus and some evidence that the Pfizer vaccine's protection against infections wanes with time are two of the factors that were cited in support of a booster.But presentations Friday generally showed that the vaccine is still effective in protecting immunized people against severe illness, hospitalization and death in the United States.Separately, however, ananalysis published Fridayin the CDC's "Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report" found that the Pfizer vaccine's protection against COVID-19 hospitalization dropped from 91% during the first 120 days after vaccination to 77% in the days after that.Over the course of the meeting, speakers from the FDA, Pfizer, the CDC, Israel and the U.K. presented data on the state of the coronavirus pandemic, experience with the Pfizer vaccine and lab tests.The most direct support for the Pfizer booster came from laboratory work and a clinical study done by Pfizer that involved a little over 300 people."The difficulty for the committee is that you're making incredibly important policy decisions very rapidly in a situation of uncertainty," said Jonathan Sterne, a statistician from the University of Bristol who made a presentation to the panel.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Rob SteinResearchers say all three authorized COVID vaccines are good at keeping people out of the hospital, but Moderna seems to have the longest-lasting protection.Frederic J. Brown/AFP via Getty Imageshide captionResearchers say all three authorized COVID vaccines are good at keeping people out of the hospital, but Moderna seems to have the longest-lasting protection.A head-to-head comparison of all three COVID-19 vaccines found Moderna is holding up better than Pfizer and the Johnson & Johnson vaccine provides the weakest protection.But the researchers stressed that all three vaccines are still providingstrong protectionagainst people getting so sick that they end up in the hospital.Researchers studied more than 3,000 people hospitalized between March and August. And found the Moderna vaccine was 93% effective at keeping people out the hospital and that protection appears to be holding steady.The Pfizer vaccine's protection fell from 91% effective to 77%. The Johnson and Johnson vaccine was 71% effective.The researchers speculated the Moderna vaccine may be the best because it uses a strong dose and spaced out the two shots a week longer.The FDA is weighing whether to approve abooster for the Pfizer vaccine.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Marc SilverIna Coronavirus FAQlast week, I reported on an encounter at an outdoor restaurant in which a stranger asked me why I was wearing a mask. "Do you think you really need it?" he wondered, even though he admitted that he was not yet fully vaccinated.I asked various public health experts what a good reply might be.Abraar Karan,  an infectious disease doctor at Stanford University, suggested I could have said: "When you have high rates of transmission of disease with high levels of spread, it makes sense to wear a mask. It can reduce the chance you'll get exposed to the virus or transmit it to others like kids or unvaccinated people."That "why do you wear a mask" question struck a chord with our readers. Thousands of them have been asked just that. They shared their real-life answerson FacebookandInstagram. Here's a sampling.If somebody asks, I tell them the truth. I have cancer, I'm currently on chemo, I have no immune system and I'm protecting myself not only from COVID but a whole bunch of other things, too. Shuts them right up.Two men have called me a sheep twice for wearing a mask. Since I was old enough to be both their grandmother, I asked them sweetly if I could have two minutes to explain. Both said yes. I think they both were ready for a fight, but they didn't get one. The first time it happened, after I got finished, the young man who asked why I was wearing a mask bought my gas for me. The second time, the young man in the pickup mumbled something along the lines of "I'm sorry" and couldn't get away from me fast enough. —Joyce RidnerMy 9-year-old son likes to answer: "Because I hate being sick." If we are around people without masks, we leave the situation. In an elevator I would get off and take the next one or take the stairs.We are at risk and my kids are too young to be vaccinated so they have figured out how to protect themselves. —Jennifer CrutcherSome guy came into the entrance of the grocery store and started shouting in people's faces, "Why are you wearing masks?" and asking us where it says in the Bible you have to wear a mask.A woman made the mistake of trying to speak to him reasonably. He started screaming in her face until [he was]escorted out of the store. There's no point in conversing with someone who is clearly looking to fight. —Melanie Zeien BeanI'm from a different generation. The one that had friends who got polio, smallpox, mumps and measles, for example. The one that had classmates in iron lungs. The generation that served in the military and got more than a dozen shots before getting sent somewhere nasty to do things unthinkable. So getting this vaccine and wearing a mask are trifles. —Tony LudlowWhat I have said when others ask why I am wearing a mask: 1) To respect you. 2) Out of an abundance of caution, as my husband has to work with intubated and end-of-life COVID patients in the ICU. 3) I've never had COVID, been exposed or ever had to be tested, so it seems to be working for me and my family. —Jill MelendezSponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

A number of lions and tigers at the Smithsonian's National Zoo in Washington, D.C., are now being treated for the virus.Six African lions, a Sumatran tiger and two Amur tigers have tested presumptive positive for the virus that causes COVID-19 and are undergoing treatment, the zoo said in anews releaseThursday.Zookeepers first noticed last week that the animals were displaying symptoms including decreased energy and appetite and coughing and sneezing. The animals are now being treated with anti-inflammatories, anti-nausea medication and antibiotics, the latter of which is intended to address a likely secondary bacterial pneumonia, the zoo said.The affected animals are not required to quarantine, and the public is not at risk due to the general lack of access zoo visitors have to animals in their enclosures, the zoo said.How the big cats contracted the virus is unclear. The zoo said its investigation did not yield answers as to how the virus may have spread to the animals, but it noted that all staff who may have had contact with the animals are required to wear a mask indoors.The Centers for Disease Control and Preventionhas saidthat it is possible for humans to transmit the virus to animals through close contact, but the risk of animals spreading the virus to humans is low.The National Zoo isn't the only facility dealing with sick animals. At Zoo Atlanta, 18 out of 20 western lowlandgorillas have contracted COVID-19, likely from an asymptomatic zoo worker. Like the big cats at the National Zoo, the gorillas displayed symptoms including decreased appetite and coughing.Zoos, however, arefighting back. Seventy zoos and other animal conservation sites have received donations of the COVID-19 vaccine to administer to some of their animals,The Washington Postreported.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Jonathan FranklinSylvia PoggioliPeople demonstrate against Italy's "green pass" on Saturday in Rome.Stefano Montesi/Corbis via Getty Imageshide captionPeople demonstrate against Italy's "green pass" on Saturday in Rome.In the fight to slow the spread of COVID-19 and to vaccinate its population, Italy is making COVID-19 health passes mandatory for all workers — becoming the first European country to do so.In a newly approved measure introduced Thursday by the Italian government, officials said digital vaccine certificates will be mandatory for all employees across the country.The health pass, or "green pass," details whether a person has been fully vaccinated, tested negative or has recently recovered from the virus. The passes are available in both digital and paper formats.From Oct. 15 through the end of the year, any worker failing to present their health vaccine certificate to their employer will be suspended without pay for up to five days but will not be fired.Health passes were originally introduced to ease traveling around Europe. However, Italy has made it a requirement to eat indoors at restaurants or visit museums and gyms."We are extending the obligation of the green pass to the entire world of work, public and private, and we are doing so for two essential reasons: to make these places safer and to make our vaccination campaign even stronger," Italy's health minister, Roberto Speranza, said in a news briefing, according toEuronews.Unemployed citizens and those living on pension will be exempt from showing their vaccine health pass, officials tell Euronews.News of Italy's mandatory requirement comes after the country reports more than 4.6 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 and over 130,000 deaths, according to recentdatafrom Johns Hopkins University.So far, 74% of Italians have at least one shot of the COVID-19 vaccine and 68% are fully vaccinated.Italy has the second-highest death toll from COVID-19 in Europe, with Britain reporting more than 130,000 deaths since the beginning of the pandemic.Earlier this month, Italy made the green pass a requirement for its teachers and other public workers, as health care workers were required to be vaccinated since March.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
David SchaperA plane lands at Los Angeles International Airport on Aug. 25. The airline industry hasn't come out against a government-imposed vaccine mandate for domestic travel, but the U.S. Travel Association, which represents a broader coalition of travel-dependent businesses, has.Mario Tama/Getty Imageshide captionA plane lands at Los Angeles International Airport on Aug. 25. The airline industry hasn't come out against a government-imposed vaccine mandate for domestic travel, but the U.S. Travel Association, which represents a broader coalition of travel-dependent businesses, has.A debate is heating up over whether President Biden'ssweeping vaccine mandateshould be extended to cover those who travel domestically by plane and train.The president's order last week requires that everyone from health care workers and federal government employees to those working at private companies with more than 100 employees be vaccinated against COVID-19 or be frequently tested for the coronavirus. The administration says the mandate will cover about 100 million Americans, but the president stopped short of requiring vaccination for those who travel.The recent big surge in new COVID-19 cases — including increases in deaths and serious illness requiring hospitalization — has led to aslowdown in air-travel demandin recent weeks, as even vaccinated travelers are increasingly concerned about the rapid spread of the highly contagious delta variant of the coronavirus.Kurt Ebenhoch is among them, admitting he was a little anxious while boarding a plane at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport on Wednesday, as fellow passengers lined up and crowded around, without social distancing."Well, it's frustrating and it's nerve-wracking," Ebenhoch told NPR by cellphone while scanning his boarding pass. "You do the best you can [to stay safe], and I'm vaccinated myself. I also am wearing a mask and comply with the mask rules. I bring along my own package of sanitizing wipes to wipe down the areas on the aircraft where I'll be making contact."But Ebenhoch, who is executive director of travel consumers group Travel Fairness Now, knows a lot of other would-be travelers are staying home because they're just not yet comfortable standing in long airport lines and squeezing into packed planes with those who may not be vaccinated."We have to look at what it's going to take to get people feeling confident that they have reliable health standards, no matter where they fly, no matter what airline they fly with," he says.The U.S. is becoming something of an outlier. Vaccines are required for air and train travel in Canada and between many countries in Europe, Asia and elsewhere. Americans traveling most places abroad must be vaccinated, but not to go from city to city and state to state within the United States.Rep. Don Beyer, D-Va., wants to change that."When everyone's immune, you don't have to worry about transmission or variants," Beyer says. "So the Safe Travel Act simply says this: When people want to travel by airplane or Amtrak, they either have to be vaccinated or they have to be tested 72 hours ahead of time."Beyer introduced his legislation because he thinks Biden's vaccine mandate just doesn't go far enough."What the president's done with the large employers, a hundred-plus, doesn't touch the travelers themselves," Beyer says. "You can still get an anti-vax traveler with a high virus load who can get on an airplane or a train and spread it to everyone else."Rep. Don Beyer, D-Va., shown here at a news conference this year, introduced the Safe Travel Act on Sept. 9 because he thinks President Biden's vaccine mandate doesn't go far enough.Kevin Dietsch/Getty Imageshide captionRep. Don Beyer, D-Va., shown here at a news conference this year, introduced the Safe Travel Act on Sept. 9 because he thinks President Biden's vaccine mandate doesn't go far enough.Many public health officials and infectious disease experts have been calling for a vaccine mandate for domestic travel for months, arguing it will help slow the spread of the coronavirus. And it's a position backed by the chief medical adviser to the president, Dr. Anthony Fauci."I would support that. If you want to get on a plane and travel, then you should be vaccinated," Fauci said in an interview on theSkimm Thispodcast.Fauci later clarified to say that the Biden administration is not extending its vaccine mandate to travel just yet, although it is under consideration.Airlines themselves could require passengers to be vaccinated, but Brett Snyder, who writes theCranky Flierairline industry blog, says one airline acting on its own could backfire, because of outspoken political opposition to vaccine mandates."If every airline goes along with it, then that's one thing," Snyder says. "But if they don't, then you're handing a fairly large portion of customers to one of your rivals."And that's something airlines may not be able to afford to do, with demand for air travel softening and customer cancellations of travel plans on the rise.United Airlines is one of just three carriers (Frontier and Hawaiian are the others) to require that its employees be vaccinated, but whenasked recently by NPR's Ailsa Chang onAll Things Consideredif the airline would mandate that passengers be vaccinated, CEO Scott Kirby said, "I think that mandating vaccines for passengers is really a government issue. For us to do that, we would probably require some sort of government directive."The airline industry hasn't come out against a government-imposed vaccine mandate for domestic travel, but the U.S. Travel Association, which represents a broader coalition of travel-dependent businesses, has."As far as the vaccine mandate, one, it's extraordinarily difficult to actually put in place," U.S. Travel President Roger Dow said at a news conference on Wednesday.Others in the industry say that implementation of a vaccine mandate would be logistically complex and cumbersome and that it raises questions about who would enforce the mandate — the airlines or the government?Even some of those working on efforts to increase vaccinations agree that a mandate for rail and air passengers faces some hurdles."In order to get to the point where we can require vaccinations, we need to have a system in place that provides people a reliable, valid way of verifying that they've been vaccinated, and we don't have that yet," says Leonard Marcus, who as co-director of Harvard University's National Preparedness Leadership Initiative, consults with the White House coronavirus task force.He and others note that paper vaccination cards can be easily forged and that many of the recently developed digital "vaccine passport" apps simply use photos of those cards.But interestingly, the airline industry and the U.S. Travel Association say they do support a vaccine mandate for international travel as a way to boost a segment of the industry that is especially lagging.And United's CEO, Kirby, suggested onAll Things Consideredthat implementing a vaccine mandate for travel wouldn't be too problematic."We have prepared ourselves with technology to be able to upload vaccine cards and track that and implement it if the government ever chooses to go in that direction," Kirby said.Harvard's Marcus says that Biden's vaccine mandate for workplaces is an important first step and that requiring vaccination for travel could be next."I think we're right now at a turning point in this country. I think there's a lot of impatience with the fact that this is lasting so long," Marcus says. "I think people are COVID fatigued and they're looking for bold, courageous leadership that will move us out of the crisis."If such an order doesn't come from the White House soon, Rep. Don Beyer and others hope Congress will take up his bill next month and vote to require vaccines for travel.A previous version of this story incorrectly identified Rep. Don Beyer as a Republican.

The Associated PressMedical professionals pronate a 39-year-old unvaccinated COVID-19 patient last month at St. Luke's Boise Medical Center in Boise, Idaho.Kyle Green/APhide captionMedical professionals pronate a 39-year-old unvaccinated COVID-19 patient last month at St. Luke's Boise Medical Center in Boise, Idaho.BOISE, Idaho (AP) — Idaho public health leaders on Thursday expanded health care rationing statewide amid a massive increase in the number of coronavirus patients requiring hospitalization.The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare made the announcement after St. Luke's Health System, Idaho's largest hospital network, on Wednesday asked state health leaders to allow "crisis standards of care" because the increase in COVID-19 patients has exhausted the state's medical resources.Idaho is one of the least vaccinated U.S. states, with only about 40% of its residents fully vaccinated against COVID-19. Only Wyoming and West Virginia have lower vaccination rates.Crisis care standards mean that scarce resources such as ICU beds will be allotted to the patients most likely to survive. Other patients will be treated with less effective methods or, in dire cases, given pain relief and other palliative care.Thursday's move came a week after Idaho officials started allowing health care rationing athospitals in northern parts of the state."The situation is dire – we don't have enough resources to adequately treat the patients in our hospitals, whether you are there for COVID-19 or a heart attack or because of a car accident," Idaho Department of Welfare Director Dave Jeppesen said in statement.He urged people to get vaccinated and wear masks indoors and in crowded outdoor settings."Our hospitals and healthcare systems need our help. The best way to end crisis standards of care is for more people to get vaccinated. It dramatically reduces your chances of having to go to the hospital if you do get sick from COVID-19," Jeppesen said.One in every 201 Idaho residents tested positive for COVID-19 over the past week, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. The mostly rural state ranks 12th in the U.S. for newly confirmed cases per capita. More than 1,300 new coronavirus cases were reported to the state on Wednesday, according to the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare.Hospitalizations have skyrocketed. On Monday, the most recent data available from the state showed that 678 people were hospitalized statewide with coronavirus.Meanwhile, the number of COVID-19 patients in intensive care unit beds has stayed mostly flat for the last two weeks at 70 people each day — suggesting the state may have reached the limit of its ability to treat ICU patients.Though all of the state's hospitals can now ration health care resources as needed, some might not need to take that step. Each hospital will decide how to implement the crisis standards of care in its own facility, public health officials said.Kootenai Health in the city of Coeur d'Alene was the first hospital in the state to officially enter crisis standards of care last week.At the time, Chief of Staff Dr. Robert Scoggins said some patients were being treated in a conference center that had been converted into a field hospital. Others received treatment in hallways or in converted emergency room lobbies. Urgent and elective surgeries are on hold across much of the state.On Wednesday, nearly 92% of all of the COVID-19 patients in St. Luke's hospitals were unvaccinated. Sixty one of the hospital's 78 ICU patients had COVID-19. St. Luke's physicians have pleaded with Idaho residents for months to get vaccinated and take steps to slow the spread of coronavirus, warning thathospitals beds were quickly running out.Public health officials have warned Idaho residents for weeks to take extra care to ensure they don't end up in hospitals. Last week, Jeppesen said residents should take their medications as prescribed, wear seatbelts and reconsider participating in any activities such as cycling that could lead to injuries.The health care crisis isn't just impacting hospitals — primary care physicians and medical equipment suppliers are also struggling to cope with the crush of coronavirus-related demand.One major medical supplier, Norco Medical, said demand for oxygen tanks and related equipment has increased, sometimes forcing the company to send patients home with fewer cylinders than they would normally provide. The company is also asking people to return unused or unneeded oxygen tanks so they will have enough on hand for the surge."There is a limit to everything, my leadership team and I were actually discussing this and we certainly all agreed that the word we'd like to use right now is that things are getting tight," Norco President Elias Margonis told Boise television station KTVB. "The concern is how much tighter will it get."Primary Health Medical Group, Idaho's largest independent primary care and urgent care system, late last month was forced to shorten operating hours because its waiting rooms were so packed with patients that staffers were staying hours past closing in order to see them all. Meanwhile, the company was dealing with higher-than-normal numbers of staffers out sick because they had been exposed to coronavirus in the community or had symptoms and were awaiting tests. Vaccination provides strong protection against becoming seriously ill with coronavirus, but the highly contagious delta variant can still cause "breakthrough" cases in vaccinated people.As case numbers continued to increase, some of Primary Health Medical Group's 21 clinics in southwestern Idaho have had to stop operating on weekends or close certain days of the week, said CEO Dr. David Peterman.Now the medical group is also preparing to monitor its patients who are released earlier than they normally would be from the hospital after emergencies, Peterman said."We will see more visits with patients that are avoiding the emergency room and patients who are sicker and need more care," Peterman said. "We are setting up a system right now to make sure over this weekend that we are immediately notified if one of our patients is discharged early from the hospital so we can make sure those patients are OK."Resources have been exhausted across the medical system, Peterman said."This is heart-wrenching.

By Oct. 16, health care workers must show they are fully vaccinated.Defending the decision to suspend those who did not meet the deadline, Véran said that "the continuity of care, the security of care and the quality of care were assured yesterday in all hospitals and health care facilities" in the country.Several dozen employees resigned rather than meet the vaccine requirement, he said.Despite the suspensions, "continued health care is assured," he said, noting that France has some 2.7 million health workers.Véran said that most of the suspensions were mainly support staff and only "very few nurses." He said most of them were "temporary."France's main health authority reported that by Sunday, nearly 90% of care workers in nursing homes for the elderly had received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, according toEuronews.In recent months, France has seen mass demonstrations turning out thousands of protesters who oppose the government's vaccine policies — including a "health pass" system introduced by President Emmanuel Macron — which they believe violate the rights of people who refuse to be inoculated.As many as 200,000 marched one weekend last month, and tens of thousands filled the streets for other weekend marches in some of France's largest cities, including Montpellier along the French Riviera, Bordeaux in the west and Strasbourg near the German border.Macron's health pass, which began to be introduced in July, would require anyone wanting to enter a restaurant, large shopping mall, theater or long-distance train to show proof of vaccination or a negative coronavirus test.This story was originally published in theMorning Editionlive blog.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

Secretary-General António Guterres (left) and Volkan Bozkir (right), president of the 75th session of the United Nations General Assembly, applaud as Abdulla Shahid (center) receives the gavel as the new president of the 76th session of the UNGA at U.N. headquarters.UNITED NATIONS — World leaders will have to be vaccinated against the coronavirus to speak at the U.N. General Assembly's big meeting next week, the assembly leader and New York City officials have said, prompting swift objections from at least one nation.With the diplomatic world's premier event being held in person for the first time during the pandemic, city International Affairs commissioner Penny Abeywardena told the assembly in a letter last week that officials consider the hall a "convention center" and therefore subject to the city's vaccination requirement."We are proud to join in the ongoing efforts to keep all U.N.G.A. attendees and our fellow New Yorkers safe during the pandemic," she and Mayor Bill de Blasio said in a statement Wednesday, adding that the city would offer free, walk-in vaccinations — Johnson & Johnson's single shot — and testing outside the U.N. during the meeting.G.A. President Abdulla Shahid embraced the vaccination requirement in a letter Tuesday, calling it "an important step in our return to a fully-functional General Assembly."But Russian Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia blasted the vaccine demand as a "clearly discriminatory" infringement on nations' rights at the U.N."We believe that no measures beyond reasonable precautions should be introduced that de-facto prevent member states to participate in a meeting in GA Hall," he wrote to Shahid in a Wednesday letter seen by The Associated Press.Requesting an urgent Assembly meeting Thursday to discuss the matter, Nebenzia said the group needed to think about people who can't be vaccinated for medical reasons and those who have developed antibodies from very recent cases of COVID-19. He also pointed to people who have gotten vaccines that don't have World Health Organization approval — the city's criterion for an acceptable inoculation, according to de Blasio spokesperson Mitch Schwartz.The WHO is reviewing Russia's Sputnik V vaccine but hasn't yet approved it.The city's letter represented a rare effort to broach conditions for goings-on at the U.N. headquarters, which is international territory. Under a 1947 agreement between the U.N. and the United States, the world body has considerable autonomy — police and American officials need permission to come in, and no federal, state or local law applies if it conflicts with U.N. rules.It's not immediately clear how the vaccination requirement will be enforced. Schwartz said it would be up to the U.N. An inquiry was sent to the Assembly.Stephane Dujarric, a spokesperson for U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, noted the Assembly's authority to make decisions affecting delegates but said the organization would work to help implement them.Nor is it clear how many of the dignitaries converging on the U.N. next week are vaccinated — or whether their aides had access to the vaccine.Some 104 heads of state and government and 23 cabinet ministers  plan to deliver their countries' signature speeches in person from the Assembly hall's marble rostrum. Other nations' leaders are speaking by video — the only option any country had last year, when the virus crisis prompted an extraordinary decision to hold the world's premier diplomatic gathering virtually.This time, each leader who shows up in person can bring along only six people to the U.N. headquarters, and only four into the Assembly hall. Meanwhile, the world body is requiring all its own staffers in the building during the week to be vaccinated.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Bill ChappellAsylum-seekers camping at El Chaparral crossing port line up to be vaccinated against COVID-19 last month in Tijuana, Mexico, on the border with the U.S.Guillermo Arias /AFP via Getty Imageshide captionAsylum-seekers camping at El Chaparral crossing port line up to be vaccinated against COVID-19 last month in Tijuana, Mexico, on the border with the U.S.People applying to immigrate to the U.S. will have to show they've been vaccinated against COVID-19 as part of a required medical exam, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services says. The new policy takes effect on Oct. 1.The requirement includes an exception for children who are too young to receive the vaccine as well as for people with medical conditions that rule them out for the shot. It also outlines a waiver process for people who refuse to be vaccinated due to religious and other reasons.The COVID-19 shot joins a list of well-established vaccines required by the U.S., from hepatitis A to polio and varicella (chickenpox), according to apolicy updateissued by USCIS."If the applicant has not received any of the listed vaccinations and the vaccinations are age appropriate and medically appropriate, the applicant has a Class A condition and is inadmissible," the USCIS said. The agency is part of the Department of Homeland Security.The Centers for Disease Control and Preventionsaid last monththat because its advisory committee has recommended COVID-19 vaccination for all Americans eligible to receive it, the vaccine should be required for immigration applicants as well. The new policy stems from that announcement, USCIS said.The new rule applies to prospective permanent residents or anyone else who must undergo an immigration medical examination. The exams, which are performed by doctors whom the USCIS designates as civil surgeons, can be conducted in the U.S. or overseas — but they won't be considered complete without either a document showing vaccination against COVID-19, or an approved exception or waiver.Anyone who "objects to vaccines based on religious or moral convictions" can request a waiver from the USCIS, the agency said. But there's also a caveat: Prospective immigrants can't pick and choose which vaccines they reject."The applicant needs to demonstrate opposition to vaccinations in all forms, not just certain vaccinations," according to the agency.USCIS officers would evaluate those waivers on an individual basis. But the agency could also issue blanket vaccine waivers for certain groups of people — for instance, if they're coming to the U.S. from a country where the vaccine is not widely available.Blanket waivers would require a recommendation from the CDC, the USCIS said.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Scott HensleyA health care worker administers a third dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine at a senior living facility in Worcester, Pa., in August.Hannah Beier/Bloomberg via Getty Imageshide captionA health care worker administers a third dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine at a senior living facility in Worcester, Pa., in August.The Food and Drug Administration released an analysis by Pfizer on the need for a booster shot of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine.Pfizer'sanalysissays data from Israel and the United States in the context of the delta variant suggests "that vaccine protection against COVID-19 infection wanes approximately 6 to 8 months following the second dose."The company said the available data supports its request for FDA approval of a third dose of the COVID-19 vaccine to be given about six months after the second dose in people 16 years and older.The agency posted the briefing document and data ahead of a public advisory committee meeting scheduled for Friday. The committee is the same one that voted in support of emergency authorization of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in December.In an unusual wrinkle, the FDA's analysis, which would shed light on the agency's stance, wasn't released simultaneously. Typically the agency posts its own briefing document at the same time as a company's.Late Wednesday morning, the agencyput its analysis onlinewithout taking a clear stand on whether it supports a booster. The FDA noted that some observational studies suggest that the efficacy of Pfizer-BioNTech's vaccine wanes with time and may be challenged by the delta variant. However, the agency noted that current data indicates that the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines "still afford protection against severe COVID-19 disease and death in the United States."In support of a booster, some public health officials have cited research that shows a drop in protection from infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, several months after vaccination. Others have countered that the vaccines remain highly effective in preventing serious illness, hospitalization and death, even against the delta variant.Some doctors have said the need for a third shot of the COVID-19 vaccine is clearest in groups at special risk, such as people with compromised immune systems or older adults. In August, the FDA authorized a third dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines for immunocompromised people.As a result of disagreements in the medical and public health communities, the FDA advisory committee's deliberations may be more contentious this time around. While the agency isn't required to follow the advice of the committee, it usually does.The Biden administration has set a goal of Sept. 20 to begin rolling out boosters for people who were fully vaccinated months ago to bolster protection against the virus further. The data for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID vaccine is the first to make it to the FDA for review.The administration's announcement of a target date for booster availability before the FDA, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and their experts made their own assessment was controversial.Details on eligibility and timing of a booster would hinge on the FDA's decision on Pfizer's application.The World Health Organization has criticized developed countries' plans to offer booster shots widely when poorer countries still don't have enough vaccine to begin immunizing their people."We have been calling for vaccine equity from the beginning, not after the richest countries have been taken care of," WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Sept. 7.He asked for a moratorium on boosters through the end of the year, except for groups of people at high risk, to help every country vaccinate 40% or more of its population. His call for a moratorium has gone unheeded.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

"We're back. I think we can breathe easier even if it's behind a mask. We can feel relaxed about the fact that it works.""The Lion King," "Hamilton" and "Wicked" all staked out Tuesday to reopen together in early May after then-New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo picked Sept. 14 for when Broadway could begin welcoming back audiences at full capacity.The trio of shows were beaten by Bruce Springsteen's concert show in June and the opening of the new play "Pass Over" on Aug. 22, as well as the reopening of two big musicals — "Hadestown" and "Waitress."But the return of the three musicals — the spiritual anchors of modern Broadway's success — as well as the long-running "Chicago" and the reopening of the iconic TKTS booth both on Tuesday are important signals that Broadway's most valuable shows are back, despite pressure and uncertainty from the spread of the delta variant."We go to a theater for catharsis. Literally that's what we go for: to be in communion with each other, hear a story told in the dark and experience catharsis," said "Hamilton" creator Lin-Manuel Miranda. "For a while, it wasn't safe to do that. And it's safe to come back now with the protocols we have in place."People wait outside the Richard Rodgers Theatre for a chance to purchase cancel tickets forHamiltonon Tuesday.Mary Altaffer/APhide captionPeople wait outside the Richard Rodgers Theatre for a chance to purchase cancel tickets forHamiltonon Tuesday.Ticketholders to all three mega-hits must prove they are fully vaccinated with an FDA- or WHO-authorized vaccine and masks must be worn at all times, except when eating or drinking in designated areas."I think it actually won't feel real to me until we have an audience in front of us," said L. Steven Taylor, who stars in "The Lion King" as Mufasa. "It's such an important element to this, and especially, I think, after everything that we've gone through."Actors across Broadway say they're itching to get back on stage after more than a year of waiting, trusting the health experts to make the process safe."It's a little bit like when you're on an airplane and there's turbulence," said Sharon Wheatley, a veteran actor in the show "Come From Away," which resumes its Broadway run Sept. 21. "I have to trust the pilot, I have to trust the air traffic controllers. I feel nervous, but I have to understand that I don't know as much as these people do."Eric (left) and Woon Lee, of Queens, pose with their tickets to Tuesday's performance ofThe Lion King.Mary Altaffer/APhide captionEric (left) and Woon Lee, of Queens, pose with their tickets to Tuesday's performance ofThe Lion King."Hamilton," which opened six years ago, "Wicked," which opened 17 years ago and "The Lion King," which opened 23 years ago, form the bedrock of modern Broadway, virtually immune to downturns, shifts in tourism and rivals.On Tuesday, they planned staggered openings — 7 p.m. for "Wicked" at the Gershwin Theatre and 7:30 p.m. for "The Lion King" at the Minskoff Theatre. "Hamilton" at 8 p.m. at the Richard Rodgers Theatre, all three at full capacity.Another sign that Broadway is inching back to normalcy is the reopening of the famed TKTS booth in the heart of Times Square, where visitors can get same-day and some next-day discount Broadway and off-Broadway tickets."It's such a big step forward," said Victoria Bailey, executive director of the nonprofit Theatre Development Fund, which runs the booth. "To get it open and such a symbol to people that theater is coming back."Reporters interview the first people in line to buy discounted Broadway show tickets at TKTS in New York's Times Square on Tuesday.Mary Altaffer/APhide captionReporters interview the first people in line to buy discounted Broadway show tickets at TKTS in New York's Times Square on Tuesday.Bailey says Broadway's return will be less like a flick of a light switch and more like a dimmer, with a slow build to regular attendance. "We'll know so much more in two or three weeks, but you can't swim unless you can start by dog-paddling."For Miranda, getting his visionary show back in front of a live audience after 18 months will help the actors and crew but also businesses all over Times Square that rely on the theaters, like his favorite pizza shop. There's nothing like live, he said."It's one thing to see something on the screen. And I'm thrilled 'Hamilton' was was available on a screen in a time when we couldn't go to a theater. But I'm even more thrilled that now it can be experienced the way it was meant to, live in front of an audience, the final collaborator every night."Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
The Associated PressWestern lowland gorillas are seen in their habitat at Zoo Atlanta on Tuesday. Nearly all of the zoo's 20 gorillas have symptoms of having contracted the coronavirus from a zoo staff worker, according to zoo officials.Ron Harris/APhide captionWestern lowland gorillas are seen in their habitat at Zoo Atlanta on Tuesday. Nearly all of the zoo's 20 gorillas have symptoms of having contracted the coronavirus from a zoo staff worker, according to zoo officials.ATLANTA — At least 18 of the 20 gorillas at Atlanta's zoo have now tested positive for COVID-19, an outbreak that began just days before the zoo had hoped to obtain aveterinary vaccinefor the primates, officials said Tuesday.Zoo Atlanta had announced the first positive tests among the western lowland gorillas on Friday  after employees noticed the gorillas had been coughing, had runny noses and showed changes in appetite. A veterinary lab at the University of Georgia returned positive tests for the respiratory illness.Zoo Atlanta says the National Veterinary Services Laboratories in Ames, Iowa, confirms that at least four of the samples from the gorillas so far have tested positive for the delta variant of the virus.The zoo says it is using monoclonal antibodies to treat the gorillas at risk of developing complications from the virus.Officials say there's no evidence that the gorillas can pass the virus back to humans and visitors are too far away to be infected by gorillas.Because the gorillas live close together in four troops, zoo officials say it's impossible to keep infected animals isolated.Zoo officials say they believe an asymptomatic employee who cares for the gorillas passed on the virus. The employee had been fully vaccinated and was wearing protective equipment such as a mask and gloves."According to our guidelines for animal care staff, if they have the slightest symptoms of a cold they are to stay home," said Dr. Sam Rivera, the zoo's senior director of animal health. "It so happens that the animal care team member, the following day she developed signs that she suspected might be consistent with COVID and was tested and was positive."Senior Director of Animal Health at Zoo Atlanta Sam Rivera said the zoo will vaccinate the gorillas with a veterinary vaccine that it had been on the waiting list for prior to the gorillas' positive tests.Eight gorillas at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park were treated for the virus in January. One San Diego silverback received anexperimental antibody regimen, and all recovered.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Mary Louise KellyAt-home tests are becoming increasingly difficult to find despite manufacturers boosting production as COVID-19 cases rise in schools and employers increase monitoring.Scott Olson/Getty Imageshide captionAt-home tests are becoming increasingly difficult to find despite manufacturers boosting production as COVID-19 cases rise in schools and employers increase monitoring.The COVID-19 response plan that President Biden unveiled last week aims to dramatically increase the accessibility of rapid tests for the coronavirus.The Biden administration announced it was spending $2 billion on 280 million quick-turnaround tests to be distributed to community health centers, food banks, testing sites, shelters, prisons and other congregate settings. It's also leaning on Walmart, Amazon and Kroger to sell rapid tests at wholesale cost for the next three months.Such quick-turnaround tests can be taken at home or at a point of care and deliver results often in under an hour — as opposed to the more sensitive but more time-consuming PCR tests that require laboratory processing.Dr. Michael Mina, an epidemiology professor at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, has been an outspoken proponent for wide availability of rapid tests, even with the arrival of effective vaccines."Should anything go wrong with the vaccines, we need backup plans," he toldNPR's Mary Louise Kelly in April, before the highly contagious delta variant drove the current wave of infections. "If new variants come around that get around people's immune systems, especially in elderly whose immune systems a year after they get vaccinated might be waning in terms of their level of protection, we want to be able to limit spread as much as possible."In a new conversation with Kelly onAll Things Considered, Mina warned that even with increased production, the availability of tests will soon become an issue afterBiden announcedthat businesses with 100 or more employees must either require their employees to be vaccinated or test them weekly.There are already reports of these rapid at-home antigen tests beinghard to findon store shelves and online."We are about to see what I think is going to be another testing crisis in this country," Mina said. "While I am extraordinarily supportive of the president's action plan to increase the accessibility and availability of these rapid tests ... unfortunately, we do not have the scale of either [rapid or PCR] tests to be able to get fast turnaround time."Interview highlights contain extended web-only sections.On how well rapid antigen tests work compared to PCR testsFor public health, [rapid tests] work very well. And what I mean by that is if the question is "Am I infectious right now?" then these tests are very accurate. They have very high sensitivity to detect people who are currently infectious. The PCR test is the gold standard, but as a medical diagnostic. If as a physician, a patient says, "I want to know 'was I infectious last week?' " the PCR test can help with that. But the delays and the lack of ready access makes [PCR tests] a much more ill-equipped test to be able to actually curb spread during this pandemic.On why businesses, schools and other institutions do not accept rapid testsIn the United States, we have had this unfortunate misperception that has really started with the federal government in 2020 ... that these tests were not accurate. ... A lot of our research at Harvard was dedicated this past year just to show that we need to hold public health tools to a different set of standards. Not worse, but different.And that it's actually the speed of a test and not just the molecular sensitivity that becomes much more crucial. ... These tests are the absolute better test for public health. And now finally, we are seeing the CDC recognize this. We're in fact, of course, seeing the Biden administration recognizing this.On whether he would rely on a rapid test for his childThe short answer is yes, I would rely on it. But if there are outbreaks in my community going on and my child has COVID symptoms, then in this climate I would not send my child to school if they had symptoms, and that should be step one. ...And the reason is there isn't another choice. You can say I want a PCR test, but you're not going to get that result for three or four days. By the time you decide to make an appointment, get the swab, send it out to a lab, get the results two days later. So there isn't actually a better option for the immediate term. And so as a parent, I would say, yes, absolutely. This is the best test I have at my disposal right now.And even if somebody is symptomatic, if they are not turning positive on a rapid test, they are very, very unlikely to be spreading the virus. The symptoms are often the immune response to the virus, so they might have been infectious two days ago, but if they're negative now, they're probably not transmitting now.On why rapid testing still costs so much in the U.S.The United States is a major outlier in this way. Around the world, if you go to Europe, you can you can get these tests for under a dollar, and you can in fact get them all the time. They're available; they're readily available anywhere. You could go to the U.K. and you can get seven tests for free, delivered to your door every single day, if you want.The reason it's so expensive here is because we have no market competition. ... The actual cost of the devices is very inexpensive. But what we need is market competition. We need more producers to get into the United States market. And to do that, we have to release some of the regulatory barriers that we have thus far had.On whether President Biden's new rapid test initiative will get the U.S. enough testing kitsSo the Biden plan at the moment — and I want to be very clear about this — will not get the U.S. the number of tests that we actually need so that people can feel confident that when they walk into their CVS that they will see a box of rapid tests that are available. But what the Biden plan is doing is it will stimulate an increase and flurry of activity from companies to try to sell their tests in the U.S. market. Because now we have for the first time, very wide and high level support for these tools. So it will stimulate U.S. innovation and foreign innovation — and these companies actually exist. We could have tens of millions of tests every day available on the shelves instead of 1 million if we allow increased companies to enter into the market. And I think the Biden plan is going to very much stimulate that.On how the federal government could make rapid testing cheaper and even more widely availableThe president can come out and state that testing for public health during a public health emergency is utilizing public health tests and tools and not medical devices. And why that's so important is: If we define these tests as public health tools, then we can use a whole different set of regulatory metrics to evaluate and authorize them very, very fast. And it would allow us to very quickly catch up to our European peers. So it's actually just a simple problem of how we define these tests in the United States versus Europe that is really preventing them from coming to the U.S. market.So the president has a solution. There is a simple solution. We just have to make sure that everyone is aware of what the real bottleneck is here.Sam Gringlas and Sarah Handel produced and edited this conversation for broadcast.

The conference was aimed at young people ages 15 to 25.Gage Skidmorehide captionDr. Simone Gold discourages vaccination against COVID-19 and promotes alternative, unproven therapies. She has spent much of the past year speaking at events like this one held in West Palm Beach, Fla., in December. The conference was aimed at young people ages 15 to 25.Last month, Dr. Simone Gold stood before a crowd at a conservative church in Thousand Oaks, Calif., and delivered a talk riddled with misinformation. She told people to avoid vaccination against the coronavirus. As an alternative, she pushed drugs that have not been proven effective at treating COVID-19 — drugs that she also offered to prescribe to the audience in exchange for $90 telehealth appointments."Don't text me when you've gotten a positive test; I don't want to hear it," she said to the gathering. "I've told you ahead of time to get the medicines. It can take a week because we're so swamped."Almost everything Gold said in her 45-minute talk was contrary tothe best science and medical standardsof care for treating COVID-19. But there was one thing she said that was at least partially true: "I am an emergency physician."NPR found that Gold's emergency medicine certification lapsed in December of last year, but she still is, as she claims, a licensed physician in the state of California (her license lists her professional address as a UPS shipping store in Beverly Hills).Simone Gold's board certification in emergency medicine (listed under her maiden name of Tizes) expired in December of last year, but she still has a license to practice medicine.American Board of Emergency Medicine/Screen Shot by NPRhide captionSimone Gold's board certification in emergency medicine (listed under her maiden name of Tizes) expired in December of last year, but she still has a license to practice medicine.Despite more than a year spent spreading misinformation about a pandemic that has killedmore than 650,000 Americans, she has what might be considered a professional clean bill of health with no complaints, disciplinary actions or malpractice lawsuits on her record. The California Medical Board, which oversees her license, told NPR it expects doctors to "follow the standard of care when treating patients at all times." But the medical board declined to say whether it was investigating Gold, citing reasons of confidentiality.Gold is not theonly physician promoting misinformation while avoiding professional censure. NPR looked at medical licenses for 16 doctors, including Gold, who have proven track records of doing so online and in media interviews. Fifteen of the 16 had active licenses in good standing. One appeared to have let his license expire, but there was no suggestion in his record that it was because of any disciplinary action.Now, some organizations affiliated with medical licensing are encouraging action.Late last month, the American Board of Emergency Medicine, which had until this year certified Gold under her maiden name, Tizes, put outa statementwarning it could revoke certification for any of its specialistsfor spreading "inaccurate information."TheFederation of State Medical Boardsissueda statement in late Julywarning that "Physicians who generate and spread COVID-19 vaccine misinformation or disinformation are risking disciplinary action by state medical boards, including the suspension or revocation of their medical license."So, why hasn't more punitive action already been taken?At its heart, the problem is the fragmented medical licensing system in the United States. Individual states have licensing boards made up of a mix of doctors, lawyers and private citizens. These boards, with an eye toward medical malpractice, usually respond only to complaints against individual physicians."People assume that licensing boards are on the lookout, they're on the internet," saysDr. Humayun Chaudhry, president of the Federation of State Medical Boards. "They actually don't have the resources — neither the money nor the manpower — to monitor what happens on the internet or social media."In the absence of oversight, doctors such as Gold have been able to spread misinformation with impunity.Imran Ahmed, chief executive of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, which tracks vaccine misinformation online, says that even though the number of doctors involved in spreading this sort of bad informationis tiny, they're having an outsized influence. Other people in the anti-vaccine movement promote their posts "because they have the 'Dr.' before their name and they appear to understand what they're talking about."Ahmed says that having a medical degree may also be helping these doctors skirt social media bans on coronavirus misinformation. "We will find that social media companies will hide behind any excuse that they can to leave up [the profiles of] those people spreading misinformation, and one of the excuses they use is citing their medical credentials," Ahmed says.In fact, while other promoters of bad information saw their Twitter profiles suspended this summer, Gold's followers swelled to more than 300,000. And it's not just happening via social media: Doctors who discourage vaccination have found regular spots on conservative radio and TV talk shows and on cable networks. Among the most prominent promoters of this brand of false information is former Trump strategist Steve Bannon, who regularly interviews a small, rotating cast of these physicians on his talk show.The misinformation — which usually involvesinflating the risksof vaccines and offering the false promise of alternative therapies — is coming as cases ofCOVID-19 surge nationwide, mainly in areas with low rates of vaccination. Other doctors working in those places are understandably frustrated."We would like there to be some easy answer out there, some medication that's been around forever that we could just take from home," says Sonja Rasmussen, a pediatrician and epidemiologist at the University of Florida in Gainesville.The problem, she says, is that so far the alternative therapies such as ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine have not been proven effective against COVID-19."There are outliers out there who are preaching nonsense," saysDr. Kendall McKenzie, the chair of the department of emergency medicine at the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson. While Gold has been giving talks to packed audiences, McKenzie has been dealing with packed ICUs filled with sick, unvaccinated people. He says he sees patients every day being influenced by the kind of misinformation that Gold and others are promoting."What it's doing is filling up my emergency department with intubated patients and ultimately leading to deaths," he says.Chaudhry says there have been some recent cases where disciplinary action has moved forward. In May, the Oregon Medical Boardsuspended the licenseof a doctor for encouraging patients to go unmasked, and Hawaii's medical board is pursuing a complaint against a state health official and a physician, both of whom arereportedly promoting alternative therapies for treating COVID-19— alternatives that federal agencies havespecifically warned are not helpful andcan sometimes be harmful.Chaudhry thinks many licensing boards may already be conducting additional confidential investigations against doctors promoting misinformation. Those investigations, he adds, are typically only triggered by a complaint, but the complaint can come from anyone. "People don't realize it doesn't have to be the patient themselves. It can be a patient's family member; it can be another doctor," he says.Gold has new problems: She participated in theJan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitoland is now awaiting trial on criminal chargesof forcing her way into the building and engaging in disorderly behavior. She has pleaded not guilty and through her lawyer declined NPR's request for an interview.While she awaits trial, Gold continues to give talks as a fully licensed physician.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

Classroom doors are swinging open for about a million New York City public school students in the nation's largest experiment of in-person learning during the coronavirus pandemic.NEW YORK — School started Monday for about a million New York City public school students in the nation's largest experiment of in-person learning during the coronavirus pandemic.The first day of school coincided with several milestones in the city's pandemic recovery that hinge on vaccine mandates.Nearly all of the city's 300,000 employees were required to be back in their workplaces, in person, Monday as the city ended remote work. Most will eitherneed to be vaccinated, or undergo weekly COVID-19 testingto remain in their jobs.The city was also set to start enforcingrules requiring workers and patrons to be vaccinated to go indoorsat restaurants, museums, gyms and entertainment venues. The vaccination requirement has been in place for weeks, but had not previously been enforced.There will also bea vaccine mandate — with no test-out option — for teachers, though they have been given until Sept. 27 to get their first shot.Unlike some school districts across the country that are still offering online instruction to families that prefer it, New York City officials provided no remote option despite the persistence of the highly transmissible delta variant of COVID-19.New York City kept schools open for most of the last school year, with some students doing a mix of remote and in-person instruction, but the majority of families chose all-remote learning. That choice won't be available this year, Mayor Bill de Blasio has insisted."There are kids who have not been in a classroom in a year and a half, and they deserve better," de Blasio said Monday. "Kids need to be back in school for their mental health, their physical health, their ability to develop socially, and for so many reasons."U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona visited a Bronx elementary school and appeared remotely at the mayor's briefing to praise the city's school opening plan. "They did it right, and I know this is going to be an awesome year for New York, for everyone," Cardona said.Masks will be required for all students and staff members, as is the case in schools across New York state.Samiya Ramdial's mask was firmly in place for the start of first grade at Public School 33 in Manhattan — and so were her spiffy black sneakers."These are great shoes," Samiya said. "I can dance in these."Under the city's blended learning model, Samiya was in kindergarten in person part-time last year and learned remotely the rest of the time."She preferred in person of course, because she got to see her friends, and she enjoys being with the teachers as well," her mother, Christina Brea, said.A girl has her temperature checked as she arrives for the first day of school at Brooklyn's PS 245 elementary school on Monday in New York.Mark Lennihan/APhide captionA girl has her temperature checked as she arrives for the first day of school at Brooklyn's PS 245 elementary school on Monday in New York.There is no vaccine mandate for students 12 and over who are eligible for inoculations, but vaccinations will be required to participate in contact sports like football and basketball as well as some extracurricular activities like band practice and theater. About two-thirds of the city's 12-to-17-year-olds are currently vaccinated.In the U.S., anyone 12 and older is eligible for COVID-19 vaccines. The Food and Drug Administration's vaccine chief said last week he is hopeful children as young as 5 will be eligible to get vaccinated by the end of 2021.De Blasio, a Democrat in his final months in office, has insisted that masks, cleaning protocols and random COVID-19 testing makes school buildings safe. But he has gotten pushback both from parents who want their children home and from unions representing teachers and other school staff members.The city has been in arbitration with the United Federation of Teachers, which represents almost 80,000 teachers in city public schools, over issues including accommodations for teachers who say they have health issues that prevent them from being vaccinated.The arbitrator ruled late Friday  that the city must offer non-classroom assignments to teachers who aren't vaccinated because of medical and religious exemptions.A mother gives her son a kiss as he arrives for the first day of class at Brooklyn's PS 245 elementary school on Monday, in New York.Mark Lennihan/APhide captionA mother gives her son a kiss as he arrives for the first day of class at Brooklyn's PS 245 elementary school on Monday, in New York.Under the school system's coronavirus protocols, if there is a a positive case in an elementary school classroom, students in the class will receive remote instruction while quarantining for 10 days. In middle schools and high schools, only unvaccinated students will quarantine.De Blasio said he does not expect many classrooms to close."We do not expect to see anywhere near the kind of closures or classroom disruptions that we saw last year," he said Monday.Meanwhile, other unions for city workers have objected to the mayor's decision to order employees back into workplaces, saying that if they were performing their jobs well remotely, they should be allowed to continue."The way that this full-time return to office was rolled out with less than two weeks notice has been the part that has been so disorienting," said Ashley Firestone, who works for the city's Department of Cultural Affairs."There are so many aspects of this that have not been considered and thoughtful in a humane or empathic way to the humanity of the workers that have been putting themselves on the line for the last 18 months on behalf of the city," she added.Some city employees like Yvette Santiago had been back to work on a limited basis. But the mandatory full-time return will require some adjustment."The return to work has been a little anxious," said Santiago, the director of the Department for the Aging. "I'm just trying to adjust."The Municipal Labor Committee, an umbrella group for unions representing municipal workers, has also threatened legal action if the mayor moves to eliminate the option of weekly virus testing for workers who opt not to get vaccinated.The outbreak had disrupted much of public life, including the shuttering of restaurants and other gathering places. City officials have pushed for vaccinations to prevent the further spread of the virus, particularly more highly transmittable variants that could prompt another round of mass closures.On Monday, the city began enforcing its vaccine mandate at indoor eateries, museums, gyms and entertainment venues.At the Museum of Modern Art in midtown Manhattan, lines formed at the door as patrons swiped through phone apps or dug into their wallets for their proof of vaccination.And a group of restaurant and bar owners has sued over the vaccination requirement for indoor dining and employees, saying the city has overstepped its legal authority.Allison Torres, a server at Court Square Diner in Queens, had turned away nearly a dozen customers by midmorning, including a regular."I'm sorry, today is when they go strict," she explained to a couple of young men before turning them away because they did not have proof they've been vaccinated."We're definitely going to lose business," Torres said. "I'm going to lose money and my boss is going to lose money."Torres said the diner would follow the rules "because they're the rules — but we don't have to like it."Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Scott NeumanA medical worker tests a person for COVID-19 last month in Mobile, Ala. A surge of coronavirus cases in the state has stretched hospital ICUs to capacity, making it difficult for patients with other conditions to find ICU beds.Jay Reeves/APhide captionA medical worker tests a person for COVID-19 last month in Mobile, Ala. A surge of coronavirus cases in the state has stretched hospital ICUs to capacity, making it difficult for patients with other conditions to find ICU beds.Ray DeMonia, 73, was born and raised in Cullman, Ala., but he died on Sept. 1, some 200 miles away in an intensive care unit in Meridian, Miss.Last month, DeMonia, who spent 40 years in the antiques and auctions business, suffered a cardiac emergency. But it was because hospitals are full due to the coronavirus — and not his heart — that he was forced to spend his last days so far from home, according to his family."Due to COVID 19, CRMC emergency staff contacted 43 hospitals in 3 states in search of a Cardiac ICU bed and finally located one in Meridian, MS.," the last paragraph of DeMonia'sobituaryreads, referring to the Cullman Regional Medical Center."In honor of Ray, please get vaccinated if you have not, in an effort to free up resources for non COVID related emergencies ... ," the obituary reads. "He would not want any other family to go through what his did."NPR was unable to reach the DeMonia family. A spokesperson for Cullman Regional Medical Center, who declined to give specifics of Ray DeMonia's case, citing privacy concerns, confirmed to NPR that he was transferred from the hospital but said the reason was that he required "a higher level of specialized care not available" there.The family's challenge to find proper care comes amid the latest surge in COVID-19 cases that have once again strained many ICUs to the breaking point as the highly transmissible delta variant of the coronavirus spreads. Although some people infected after vaccination do require hospitalization, astudyreleased last week by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicates that unvaccinated people were far more likely to become infected, to be hospitalized and to die from COVID-19."Looking at cases over the past two months, when the delta variant was the predominant variant circulating in this country, those who were unvaccinated were about 4 1/2 times more likely to get COVID-19, over 10 times more likely to be hospitalized and 11 times more likely to die from the disease," Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the CDC's director, said last week at aWhite House briefing.ICU capacity in Alabama has been maxed out in recent weeks, and COVID-19 patients occupy about half of the intensive care beds, according toJohns Hopkins University.Speaking last week,Dr. Scott Harris, the head of the Alabama Department of Public Health, said the state was continuing to experience "a real crisis" with ICU bed capacity."We have had a little bit of a plateau over the last week. I'm very thankful for that," he said, adding, "The numbers aren't great. But the numbers at least have not continued to go up."DeMonia's daughter, Raven DeMonia, toldThe Washington Postthat it was "shocking" when the hospital told the family there were no ICU beds anywhere near Cullman, a town of about 16,000 some 50 miles north of Birmingham."It was like, 'What do you mean?' " after learning that her father would be airlifted to Mississippi, she told thePost. "I never thought this would happen to us."Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Ben GilesFromDays before the deadline for Arizona lawmakers to pass a budget, state Rep. Joseph Chaplik said he would refuse to vote for a GOP-negotiated spending plan unless he got something in return."I said I'm not signing onto the education budgetif we don't have control of the masks," the Scottsdale Republican told conservative radio host Garret Lewis in June.Chaplik was referring to mask mandates — requirements for students, staff and visitors at Arizona public schools to wear face coverings to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus. Republicans such as Chaplik were demanding the budget include a policy banning the state's public schools from issuing such mandates.The controversial ban on mask mandates is now scheduled to take effect on Sept. 29 after Chaplik and other Republicans got their way.But that's where attorney Roopali Desai says lawmakers got it wrong.In August, Desai fileda lawsuit on behalf of Arizona's teachers union, school business officials, civic groups and othersarguing a handful of policies passed as part of the budget are unconstitutional. That includes rules for conducting elections, regulations for what teachers can and can't talk about in their classrooms, and the ban on local school leaders requiring students and staff to wear masks.What all those policies have in common, Desai says, is they have nothing in common with the budget."There's not any budget provision relating to a prohibition on COVID-19 mitigation policies [such as mask requirements]," she says. "It's simply a substantive policy that was put in here because ... certain legislators insisted that it be in there if somebody wanted them to vote on a budget."The city of Phoenix later filed a separate lawsuit making the same argument. City attorneys saya policy designed to undermine civilian oversight of the Phoenix Police Departmentis unconstitutional.It's not the substance of the laws that are at issue, Desai says. It's the way Republican lawmakers approved them.Chaplik and other Republicans leveraged their votes on the budget for something in return. It's a common tactic in many states, even in Congress, called horse-trading.When legislators negotiate a budget,there are typically a dozen or so bills that detail the spending plan.One is known as the "feed bill" — it's a list of all the appropriations of state revenues. Other budget bills act as instruction manuals for the feed bill — they tell state agencies and local governments how to spend money in the budget.When there's nothing connecting a policy in the budget bills to the state's spending plans, that's a violation of the Arizona Constitution, Desai says.There's a constitutional rule that a bill can only tackle one thing, or one single subject, at a time. When it comes to the budget, Desai says the subject is supposed to be how to spend taxpayer dollars.Most states have similar rules in their constitutions requiring bills to stick to one subject at a time, and some, like Arizona, extend those rules to the budget, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.Beth Lewis, executive director of Save Our Schools Arizona, says Republicans took the horse-trading process too far this year. "That's just not the way the legislative process should work," she says.Rocio Hernandez/KJZZhide captionBeth Lewis, executive director of Save Our Schools Arizona, says Republicans took the horse-trading process too far this year. "That's just not the way the legislative process should work," she says.Horse-trading may be a part of politics, but Republicans took it too far this year, according to Beth Lewis, a mother, teacher and executive director of Save Our Schools Arizona."At the end of the day, these lawmakers and the special interests that are driving these, you know, sort of pet projects or pet positions, were forced in to get other people to vote on the budget," she says. "And that's just not the way the legislative process should work."Republican Senate President Karen Fann spoke publicly about the budget last month, blaming her party's dwindling numbers at the state Capitol for a budget packed with significant new policy.Republicans, who've held legislative majorities in both chambers for nearly three decades, don't give Democrats a seat at the table when it comes to the budget. This year, the Republican majority was so slim that to pass a budget on party lines, all 31 Republicans in the House and all 16 in the Senate had to vote for it."Everyone knew that they were either No. 16, or No. 31, which created a challenge. ... We ended up having to put policy in the budget that not necessarily everybody was on board with. But to get that budget moving, that's what we had to do," Fann says. "That was not fun," she adds.Lewis says lawmakers can, and should, do better."That's definitely politics," Lewis says. "But with the single-subject rule with budget bills, we should really be talking about appropriations, and I think this is what the courts are going to decide, right? Is it unconstitutional to push in all of this other legislation when lawmakers are supposed to be talking about how to fund our state budget?"There are a number of laws at stake in the two complaints filed against Arizona. Those laws are scheduled to take effect on Sept. 29. In the separate lawsuits, Desai and attorneys for the city of Phoenix have asked the court to block the state from enforcing laws they shouldn't have passed as part of the budget.A ruling in their favor could also send a message to Republicans that politics as usual, when it comes to budget negotiations, must change.The budget, Desai says, should stick to the budget."It's in our Constitution," she says. "We've gone astray from that process; we need the courts to set those boundaries. And then hopefully, moving forward, if we're successful in this case, the Legislature won't engage in these kinds of shenanigans."Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Jaclyn DiazA droplet falls from a syringe after a health care worker was injected with the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine last year at a hospital in Providence, R.I.David Goldman/APhide captionA droplet falls from a syringe after a health care worker was injected with the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine last year at a hospital in Providence, R.I.If a conflict at one New York hospital over vaccine mandates for health care workers is any indication, the Biden administration's new effort to mandate vaccines for millions of workers could be infor an uphill battle.The White House is taking steps to require that millions of American workers, like federal workers, contractors, and certain health care workers, get a COVID-19 vaccine.The planwill requireworkers who are employed at hospitals, home health agencies and other types of medical facilities that participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs to get a COVID-19 vaccine.In New York, where former Gov. Andrew Cuomomandated that all health care workers in the state get a vaccine, employees at hospitals and long-term care facilities need to get their first dose by Sep. 27.At one local hospital in upstate New York, dozens of staff members walked away from their jobs after refusing to get vaccinated. The move has seriously disrupted care in the process.Lewis County General Hospital in Lowville, N.Y., announced Friday that it is pausing maternity services later this month because dozens of staff members quit rather than get COVID-19 vaccines.The hospital will be "unable to safely staff" its maternity department and newborn nursery as of Sept. 25,according to Lewis County Health System CEO Gerald Cayer. He added that other departments in the hospital are at risk as well if workers don't get vaccinated.As of Friday, 30 employees had resigned from Lewis County General Hospital. At least 464 people in the Lewis County Health System have been vaccinated — a 73% immunization rate among employees.Separately, there are 165 workers who haven't been vaccinated and haven't shared yet what their plans are as the state's Sept. 27 deadline for a first shot approaches."We have a challenge to work through with the vaccination mandate," Cayer said duringa recent news conference. "The number of resignations received leaves us no choice but to pause delivering babies."Lewis County has recorded 2,626 confirmed COVID-19casesas of Friday. The state lists the county as one at a "very high" risk level.About 46%of the county is fully vaccinated.To cut down on the spread of the coronavirus and its highly contagious variants, some states passed their own vaccine mandates for health care workers earlier this year.At least a dozen statesalready mandate vaccination or regular testing for health care workers. At least six states require that health care workers get vaccinated or face termination.Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon of Lakewood (center) and Assemblyman Kevin McCarty, D-Sacramento, (right) watch from the balcony outside the Assembly Chambers as protesters opposing vaccine mandates gather at the Capitol in Sacramento, Calif.Rich Pedroncelli/APhide captionAssembly Speaker Anthony Rendon of Lakewood (center) and Assemblyman Kevin McCarty, D-Sacramento, (right) watch from the balcony outside the Assembly Chambers as protesters opposing vaccine mandates gather at the Capitol in Sacramento, Calif.Other medical facilities have implemented vaccine or testing mandates independently from any government intervention. Private employers, such as Delta and United Airlines, have taken similar steps, side-steppingefforts by state officialsto ban local mandates requiring people to be vaccinated against COVID-19.Issues over vaccine, testing or mask mandateshave eruptedin U.S. schools as well. Last month, Chicago Public Schoolssaid10% of their school bus drivers quit because they're unwilling to get mandated vaccines.Other health care facilities have been acutely affected by the vaccine mandate standoff between bosses and their workers.The pandemic has already exacerbated staffing shortages at medical facilities in the United States. Hospitals around the country have also offeredincentivesto get workers to stick around during the pandemic, such as offering sign-on bonuses.Some health care administrators in Texas fear that mandating vaccines for workers will push desperately needed employees to quit,according to theTexas Tribune.In April, Houston Methodist hospital system was among the first in the nation to implement a vaccine mandate. The hospital system lost150 employees who refused to complyand either were fired or resigned.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Nate HegyiFromAt the region's biggest hospital, Kootenai Health in Coeur d'Alene, 97% of COVID-19 patients are unvaccinated and all of the intensive care unit beds are filled.Education Images/Universal Image via Getty Imageshide captionAt the region's biggest hospital, Kootenai Health in Coeur d'Alene, 97% of COVID-19 patients are unvaccinated and all of the intensive care unit beds are filled.Jeremy Smith and his wife Sheena are on a four-wheeler, leading me up a dirt road on the 20 acres of mostly undeveloped land they live on near Sagle, in the Idaho panhandle. We stop near a big grove of trees and get out. It's beautiful."We've got some Douglas fir. This is a grand pine. This is a maple," Smith says as he walks along a private trail.Smith and his extended family have been hunkering down here since the pandemic began. They are a minority in this very conservative part of Idaho. They take COVID-19 seriously and wear masks. And unlike 65% of the people in Bonner County, they're fully vaccinated."We've done everything we possibly could to stay healthy," Smith says.Which is why they are so frustrated about the situation in North Idaho. Earlier this week, state public health officialsactivated crisis standards of carefor at least 10 hospitals across ten Northern Idaho counties because of an unprecedented surge of hospitalizations due to COVID-19.This means health care facilities are overwhelmed and are now rationing care for everyone, regardless of their diagnosis."If we get hurt and go in now, our health care is almost certain to be compromised," Smith says. "It's really frustrating."Hospitals are cancelling most surgeries, warning of long wait times, and urging people to avoid risky activities that could land them in the emergency room because, bottom line, there might not be a bed available.Smith says his elderly, handicapped father has had to put off back surgery."He's going to be in pain until Christmas because of other people's choices, not because of anything we've done wrong," he says.Smith is angry, but understands what's going on. Many people in this part of Idaho have long been skeptical of authority, and any kind of government information. He's not surprised it hasone of the lowest vaccination ratesin the nation."This is a place that is very attractive to people who have an independent, self-sufficient mindset," he says. "The idea that if anything comes along, you can just take care of it."Driving around, you see a lot of yellow Gadsden flags that say "Don't Tread On Me." And since the beginning of the pandemic there have been loud protests against shutdowns, mask requirements and the vaccine."You don't plunge a whole entire civilization into an experimental vaccine," says Branden Sing, who lives in the city of Sandpoint.The Food and Drug Administrationfully approvingPfizer's COVID-19 vaccine in August hasn't swayed him to get a shot. He thinks the pandemic has been hyped up and that the vaccines were rushed."If you attach a death count clock on TV to any crisis it's going to be a fearfully driven situation," he says. "There's going to be a lot of people making a lot of mistakes."Sing says he has friends and family who have had adverse side effects from the vaccine. His mother-in-law, for instance, recently had a brain aneurysm caused by a spike in high blood pressure."I think my mother-in-law is a victim of the vaccine," he says.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says dangerous or deadly side effects from COVID vaccines are extremely rare.But again, Sing and many others in North Idaho don't trust those agencies. Instead, some are taking supplements and non-FDA approved medications to combat the virus. Sing believes COVID-19 isn't that big of a deal for people who keep their immune systems healthy.But there are a growing number of people here who aren't faring well. In the past week, 18 people have died in North Idaho from COVID-19 and there are currently more than 550 people hospitalized across the state. At the region's biggest hospital, Kootenai Health,97% of COVID patients are unvaccinatedand all of the intensive care unit beds are filled.Part-time North Idaho resident Ed Crosby's brother-in-law, who recently took a hard fall and hit his head, had to wait two days for an ICU bed to open up at Kootenai Health."He had to spend two days laying in the ER not getting the care that he really needed," Crosby says. "It made me extremely angry."The surge is also stressing out health care workers in the region as hospitals become overwhelmed."We are just seeing a huge influx of very actively sick people," says Kelli Hansen, a nurse at Bonner General Health, a 25-bed critical access hospital in Sandpoint.She's surprised by how many young, unvaccinated people are getting seriously ill from the delta variant."These people are afraid," she says. "They can't breathe. Their anxiety goes up. That means increased pain. That means they're not sleeping well. They're exhausted. It's heartbreaking to see that suffering happening."Hansen says her hospital is strapped for resources right now. It's also facing a staff shortage due to burnout, people getting sick, and skyrocketing housing prices that make North Idaho less affordable for nurses and other hospital staff.But Hansen still loves the job. She also tries to not to judge patients and others for not getting vaccinated. She's worked for 17 years in Sandpoint and understands the prevailing ethos here."Because of the newness of this vaccine and this pandemic, there are unknowns. I can see where someone might be uncomfortable," she says. "If that's the case and they choose not to [get vaccinated], I really implore people to take those other precautions such as masking, social distancing and taking care of themselves."But wearing masks and social distancing still isn't happening in much of North Idaho. Health officials fear that the worst may still be on its way because school just started. Most districts aren't requiring masks and there have already been reports of teachers and students testing positive for COVID-19.The number of people getting vaccinated in Idaho has more than doubled since July, but for the last three weeks it's been flat.This story was produced by the Mountain West News Bureau, a collaboration between Wyoming Public Media, Nevada Public Radio, Boise State Public Radio in Idaho, KUNR in Nevada, the O'Connor Center for the Rocky Mountain West in Montana, KUNC in Colorado, KUNM in New Mexico, with support from affiliate stations across the region.

The Associated PressMortician Shawn Troy stands at the grave of his father, William Penn Troy Sr., at Hillcrest Cemetery outside Mullins, S.C., in May.Allen G. Breed/APhide captionMortician Shawn Troy stands at the grave of his father, William Penn Troy Sr., at Hillcrest Cemetery outside Mullins, S.C., in May.MULLINS, S.C. — When the last mourners departed and funeral director Shawn Troy was left among the headstones, he wept alone.For five decades, the closing words at countless funerals in this town of 4,400 had been delivered by his father, William Penn Troy Sr. Now the elder Troy was gone, one of many Black morticians claimed by a pandemic that has taken an outsized toll on African Americans, after months of burying its victims.And as Shawn Troy stepped forward to speak in place of a man well known beyond his trade — for his work in county politics and advocacy of its Black citizens — the emptiness felt overwhelming. Not just his family, but his community, had lost an anchor."I walked over to his grave and I could hear him talking to me," Shawn Troy said, his own voice breaking as he recalled kneeling beside the plot last September, on a low rise near two palmetto trees. "And he said, 'You got it. You can do it. This is what you were built for.' He passed the baton on to me, so I've got to get running."He is hardly alone. Since the start of the pandemic, about 130 Black morticians have died from COVID-19, according to the association that represents them.Deaths of funeral workers are not closely tracked. But the National Funeral Directors Association, which represents the broader industry, said it has not seen a corresponding rise in COVID deaths among its members.The deaths of Black morticians are particularly notable because of the prominent role they have long played in many communities. Often admired for their success in business, a number have been elected to political office, served as local power brokers, and helped fund civil rights efforts.At the same time, the "homegoing" services they arrange have frequently served as communal touchstones, events as much about life as death, that draw mourners together with pageantry, preaching and song.Black funerals are "more celebration, and that's no disrespect to my colleagues across the country. We're more, I should say, intimate," said Hari P. Close, president of the National Funeral Directors & Morticians Association and the operator of a Baltimore funeral home. The association represents Black morticians.When the pandemic hit, the very closeness and celebration that distinguish Black funerals put morticians at risk, Close said.Their deaths have left some successors struggling to fill their role."It has really had an impact ... particularly in African American funeral homes," he said.The deaths have come despite concerted efforts by morticians to protect themselves from the virus and limits imposed on the size and scope of burial gatherings to keep it from spreading.A photo of the late William Penn Troy Sr. stands on an easel during a ceremony in Mullins, S.C., in May, to dedicate a local road in his honor.Allen G. Breed/APhide caption"This year was unlike any other year I've ever lived through in the funeral service," said Edith Churchman, the fourth-generation owner of a mortuary in Newark, N.J. that serves a largely Black clientele.Dealing with an onslaught of COVID deaths, at first with limited personal protective equipment, and later with shortages of caskets and prepared burial plots, put pressure on funeral directors that far exceeded the demands at the peak of the AIDS epidemic, she said."We were getting bombarded with COVID bodies," said Dr. Mary Gaffney, who stepped in to run her brother, Jeremiah's, funeral home in Inwood, New York after he died of the virus last May.At least 95,000 Black Americans have died of COVID, according to an AP analysis of data from the National Center for Health Statistics, perishing at the highest rate of any racial group in the U.S.Adjusting the figures to account for age differences shows that Blacks, Latinos and Native Americans are two to three times more likely to die of the virus than white people, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."Of course ... you feared for your own safety," Churchman said. "You're kind of dangling on that precipice, saying what if?"In Mississippi, Luzern "Sonny" Dillon and employees at his two funeral homes worked for months to fulfill COVID safety protocols, restricting gatherings. But Dillon, a widely known former councilman, continued his routine of spending time in the community, engaging people in conversation."People would be like, 'You know, Mr. Sonny,' and they'd just begin to talk and share things with him. It was just like a given," his wife, Georgia Dillon, said.In one of those conversations, early this year, a restaurant manager confided to Dillon that he'd lost three family members to COVID in a matter of weeks. The mortician extended his condolences, reassuring the man that, contrary to what some people said, the pandemic was very real. Those words proved prescient.A few weeks later, a funeral home employee tested positive, followed soon after by both of the Dillons."Just in case I don't make it out of here, this is what I want you all to do," Sonny Dillon told his wife from a hospital bed in March. He died weeks later at 72.Georgia Dillon, a nurse, had long helped keep financial ledgers for the business. But her husband was the unquestioned consoler-in-chief and she and other family members scrambled to keep the funeral homes, in McComb and Tylertown, running in his absence.But there was little filling the role that Sonny Dillon occupied beyond the mortuary. In his 20s, he had been one of the first Black candidates elected to local political office. Later, he worked with the daughter of Martin Luther King Jr. to rename a boulevard for the slain civil rights leader. He pushed to get more Black citizens to vote.A tin plaque marks the grave of William Penn Troy Sr. at Hillcrest Cemetery outside Mullins, S.C.Allen G. Breed/APhide captionDillon's civic role fit a pattern common in many African American communities, where morticians have long been prominent, said Suzanne E. Smith, a professor at George Mason University who authored a book about the Black funeral business.The best known include the Ford family of Memphis, Tennessee, funeral home operators who sent a father and son to Congress. In Detroit, funeral director Charles Diggs Sr. was a state legislator before his son won a seat in Washington and helped found the Congressional Black Caucus.In cities throughout the South, funeral directors often supplied the limousines for visiting civil rights leaders when they came to rally supporters."There's all this stuff going on in (Black) funeral homes that is not about burying the dead, but servicing the living," Smith said.By late this summer, Georgia Dillon was preparing to turn over the business to her daughter and son-in-law. Working together with employees at the funeral homes, the family is determined to maintain the business as Sonny Dillon would have run it."We talk and we cry and we try to build each other up. We tell each other we've got to keep his legacy going," she said.In New York, Gaffney is trying to do much the same, but after years away from the funeral business.During the first months of the pandemic, Gaffney said she warned her brother, who had some chronic health issues, to isolate himself and let employees at the funeral home care for the bodies of the dead. But that was not his character.The funeral home, started by the Gaffneys' parents in the early 1970s, had long served mostly African American families in the city neighborhoods and suburban towns near John F. Kennedy International Airport.But after the gregarious Jeremiah took over from his father, a staid retired Army officer, he worked to broaden the clientele, speaking French to some families and hiring staff who spoke Spanish and African languages to others."In the mortuary business you've got to really be in the community," Mary Gaffney said. "That was his thing. He was grass roots. He never met a stranger."While Jeremiah Gaffney ran the family business, Mary Gaffney studied medicine, setting up a practice in Charlotte, North Carolina. After her brother fell ill over the Easter weekend of 2020 and then was diagnosed with COVID, she tried to ensure his care. But his death weeks later, at 65, confronted Mary Gaffney with responsibilities well beyond her expertise.Funeral director Shawn Troy stands for a portrait at Hillcrest Cemetery outside Mullins, S.C.Allen G. Breed/APhide captionWith deaths soaring, she rented a refrigerated trailer to handle the overload. In the New York City neighborhood a few blocks from the funeral home, COVID has killed more than 500 people, double the citywide average."I don't think it slowed. I think I just sped up," said Gaffney, who hired a second funeral director, supplementing one already working in New York, to help her coordinate operations from Charlotte. Every other week, Gaffney drove between the cities to take on the responsibilities her brother had left behind.But she declined offers to sell, feeling that would betray the legacy of her parents and the grandparents who funded its founding. And she has embraced the role her brother once filled as the face of the business, taking calls from grieving families at all hours. Just getting through a year without her brother to tell her what to do feels like crossing a finish line, she said."We're going to see what the future holds," said Gaffney, who hopes younger family members might eventually seek a place in the business. "Needless to say, it's been an emotional journey."South Carolina's Troy has faced somewhat different challenges, taking over the mortuary business founded by his father in 1973 after years of working alongside him."The thing about me and my dad was, we woke up together, we came to work together and then went home and ate together and talked late at night," he said.The Troys had agreed that Shawn would take over the business during the next few years. But he had expected to do so with his father's counsel. The void left by the senior Troy's death extends well beyond the chapel.Over the years, the elder Troy, known as Penn, had served as a county commissioner, local school board member and church treasurer. But those were just his official duties."If my mother didn't have enough to feed us, he'd help us out. When you're talking about Mr. Penn, he was the community," said Jessica Godbolt, a former neighbor whose family gathered recently for the funeral of her uncle.Penn Troy used jokes and small talk to win people over and get things done, said Cynthia Leggette, a school board member and longtime friend.When officials voted to close a school because of declining enrollment, Troy pushed to turn it into a science and technology academy that quickly drew more students, she said. Noting that a citizens committee lobbying for school improvements was overwhelmingly white, Troy made calls that brought Black parents into the fold."Growing up in the 60s, Penn knew what struggle was," Legette said. "He would tell me, 'Cynthia, we have been blessed ... so it's up to us to lift the torch and light the way for our children'."In recognition, officials gathered recently under a tent at Mullins' edge to name a stretch of U.S. 76 the William Penn Troy Highway. Directly across the road, a digital sign flashed a welcome to motorists: "For Your Safety and Ours, Please Wear a Mask."Last summer, both Troys were diagnosed and hospitalized with COVID. The elder Troy never returned home. And two weeks after his father's burial, Shawn Troy presided over the first funeral without him.The early months were the hardest. Penn Troy's charisma gave life to the business of death. Shawn Troy had mostly worked behind the scenes. He recently declined an invitation to get involved in civic affairs, at least for now, preferring to focus on his new role.Standing in the chapel recently on the evening before a funeral, he greeted mourners by name, placing his arm around several shoulders."You doing all right?" he asked from behind his mask. "I haven't seen you in a while."But returning again and again to run funerals at the cemetery where his father is buried is a constant reminder that he is doing so alone.Near sunset recently, Troy paced down a row of headstones, planting tiny flags at an empty plot to mark it for a burial the following morning. Not 50 feet away, lengthening shadows stretched across his father's grave."I don't think I'll ever get over it," he said. "But I'll get through it."
   
The Associated PressAfter more than 500 days with COVID restrictions, Denmark's high vaccination rate has enabled the country to become one of the first European Union nations to lift all domestic restrictions.Claus Bech/Ritzau Scanpix via APhide captionAfter more than 500 days with COVID restrictions, Denmark's high vaccination rate has enabled the country to become one of the first European Union nations to lift all domestic restrictions.COPENHAGEN, Denmark — After 548 days with restrictions to limit the spread of COVID-19, Denmark's high vaccination rate has enabled the Scandinavian country to becomeone of the first European Union nationsto lift all domestic restrictions.The return to normality has been gradual, but as of Friday, the digital pass — a proof of having been vaccinated — is no longer required when entering night clubs, making it the last virus safeguard to fall.More than 80% of people above the age of 12 have had the two shots."I wouldn't say it is too early. We have opened the door but we have also said that we can close it if needed," Soeren Riis Paludan, a professor of virology with the Aarhus University in Denmark's second largest city, told The Associated Press.As of midnight, the Danish government no longer considers COVID-19 "a socially critical disease." Health Minister Magnus Heunicke said Aug. 27 that "the epidemic is under control" but warned: "we are not out of the epidemic" and the government will act as needed if necessary.Jens Lundgren, a professor of viral diseases at the Copenhagen University Hospital said the government would be "quite willing" to reintroduce restrictions if infections spike again. He pointed at night clubs being the last thing to open because "it is the activity associated with the highest risk of transmission.""The world is in the middle of a pandemic and none of us can claim that we are beyond the pandemic," said Lundgren who described Denmark as being "an isolated island" where the vaccine rollout has worked."Nobody should have the illusion that we are over this."The tipping point in Denmark to start easing restrictions came when a majority in the age group of 50+ had the two shots, Riis Paludan said.Since Aug. 14, a face mask on public transportation is no longer mandatory. On Sept. 1, night clubs reopened, limits on public gatherings were removed and it was no longer mandatory to show the pass when one wanted to be seated inside restaurants, or go to soccer games, fitness centers or hairdresser.However, the face mask or shield are still mandatory at airports and people are advised to wear one when at the doctor's, test centers or hospitals. Distancing is still recommended and strict entry restrictions still apply for non Danes at the borders. The outbreak is still considered "an ordinary dangerous illness.""The ghost of corona sits in the back of our head," said Frank Oestergaard, a patron in a downtown Copenhagen restaurant.After more than a year, several European countries are starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel, but with caveats. Some have lifted restrictions but will introduce a vaccination passport. Others expect to do so soon. And in some places, there are few restrictions and they are not respected.On July 19, the British government lifted remaining legal restrictions for England, though it still plans to introduce a vaccination passport for entry into nightclubs and other crowded venues at the end of September.In Denmark's neighbor Sweden, which has stood out among European nations for its comparatively hands-off response to the pandemic, the government said earlier this month that most restrictions, including the ceiling for private and public gatherings and the advice to work from home, will be removed as of Sept. 29.The Scandinavian country has not gone into lockdowns or closed businesses, relying instead on citizens' sense of civic duty to control infection. According to official figures, 70% of people over the age of 15 have gotten both shots and nearly 82 % have received the first shot.And despite a surge, most of the Balkan countries practically have no restrictions, and those which are in place are not respected.In late May, the Danish government presented the passport app featuring a QR code and a green bar if the person has been vaccinated twice or recently tested negative. A paper version also was available. People either had to scan the code or flash it before entering an airport, a harbor, a train station, a hairdresser or an eatery.While in many European countries there were pockets of resistance such passes, people used it all the time in Denmark because people trust authorities, Riis Paludan said.Armed with their pass, people were able to get a haircut, have a drink with friends or attend a cultural event. "It was getting one's freedom back instead of having to sit at home in isolation," laughed Oestergaard."I think it's very good, so hopefully we can get back to a normal day in the restaurant business without checking people and just no restrictions whatsoever. That's nice," said cafe owner Ralph Marker.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Vanessa RomoThe CDC's new research found that those who were vaccinated were nearly five times less likely to get infected, 10 times less likely to get so sick they ended up in the hospital and 11 times less likely to die.Chandan Khanna/AFP via Getty Imageshide captionThe CDC's new research found that those who were vaccinated were nearly five times less likely to get infected, 10 times less likely to get so sick they ended up in the hospital and 11 times less likely to die.Unvaccinated people are 11 times more likely to die from COVID-19 than those who are fully vaccinated, new research has found, bolstering evidence that the inoculations continue to provide powerful protection, even against the delta variant.Thelatest studiesfrom the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released on Friday also found that vaccinated people were nearly five times less likely to get infected and 10 times less likely to get so sick they ended up in the hospital.The CDC "looked at COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths in 13 states and offers further evidence of the power of vaccination," Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the CDC,said at a White House COVID-19 briefingon Friday."As we have shown, study after study, vaccination works," she added.However, the studies — which analyzed data from 600,000 Americans between April 4 and July 17 — suggest that the effectiveness of the vaccines may have dropped as the delta variant became dominant. One explanation could be waning immunity. A second is that the variant is better at evading the immune system. It also could be some combination of the two factors.Another studyexamining data from nine states from June through August indicated that the Moderna vaccine may be the most effective of the three available in the United States.The research found that across all ages, vaccine effectiveness was "significantly higher" among Moderna vaccine recipients — at 95% — than among Pfizer or  Johnson & Johnson vaccine recipients, with vaccine effectiveness of 80%  and 60%, respectively.As of Friday, White House officials said nearly 75% of eligible Americans — those 12 and older — have gotten at least their first shot, and the CDC reported  about54% of the total population is fully vaccinated.NPR's Rob Stein contributed to this report.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Marc SilverEach week, we answer frequently asked questions about life during the coronavirus crisis. If you have a question you'd like us to consider for a future post, email us atgoatsandsoda@npr.orgwith the subject line: "Weekly Coronavirus Questions." See an archive of our FAQshere.We've been answering coronavirus questions from our audience for over a year, but this past week, I had some questions of my own. While on vacation with my family, I encountered four tricky COVID-19 situations. I really wanted an expert's advice.So I interviewed three COVID-19 specialists:Charlotte Baker, an assistant professor of epidemiology at Virginia Tech;Abraar Karan, an infectious disease doctor at Stanford University; andJill Weatherhead, an assistant professor of adult and pediatric infectious diseases at Baylor College of Medicine. Here's what they had to say about my concerns.While we were on vacation, an unvaccinated child who'd tested negative for the coronavirus a few days earlier came to an outdoor gathering. He wasn't feeling so great. That night, he became ill and tested positive for the coronavirus.My two adult children, who attended the gathering, were directly exposed, albeit briefly. My wife and I did not attend the event but hung out with our kids in a hotel room for a couple of hours immediately after the gathering. None of us were wearing masks.We are all fully vaccinated. But we had so many questions! Should our kids quarantine and then get tested? And what about us? We figured we should avoid seeing our kids until their status is known ... but were we at any risk of coming down with COVID-19?All three experts said our children were at low risk of contracting COVID-19 because of their vaccine status and because the event was outdoors, where airflow does a good job dispersing pathogens. And they were only in close proximity with the little boy for a maximum of 10 minutes or so.Yet the risk is not zero.The experts' recommendations: My kids should mask up when they are in public settings, indoors and outdoors, for three to five days in case they were infected and contagious. They should monitor for any potential COVID-19 symptoms such as fever, chills or sniffles. After that time period, they should get a coronavirus test. By that time, there'd be enough viral load for a test to pick up any possible infection.The experts say it's best to go to a health provider for a PCR test, which detects genetic material of the virus and thus provides more accurate results than the at-home antigen tests, which assess viral load.One of my children was planning to fly home on Monday, two days after the exposure. The experts said that was OK given a) they were vaccinated and b) they'd wear a mask.And what about my wife and me?Karan, the doctor at Stanford, says that even if our children were infected at the gathering, the virus takes a couple of days to incubate before it can be transmitted.So we were basically in the clear. But out of an abundance of caution, we masked up in all public settings (which we do anyway because of our concern about breakthrough infections).Our children waited three days and got tested. The results: negative! That gave my wife and me additional reassurance that we had no worries from the incident, so we could resume contact.But what if our children were not vaccinated? Then it would have been a different story. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends an unvaccinated person — whose chances of getting infected and thus being contagious are greater than those who are vaccinated — should quarantine at home for 14 days after an exposure.There were other moments of concern during our stay that had nothing to do with the little boy who had COVID-19. We were staying at a hotel. My wife and I got on an elevator, which had a sign on the door stating: "Guests should wear face coverings in the elevator."We had on masks. Two women without masks got on and eyed my mask."Should I put on a mask?" one asked."Well, if you want to, you can," her friend replied.Neither of them wanted to do so.I didn't say anything. And got off at the next elevator stop.I wondered: Should I have spoken up?Karan notes that in a fleeting elevator contact, an individual with a good mask (an N95 or KN95, for example, and not a thin cloth mask) would be unlikely to become either infected or spread the coronavirus.You also have to ask yourself, he says: "Do I think saying something is going to get them to put a mask on?"But there are other perspectives. Baker, the epidemiologist at Virginia Tech, has a medical condition that puts her at higher risk of getting infected and of severe disease. She says she would have either put in a polite request — "Please ma'am, could you put your mask on?" — or left the elevator at the next stop.If you're uncomfortable in an elevator for any reason – unmasked people, too crowded — "you could always get off and take the stairs," adds Weatherhead, the assistant professor at Baylor College of Medicine.There's another issue to consider besides a personal concern about the odds of catching COVID-19. "This is a community-based virus," Weatherhead says. "Unless everybody has buy-in [regarding protective measures], really nobody's going to be safe. Everybody has to do their part."Which brings me to my next situation. ...As I walked down the hallways of the hotel, I was struck by a noticeable mask fact. The housekeepers and other employees walking the halls were all masked. The guests by and large were not.Now it is true that these hotel employees are in contact with a greater number of individuals in the course of their day than guests walking to their rooms.And maybe these unmasked guests are all vaccinated.But maybe some of the employees are not yet vaccinated. "There's a lot of privilege in being able to get vaccinated," Karan notes. For one thing, "you have to be able to take time off."And this hotel is in a state where the virus is currently surging and the vaccination rate is below 50%.So what's the advice? "The idea of masks is they are providing some protection for the [people who are wearing them] and protection for the guests in that hotel or restaurant," Weatherhead says. And if you're in an area with high rates of COVID-19, "Having everybody masking is really important — and not just for service staff."My wife and I were dining at a restaurant with outdoor seating. At a table about 12 feet away sat two gentlemen. One of them noted that my wife and I were both wearing green.We smiled. True!Then he asked, "Do you really think you need to wear that mask outdoors?"I didn't get to answer — a restaurant staffer escorted the two men to a different part of the outdoor dining area because they were smoking in a nonsmoking zone.So what might I have said?Karan says first of all, it would be fine for my wife and me to be unmasked at the outdoor restaurant with no nearby diners. We'd have to take off our masks anyway once our food and drinks arrived.But there's also an argument for masks. He suggests I could have answered: "When you have high rates of transmission of disease with high levels of spread, it makes sense to wear a mask. It can reduce the chance you'll get exposed to the virus or transmit it to others like kids or unvaccinated people."Baker notes, "If you're going to partake in public activities – [going to] shops, restaurants, bars – you have to do a good job of being a good steward, which is being vaccinated, putting on your mask. That shows you're a willing participant in society to help other people."And make sure it's a good quality mask, she says: "I see a people with bedazzled masks and I'm like, 'You're putting holes in it!' "Then again, perhaps a case of COVID-19 is in everyone's future. "The reality is you will be exposed to the virus," Karan says. "Nobody is going to avoid exposure forever." That is problematic for those at high risk of severe disease – and he says he is seeing an increase in breakthrough cases among older people and the immunocompromised that require hospitalization. But if you're vaccinated, "you'll never know — or may have mild symptoms so you think you just had a cold."Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
The Associated PressStudents, some wearing protective masks, arrive for the first day of school at Sessums Elementary School in Riverview, Fla.Chris O'Meara/APhide captionStudents, some wearing protective masks, arrive for the first day of school at Sessums Elementary School in Riverview, Fla.ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. — The on-again, off-again ban imposed by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis to prevent mandating masks for Florida school students amid the ongoing coronavirus outbreak is back in force.The 1st District Court of Appeal ruled Friday that a Tallahassee judge should not have lifted an automatic stay two days ago that halted enforcement of the mask mandate ban.The upshot is that the state could resume its efforts to impose financial penalties on the 13 school boards currently defying the mask mandate ban. Those have included docking salaries of local school board members who voted to impose student mask mandates.The U.S. Department of Education announced Thursday it has begun a new grant program to provide funding for school districts in Florida and elsewhere that lose money for implementing anti-coronavirus practices such as mandatory masks.DeSantis spokesperson Christina Pushaw said in a tweet that the decision means "the rule requiring ALL Florida school districts to protect parents' rights to make choices about masking kids is BACK in effect!"DeSantis has argued that the new Parents Bill of Rights law reserves solely for parents the authority to determine whether their children should wear a mask to school. School districts with mandatory mask rules allow an opt-out only for medical reasons, not parental discretion.Charles Gallagher, attorney for parents challenging the DeSantis ban, said he is "disappointed" by the appeals court decision."With a stay in place, students, parents and teachers are back in harm's way," Gallagher said in a tweet.The back-and-forth legal battles stem from a lawsuit filed by parents represented by Gallagher and other lawyers contending that DeSantis does not have authority to order local school boards to ban mask mandates.Leon County Circuit Judge John C. Cooper agreed in an Aug. 27 order, then on Wednesday lifted a stay that had blocked his ruling from taking effect. The appeals court now has put that stay back in place as the governor seeks a ruling making his mask mandate ban permanent.The appeals judges noted that a stay is presumed when a public officer or agency seeks appellate review of a judicial order."We have serious doubts about standing, jurisdiction, and other threshold matters," the appeals judges wrote in a one-page decision. "Given the presumption against vacating the automatic stay, the stay should have been left in place pending appellate review."In his previous order, Cooper said the overwhelming evidence is that wearing masks provides some protection for children in crowded school settings, particularly those under 12 who are not currently eligible for vaccination. The court battle comes as Florida copes with the highly contagious delta variant of the coronavirus that has overrun hospitals across the state.On the Parents Bill of Rights, Cooper said his previous order follows the law that reserves health and education decisions regarding children to parents unless a government entity such as a school board can show their broader action is reasonable and narrowly tailored to the issue at hand.The next stage of the legal fight will test whether Cooper's conclusions are correct.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Bill ChappellCredit:StoryfulHis story is poignant and sad, and his concerns are widely held — but when Tennessee teenager Grady Knox stood up at a county school board meeting to explain why he wants masks in schools, adults at the meeting mocked and heckled the high school student."This time last year, my grandmother, who was a former teacher at the Rutherford County school system died of COVID because someone wasn't wearing a mask," Knox, who is a junior at Central Magnet School, said at Tuesday night's board meeting.Knox wanted to speak in support of a mask mandate in schools. But he was forced to halt his speech, as his remarks could barely be heard amid the jeering and laughter from people in the audience."Hey guys," board chair Coy Young said as he tried to restore calm. "We're here to act professional."Knox then finished his remarks, which, like many other statements, were met with applause. But the scene quickly made headlines."If they laugh at me about a personal story about my grandmother, that's just disrespectful, I feel," Knox told Nashville TV stationWSMV. "So, I was like shaken a little bit.""It was complete insanity from my perspective," he said.Young issued an apology to Knox atThursday night's board meeting, saying, "It was pretty devastating what happened to that young man at this meeting.""It's been all over the news and I really regret the young man was treated the way he was. We owe him an apology," Young said.On Thursday, Rutherford County Schoolsannouncedthat the board has adopted a "temporary, 30-day mask requirement," which will take effect on Monday. As part of that plan, the board will send a form to parents who choose to opt out of the requirement.You can also see this video on our Instagram.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
The Associated PressKentucky Gov. Andy Beshear speaks about the increases in COVID-19 cases in the state and the opening day of the Kentucky State Legislature special session in Frankfort, Ky., Tuesday, Sept. 7, 2021.Timothy D. Easley/APhide captionKentucky Gov. Andy Beshear speaks about the increases in COVID-19 cases in the state and the opening day of the Kentucky State Legislature special session in Frankfort, Ky., Tuesday, Sept. 7, 2021.FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) — Kentucky lawmakers, many not wearing masks, voted Thursday to scrap a statewide mask mandate in public schools and shifted masking decisions to local school boards, acting in a special session as the state's worst COVID-19 surge threatens to overwhelm hospitals.The GOP-dominated legislature set education policies in response to disruptions caused by the virus, which has forced dozens of school districts to close classrooms. The masking provisions sparked emotional debate on the third and final day of the special session called by the Democratic governor to address the pandemic.Gov. Andy Beshear responded late Thursday night by vetoing portions of the bill nullifying mask mandates for K-12 public schools and child-care centers. Republican lawmakers quickly overrode his vetoes, completing their work to end statewide mask mandates.Lawmakers ended the special session soon after that.Beshear's veto message referred to masks as a "safe and effective way" to combat the spread of COVID-19. The governor previously issued statewide mask mandates and recently said he thought another mask order was needed to confront the current surge.The special session marked a power shift in the state's response to the virus. Throughout the pandemic, Beshear acted unilaterally in setting statewide virus policies, saying his actions saved lives. Republicans branded his actions as overly broad and stringent.The special session comes as Kentucky's hospitals struggle with a record influx of virus cases. Beshear warned Thursday that only 90 adult intensive care beds were available statewide. He noted nearly two-thirds of Kentucky's hospitals face critical staffing shortages, and more than 300 Kentucky National Guard members will be headed to 21 hospitals to assist health care workers."Our hospital situation has never been more dire in my lifetime than it is right now," Beshear said.Working late into the night, Republican lawmakers asserted their newfound dominance in shaping Kentucky's pandemic policies — the result of a state Supreme Court ruling last month. The court cleared the way for laws to take effect limiting the governor's emergency powers to impose virus restrictions. The governor responded by calling the legislature into session.The school-related bill nullified the state school board's requirement that anyone in public K-12 schools wear a mask. It also ended a separate state mask mandate for child-care centers.Another bill winning final passage Thursday night imposed a prolonged ban on any statewide mask mandate, leaving masking decisions up to local governments and businesses. It was part of a broad measure addressing medical staffing, vaccines, tests and treatments related to COVID-19.Beshear also vetoed mask provisions in that bill. Republican lawmakers swiftly overrode that veto as well.The legislature also passed a measure to appropriate more than $69 million in federal funds for pandemic-related efforts. The funds are aimed at increasing COVID-19 testing for health care providers, schools, health departments and correctional facilities. The governor signed that measure into law, his office said.During debate on the schools bill, supporters said mask decisions are best left to local boards, to reflect the will of their communities."This bill will give local control back to the districts — not mandating they do, not mandating they don't," said Republican Sen. Max Wise, the bill's sponsor. "They make the decision of what they think is best for their constituents in their communities."Opponents warned that lifting the mask mandate would put children and school staffs at greater risk of contracting COVID-19. By putting the burden on school boards to decide mask policies, Democratic Sen. Karen Berg said the legislature was abdicating its responsibility."I think you are asking for fights in school board meetings, where parents are going to be intimidated, where school board members are going to be intimidated," Berg said.Sen. Morgan McGarvey, the chamber's top-ranking Democrat, said removing blanket masking protections comes when the delta variant is infecting more young Kentuckians. More than 300,000 Kentucky students aren't old enough to receive COVID-19 vaccinations, he said."This bill ... is really a life-and-death bill," Democratic Sen. Reggie Thomas said. "If we eliminate mask mandates, then we are putting all children and all school personnel at severe risk."In the House, Democratic Rep. Pamela Stevenson warned the virus is so pervasive that the lack of masking requirements in schools would mean that children are going "into the lion's den."Republican Rep. John Blanton countered that the bill removes a "one-size-fits-all" approach."We are not taking masks away from your children today," he said. "Masks are still part of the tools that's provided for each and every school district across this state."Beshear had asked legislators to give him authority to, at a minimum, require masking when COVID-19 infection rates reach high levels.The school measure gives districts more scheduling flexibility to cope with virus outbreaks. It allows local school leaders to limit remote instruction to a particular school, grade or classroom — depending on the extent of the outbreak — instead of closing the entire district. The overriding goal is to keep children in class when possible, Wise said.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Anya KamenetzParents drop their children off for the first day of school in Novi, Mich., on Tuesday.Emily Elconin/Bloomberg/Getty Imageshide captionParents drop their children off for the first day of school in Novi, Mich., on Tuesday.On Thursday, President Biden announced a series of actions aimed at getting control of the surging pandemic. Alongsidenew vaccine requirements for private businesses, he announcednew stepsto encourage K-12 schools to mandate masks for all, require vaccines for employees and step up testing for COVID-19.Coronavirus safety measures like these have become political flashpoints, andnowhere more than in schools. There have beenviolent confrontationsat school board meetingsover mask requirements, and states includingFlorida, Iowa, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee and Utah have alltried to stop districtsfrom requiring masks. This comes as the highly contagious delta variant is causinga rise in cases among young people, and those under 12 are still not eligible for vaccines.The United States has a long tradition of local control and funding of its 13,000-odd school districts. The federal government has limited oversight powers, and provides around 8 %  of total funds spent on public schools. However, the president seems to be leaning heavily on both the carrots and sticks hedoeshave. The actions announced on Thursday include:In addition, Biden's plan calls on states to require vaccines for all school employees. There was no reward or sanction explicitly attached to this effort. For now, the president is simply "asking" states to follow the example of places like California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Washington, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Alana WiseTamara KeithPresident Biden delivers remarks Thursday on his new plan to stop the spread of the delta variant and boost COVID-19 vaccinations.Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Imageshide captionPresident Biden delivers remarks Thursday on his new plan to stop the spread of the delta variant and boost COVID-19 vaccinations.President Biden on Thursday unveiled a series of steps to combat the newly surging pandemic, including the announcement of a forthcoming federal rule that all businesses with 100 or more employees have to ensure that every worker is either vaccinated for COVID-19 or submit to weekly testing for the coronavirus."We're in a tough stretch, and it could last for a while," Biden conceded, as the delta variant of the coronavirus has causedcases, hospitalizations and deaths to rise across the country. But, he added: "We can and we will turn the tide on COVID-19."Speaking from the White House, Biden said the new emergency rule for private sector employers, which will be issued by the Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration, would apply to 80 million workers.In total, he said thesix-pronged strategyhe unveiled Thursday would affect some 100 million Americans.Biden also announced that businesses meeting the 100-worker threshold must give employees paid time off to get themselves or family members vaccinated.Many Republicans quickly condemned Biden's proposed rule as federal overreach.The Republican National Committee on Thursday night announced its plan to sue the Biden administration."Forcing main street to vax or pay a fine will not only crush an economy he's put on life support—it's flat-out un-American," House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif.,wrote on Twitter. "To Joe Biden, force is more important than freedom. Americans won't stand for it."Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt said in a statement: "It is not the government's role to dictate to private businesses what to do. Once again President Biden is demonstrating his complete disregard for individual freedoms and states' rights. As long as I am governor, there will be no government vaccine mandates in Oklahoma."An NPR/PBS NewsHour/Maristpoll last weekfound that 50% of U.S. adults support employers requiring vaccination to return to in-person work, while 44% do not. The poll did not ask about government mandates for businesses.The vaccine mandate rule coming from the federal government, as opposed to being individually enforced, will shield many employers from facing the brunt of potential blowback, said employment lawyer Brett Coburn of firm Alston & Bird."I'm sure there will be a lot of employers who chafe at this for a variety of reasons, but some employers I think may welcome it," he said. "It kind of takes it out of their hands to some extent to say, 'Sorry, OSHA said we have to do this and we have to follow what OSHA tells us.'"The CDC gives us guidelines. OSHA gives us rules. And that's a really important distinction," Coburn said, noting that he has seen a growing number of companies in the last month move toward vaccine requirements.Among the other steps, Biden also announced that federal workers and contractors will be required to be vaccinated for COVID-19, eliminating an optionlaid out in Julyfor unvaccinated employees to be regularly tested instead.White House press secretary Jen Psaki said federal workers would have about 75 days to become fully vaccinated, once Biden signed an executive order later Thursday. She said there would be limited exemptions for religious or medical reasons.Some federal agencies will require proof of vaccination while others will accept attestations, Psaki said. Workers who fail to comply with the requirement will be counseled by their human resources departments, and then will face "progressive disciplinary action," she said.Also announced Thursday, Biden said the Transportation Security Administration would now double the fines for travelers who refuse to wear masks, as public blowups in airports and aboard trains over mask mandates have become afrequent experiencefor employees of the travel industry."If you break the rules, be prepared to pay," Biden said. "And by the way, show some respect. The anger you see on television towards flight attendants and others doing their jobs is wrong. It's ugly."Biden announced that 17 million health care workers at hospitals and other health care settings like dialysis clinics and home health agencies that receive Medicare or Medicaid funding will have to be vaccinated.There will be similar requirements for teachers and staff at the Head Start early education program and other federally funded educational settings, such as schools on military bases.The government also plans to boost access to home tests for COVID-19, buying nearly $2 billion in tests for a variety of settings ranging from shelters to food banks. Walmart, Amazon and Kroger will sell home tests at cost for the next three months, according to the White House plan.The Defense Department plans to send more teams to states where hospitals have reached capacity with COVID patients, and the government also will ship more monoclonal antibody treatments.Biden delivered stern words to America's unvaccinated adults."Many of us are frustrated with the nearly 80 million Americans who are still not vaccinated," he said, adding that "a distinct minority of Americans, supported by a distinct minority of elected officials, are keeping us from turning the corner."About a quarter of U.S. adults have not gotten a vaccine dose, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."My message to unvaccinated Americans is this: What more is there to wait for? What more do you need to see? We've made vaccinations free, safe and convenient," Biden said. "We've been patient, but our patience is wearing thin. And your refusal has cost all of us. So please do the right thing."The speech comes as the United States has already recorded more than 40 million confirmed cases of the virus, with some 650,000 American lives lost as a result, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University.COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths have spiked recently, due in large part to the delta variant, which experts say appears to betwice as transmissibleas the highly contagious original strain. The vast majority of hospitalizations and deaths in the current surge are among the unvaccinated.Biden has overseen ramped-up efforts to combat the virus through vaccinations and mask usage, but vaccine hesitancy — particularlyamong white Republicans— and the politicization of masks have hindered the nation in the fight to stamp out the virus.In his Thursday remarks, Biden also had sharp words for those lawmakers who he said trafficked in politicizing a public health matter."These pandemic politics, as I refer to them, are making people sick, causing unvaccinated people to die," he said. "We cannot allow these actions to stand in the way of protecting the large majority of Americans who have done their part and want to get back to life as normal."Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Andrea HsuUnited Airlines has mandated that all U.S. employees be vaccinated against COVID-19 or face termination. Those granted exemptions will be put on leave.Justin Sullivan/Getty Imageshide captionUnited Airlines has mandated that all U.S. employees be vaccinated against COVID-19 or face termination. Those granted exemptions will be put on leave.In a move to further protect workers and customers from COVID-19, United Airlines has told employees who are seeking religious or medical exemptions to the company's vaccine mandate that even if approved, they will be put on temporary leave starting Oct. 2 while the company works to institute safety measures for unvaccinated employees.Employees granted religious exemptions will be placed on temporary, unpaid personal leave, and those granted medical exemptions will be placed on temporary medical leave, according to an internal memo.The memo does not specify how long the leave will last. Employees in "operational customer-facing roles," including pilots, flight attendants and customer service agents were told, "Once the pandemic meaningfully recedes, you will be welcomed back to the team on active status."Those in non-customer-facing roles, including technicians and dispatchers, will be required to undergo weekly testing for COVID-19 and to wear a mask at all times including outdoors, the memo said.Employees whose requests for exemptions are denied will be terminated if they do not get their first shot by Sept. 27 or are not fully vaccinated within five weeks of the date of their denial notice.United Airlines imposed a vaccine requirement on U.S.-based employees in early August as cases of the delta variant began to soar, becoming the first U.S. airline to mandate a COVID-19 vaccine. Employees are required to upload a vaccine card showing proof of vaccination by Sept. 27, which will mark five weeks since the FDA's full approval of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine.In early August, when United first announced its vaccine mandate, it said about 90% of pilots and 80% of flight attendants were already vaccinated. The company now says more than half of its employees who were unvaccinated on the day of the announcement have since gotten vaccinated.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

There were no medical personnel among them.Tetovo Mayor Teuta Arifi declared three days of mourning for the victims.The prosecutor's office ordered forensic experts to identify the remains, with the process expected to take longer than usual due to special protocols required because the victims were COVID-19 patients.About a dozen people were injured, though the exact figure wasn't immediately available."We saw the explosion and when we came here everything was in flames," said local resident Nexhmedin Haliti. " Firefighters arrived and started to put the fire out, it lasted for 15- 20 minutes. Everything burnt out."Police officers and forensics investigate the site at a burned out makeshift hospital after a fire in North Macedonia's northwestern city of Tetovo.Boris Grdanoski/APhide captionPolice officers and forensics investigate the site at a burned out makeshift hospital after a fire in North Macedonia's northwestern city of Tetovo.Five prosecutors, from Tetovo and Skopje, are working on the investigation into the causes of the fire. Prime Minister Zoran Zaev said in a Facebook post that the blaze followed an explosion at the site. It was unclear what caused the blast, but there was speculation that it was linked to oxygen supplies."We are shocked. It is a tragedy that I can't even explain. Very sad," said local resident Idriz Brahimi. "Those were sick people who couldn't get out. It is a huge catastrophe."Health Ministry officials said the bodies of those who died were transferred to hospitals in the capital Skopje, about 45 kilometers (30 miles) to the east.With less than 30% of the country's roughly 2 million population fully vaccinated, North Macedonia has seen a significant spike in coronavirus infections and deaths since late August.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Selena Simmons-DuffinGetting vaccinated during pregnancy is one of the best ways to make sure your vulnerable newborn benefits from your antibodies to the coronavirus, doctors say.©fitopardo/Getty Imageshide captionGetting vaccinated during pregnancy is one of the best ways to make sure your vulnerable newborn benefits from your antibodies to the coronavirus, doctors say.If you have a baby at home or are expecting one in the next few months, you might be on edge for all sorts of reasons, but particularly because of COVID-19. The delta variant of the coronavirus has turned nearly every community in the country into abright red hot spot of viral infection. Babies can't get vaccinated against COVID-19 yet — and the youngest age included in current vaccine clinical studies is 6 months old.In fact, therate of new cases of COVID-19 among babiesand children younger than 4 years old in the U.S. recently surpassed the rate of new cases among adults older than 65, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (although the number of deaths among the children remains very low)."People were saying 'Oh, kids don't get COVID' — that's really not true," says Dr. Jennifer Shu, a pediatrician in suburban Atlanta. "They are getting it at the same rates as we would expect, based on their [portion of the] population."Shu says she's concerned: "Because they are disproportionately unvaccinated, we are going to see higher [case] numbers from children, as variants like delta take advantage of people who are vulnerable."Here's a guide to the latest science — and some practical advice — on how to protect a new baby from all variants of the coronavirus.There are lots of reasons why OB-GYNs, midwives and infectious disease experts encourage anyone who's pregnantto get vaccinated against the coronavirus, the first reason being this: COVID-19 can makepregnant people especially sick.Then there's this bonus from a pregnant individual's vaccination, saysDr. Flor Muñoz, a pediatric infectious diseases specialist at Texas Children's Hospital and Baylor College of Medicine: Fetuses get a share of the antibodies generated via the placenta."The paradigm of immunizing a pregnant woman so that her newborn and young infant is protected from a disease is an old one," notesDr. Karen Puopolo, who heads the newborn medicine section at Pennsylvania Hospital in Philadelphia and wrote the American Academy of Pediatrics'interim guidance on newborn care amid COVID-19. For example, pregnant people have long been encouraged to getvaccinated against whooping coughso that their bodies generate antibodies that pass to the fetus and protect the baby after birth.There's no particular recommended timing for when to get the COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy, Muñoz says. But because of the timing required with Moderna and Pfizer, with two shots several weeks apart, if you get vaccinated "around the second trimester, you will be protected in the highest period of susceptibility, which is the third trimester."In fact, Puopolo explains, "late in the third trimester, there is an active process so that essentially your body makes it so that there is more antibody in your baby — in terms of the concentration — than there is in you."Muñoz is leading a largestudy funded by the National Institutes of Health called MOMI-VAXto gather lots of data about mothers and infants and vaccination, including measuring the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the mother versus the baby at birth. It will also look into how long these antibodies last and how well they protect the baby from infection. (The study began enrolling volunteers in early July, with plans to follow individuals and their infants for one year after delivery.)It's likely, Muñoz says, that the borrowed antibodies from pregnancy decline over the first couple of months of a child's life.Mothers who have been vaccinated or had prior infections with the coronavirus can also pass along antibodies to their babies through breast milk, which acts like a temporary shield inside the mouth and nose and stomach, Muñoz explains."It's mostly a surface coating, if you will," she says. That coating is helpful since "this is where these respiratory infections go in — from the nose or the mouth of the baby." The details of how and how well that mode of protection works is part of her MOMI-VAX study.To be clear, though, she adds, "compared to the [the quantity of] antibody that babies get through the placenta — so directly into the blood — the contribution of breast milk antibodies is less."That's why Shu in Atlanta is concerned. She says even in her highly vaccinated community, she's seeing many pregnant women who aren't getting vaccinated."I'm seeing too many people who are choosing to wait to get the vaccine until after they've delivered," Shu says, "and they're really relying on some immunity going through the breast milk to protect their baby." Nationally, only about1 in 4 pregnant peoplehad at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine as of the end of August, according to the CDC."With the delta variant being as transmissible as it is, I would really like to see that the moms get the vaccine either before they become pregnant or during their pregnancy," Shu says.Beyond supplying antibodies, which can help babies fight off infection if they get exposed to the virus, parents can avail themselves of other strategies to keep babies from getting exposed in the first place.Many of these tricks have been proven to work against other germs — babies have always been vulnerable to picking up viruses and other pathogens, especially early on. "The first month of a baby's life is really delicate," Shu explains. "In that month, if they get an infection, it can turn serious a lot faster than in older babies."So, although the pandemic is a particularly stressful time to be guarding a newborn's health, "the steps that I would tell a family to take today are not shockingly different than I would have told them 10 years ago," Puopolo says.Bottom line, in regards to the people who are around your baby: "Make every effort to keepthemhealthy," Puopolo advises.In the era of COVID-19, she says, that means "ensuring that anybody — age appropriate — is vaccinated. The parents should be vaccinated; if you have grandparents or a nanny or someone who's in your home helping with child care, make sure they're vaccinated." Siblings who qualify for the shots should get vaccinated, too, she says.Having all of the people around the baby vaccinated acts like a force field. Those people are less likely to get infected, which means they're less likely to bring the virus home."For the most part, what we have learned is that when an infant becomes ill with a respiratory illness, such as flu, COVID or pertussis, it's because they've been in contact with someone in the house [who's sick]," explains Muñoz.Of course, the vaccines are not a perfect shield, so it's smart to use several methods to fight off COVID-19, including having parents, caregivers and siblings wear masks when they're out in public. Keep the home well-ventilated, and frequently wash your hands. And, if your baby is at day care, Puopolo suggests having conversations with staff about whether they're taking those same steps to minimize risks.If someone home with the baby is sick (with any illness, but especially COVID-19), keep them away from the baby as much as possible. "We highly recommend that people who are sick are not around babies — they don't kiss the babies, they don't have very close contact face to face," Muñoz says.If the parent or any direct caregiver gets sick or feels they might be coming down with something and is the only one to care for the infant, Muñoz recommends that theyput on a mask when around the baby, especially if they're symptomatic. "In some cases, it's even been recommended to completely separate the person who's ill — even if it's the mother from the baby — when there is a high risk of transmission," she adds.Life with a newborn is often a mix of harrowing and delightful — and during a pandemic, there's definitely extra stress. Do go for walks with your baby, Shu says, but don't take the baby to big gatherings."You don't want them in large groups of people," she says. "If you want to see guests, you might have them visit outside your house instead of inside. Anyone who wants to hold the baby needs to be healthy, wash their hands and — in this day and age — probably wear a mask."In other words, "stay away from settings where your baby can catch something," Puopolo advises, especially in the baby's first few months.So far, even though the delta variant is much more transmissible than the original coronavirus variant, researchers are still trying to figure out if it causes illness in children and babies that is any more severe."Fortunately, in my practice, the newborns and young infants I've seen who have had COVID have done well — they tend to have cold symptoms and recover," says Shu. "That said, I've seen other infants with a fever lasting for many days from COVID [and] we sometimes see some breathing problems that may require a trip to the hospital."Especially for anyone in the first few months of life, fevers are a red flag, says Puopolo. "You should always call your pediatrician or seek emergency care if a baby has a fever greater than 100.4° Fahrenheit," she says. "In addition to fever, you are worried about how the baby's feeding, how the baby's sleeping." Since infants who are sick don't tend to feed well, they can also get dehydrated, she says."So signs of a cold, signs of a fever, fussiness that can't be resolved, poor feeding — these are, COVID or no COVID, always reasons why you should seek medical care for your infant," says Puopolo.Again, "the risk is low, but it's not zero," Shu says, that babies will develop severe complications from COVID-19.The clinical trials of COVID-19 vaccines currently underway only dip down in age as young as 6 months. But reduced doses of the vaccine might — at some point — be available for younger ages, says Muñoz."If you look at some of theguidance from the FDAfrom very early on in the pandemic, children under 6 months are not excluded," she points out. "So they can be included, it's just that at this time, to my knowledge, there are no studies evaluating vaccines at zero to 6 months of age."Vaccines are evaluated in a stepwise process by age, she explains. "We have been starting with adults and then adolescents and now working on the pediatric age groups," Muñoz says. "It will take some time, because we have to establish safety and efficacy in older groups before we can go down to the newborns and the youngest babies.""So this is something that is not out of the [realm] of possibilities," she says. "But it will also take some time."Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Joe HernandezA student arrives for the first day of classes on Aug. 23 at a public school in Miami Lakes, Fla.Eva Marie Uzcategui/Bloomberg/Getty Imageshide captionA student arrives for the first day of classes on Aug. 23 at a public school in Miami Lakes, Fla.At least 13 employees of the Miami-Dade County Public Schools have died from complications of COVID-19 since Aug. 16, according to district officials.Those who died include teachers, school bus drivers, a security worker and a cafeteria manager."It is a big number. It is a bruising statistic that we need to absolutely internalize," Miami-Dade school Superintendent Alberto M. Carvalhotold NPR'sHere & Now.According to the president of United Teachers of Dade, Karla Hernandez-Mats, all of those who died were African American and unvaccinated.Carvalho said that while the district is blocked by law from requiring employees to be vaccinated against COVID-19 or even asking whether they are vaccinated, he is urging people to get the shot."This sad statistic underscores the impact of misinformation and disinformation efforts through some vocal entities, who quite frankly profess anything but scientific reality," Carvalho said. "The outcome, the consequence is the death of individuals, and that's just not acceptable."The school system — which is the fourth-largest district in the country — will try to increase the vaccination rate among staffers by offering $275 to any employee who shows proof of vaccination.Carvalho said that among the 13 deaths, the majority of people contracted COVID-19 and died before the beginning of the school year. One person had direct contact with students, he said.Miami-Dade students returned to the classroom on Aug. 23 witha requirement that they wear masksas a spike in infections and deaths has continued to plague Florida.The mask mandate was a violation of an order signed by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis barring schools from requiring that students wear face coverings and leaving that decision to their parents.DeSantishas withheld funding from two school districtsthat violated his order, but Carvalho said that Miami-Dade had not yet lost any money.The district hasan online portalthat tracks COVID-19 cases among its employees and staff, and it is continuing to urge all of those who are eligible to get vaccinated.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

Macy's said the 2021 parade will include new precautions as in-person viewing resumes in Manhattan.Eugene Gologursky/Getty Images for Macy's Inc.hide captionThe 94th annual Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade was held in a modified version on Nov. 26 in New York City. Macy's said the 2021 parade will include new precautions as in-person viewing resumes in Manhattan.Because of the pandemic, last year's Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York City was a virtual event — made just for TV — that was held in the one-block stretch in front of the company's flagship store on 34th Street. But this year, the public will be able to watch the parade flow through Manhattan in person,Macy's says.Marking the 95th year ofthe parade, live musical performances will make their return alongside the iconic giant balloons, decorated floats, marching bands, and of course, an appearance by Santa."We are thrilled to welcome back in its full form the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade," New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said in anews release. He said he looks forward to "welcoming back Parade watchers to experience it safely, live and in person this November."While the annual parade is set to march down the streets of Manhattan, city and parade officials said several precautions will be in place to ensure the health and safety of parade viewers and participants.All volunteer participants and staff must be vaccinated against COVID-19 and will be required to wear face coverings and other protective equipment, Macy's said.In order to follow social distancing guidelines along the parade route, Macy's will also cut the overall number of participants (everyone from balloon handlers to marching bands) by up to 20% — or about 1,600. That's down from the normal figure of about 8,000.Last year, parade officials held amodified versionof the event due to the rise of COVID-19 cases across the country, with much of the parade being pretaped over a span of three days for the televised event.It's unclear how many people will line the streets this year to watch the parade, which typically draws 2 million to 3 million spectators along the route. Details on public viewing locations and entry guidelines and restrictions will be announced in November.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Sneha DeyIn a wave of lawsuits in nearly half a dozen states, families of students with disabilities are joining the legal battle over masks in schools. Some parents say it's a matter of life and death for immunocompromised students.Justin Paget/Getty Imageshide captionIn a wave of lawsuits in nearly half a dozen states, families of students with disabilities are joining the legal battle over masks in schools. Some parents say it's a matter of life and death for immunocompromised students.Brittany Schwaigert says her 13-year-old son, Greyson, needs his peers to wear their masks.Greyson has tuberous sclerosis complex, a rare genetic disorder, which means contracting COVID-19 could send him into renal failure among other complications. He is also behind in school due to developmental delays."He doesn't understand that he's in danger and so therefore he doesn't understand he has to [put on a] mask." Schwaigert says. "Those kinds of advanced concepts are out of his grasp. So, it requires everyone around him to protect him."Brittany Schwaigert with her husband, Ryan, 13-year-old Greyson (far right) and 10-year-old Lachlan. Schwaigert is a lead plaintiff in a class action lawsuit challenging the Tennessee governor's opt-out policy on masks.Brittany Schwaigerthide captionBrittany Schwaigert with her husband, Ryan, 13-year-old Greyson (far right) and 10-year-old Lachlan. Schwaigert is a lead plaintiff in a class action lawsuit challenging the Tennessee governor's opt-out policy on masks.He attends school at Collierville Municipal School District in Tennessee. In mid-August, Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee, a Republican,issued an executive orderthat allows parents to opt their children out of mask mandates.As of Aug. 20, 16% of students in Greyson's district were opting out. Schwaigert is a lead plaintiff in a class action lawsuit challenging the governor's opt-out policy. On Friday, a federal judgetemporarily blockedLee's order from being enforced, but that ruling only lasts until Sept. 17.Schwaigert says Greyson can only get the special education services and socialization he needs in the classroom. But the opt-out order, she adds, would put her son in danger when he is at school. "We cannot rely on other people's parenting to protect our special needs child. That's absurd."In a wave of lawsuits in nearly half a dozen states, families of students with disabilities are joining the legal battle over masks in schools. Complaints filed in Tennessee, Florida, Utah, Texas and South Carolina argue that restrictions on mask mandates infringe on disability rights and that children with disabilities are being forced to choose between their health and their education."We hear all the time, 'Oh, only kids with preexisting conditions are the ones that get sick and die,' " Schwaigert says. "Well, that's my kid. That is my child. He has a lot of preexisting conditions, and he matters."The U.S. Department of Education has also said restrictions on mask mandates may be discriminatory against students with disabilities. On Aug. 30, the department's Office for Civil Rights announced itis investigating mask mandate restrictionsin five states, including in Tennessee, Utah and South Carolina.With restrictions on mask mandates in place, disability rights advocates are arguing that students with disabilities are putting their lives at risk to attend school.Parents must "make the impossible decision of deciding whether to pull their children out of in-person learning or risk severe reactions or death as a result of COVID-19," the complaint in Tennessee says.The suits aren't demanding that schools institute a mask mandate. Instead, parents such as Schwaigert want schools to have the capacity to require masks on the basis of regional health metrics."Gov. Lee doesn't take into account that not all children are going to survive this decision," Schwaigert says. "He's making a broad strokes decision for every child in Tennessee."Lee's office did not respond to NPR's request for comment.The federal Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act guarantee that children with disabilities have access to an inclusive public education. They also require schools to provide "reasonable accommodations" to help make that education accessible — and the complaints argue those accommodations can include masks for everyone.A Florida lawsuit was the first to argue that Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis' mask mandate ban is in violation of federal disability rights law. Matthew Dietz, one of the lawyers who filed that lawsuit, says mask mandates meet the benchmarks for a reasonable, necessary accommodation."If they don't get that mask when they go to school, they're at higher risk of death. So yes, it's necessary," Dietz says. "Is it reasonable? It's a piece of cloth, it's not difficult. Would it cause a fundamental alteration or an undue burden to the school system as a total? Not at all."Dietz adds that it's just as reasonable as accommodating peanut allergies, which schools have been doing for years.In a separate lawsuit, a Florida judge has already ruled that DeSantiscannot enforce a ban on mask mandates. Nonetheless, the governor is withholdingmoney from two school districtsthat are requiring face coverings.A spokesperson for DeSantis, who is named in Dietz's suit, told NPR, "The assertion that forced-masking all children ages 2 and up has any impact on school safety vis-a-vis COVID-19 is not data-driven and is not reflective of a scientific consensus."In fact,severalstudieshave shownthat universal masking in schools can reduce the spread of the virus. The Centers for Disease Control and Preventionrecommends indoor masking for everyonein schools, regardless of vaccination status, with the exception of children younger than 2 years old.A court hearing for Dietz's lawsuit over federal disability rights is set for Wednesday.The legal battles over masks come as millions of children are heading back to school.In addition to launching civil rights investigations in states that ban mask mandates, the Education Departmenthas thrown its supportbehind school administrators who choose to ignore those bans. But even then, Dietz says, the federal government has been slow to act."There's no time for investigation," he says. "By the time they do investigations, we're going to have dead children."In Utah, parents are challenging Republican Gov. Spencer Cox over the mask mandate ban in state court, rather than in federal court. Greg Skordas, an attorney on the case, says that with schools starting and children already returning to buildings without masks, they're running out of time.He expects to hear back from the court within the next month. His complaint claims a mask mandate ban is in violation of the Utah Constitution, which guarantees all children access to free and fair public education. But for students with disabilities, he argues in-person school is too dangerous without a mask mandate.A spokesperson for Cox declined to comment on the lawsuit because it is pending litigation."Our case is very much like others that are brought across the country. Some are raised in federal court, some are in state court. But the fundamental provisions are the same," Skordas says. "We have gone so far as to preclude the ability of schools and medical professionals and health care providers to impose masks that effectively a lot of our young people are really in a difficult position."For now, there isn't much that parents of children with disabilities can do except wait and see how the courts rule.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Bill ChappellFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) is "completely incorrect" to suggest vaccines are a personal choice with no broad implications, says Dr. Anthony Fauci (L), the country's top infectious disease authority.J. Scott Applewhite/AP; Stephen M. Dowell/Orlando Sentinel/Tribune News Service via Getty Imageshide captionFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) is "completely incorrect" to suggest vaccines are a personal choice with no broad implications, says Dr. Anthony Fauci (L), the country's top infectious disease authority.Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is "completely incorrect" to suggest vaccines are a personal choice with no broad implications, says Dr. Anthony Fauci, the country's top infectious disease authority."If [DeSantis] feels that vaccines are not important for people, that they're just important for some people, that's completely incorrect," Fauci said after being asked about DeSantis' views duringan interview Tuesday with CNN.Vaccines have been the solution to public health crises such as smallpox, polio and measles, Fauci said — but they rely on wide adoption to work, he added."When you're dealing with an outbreak of an infectious disease, it isn't only about you," Fauci said. "There's a societal responsibility that we all have."DeSantis saidin a news conference Fridaythat vaccines help people to avoid severe illness from COVID-19. But instead of saying everyone who's eligible should be vaccinated, the governor added a caveat."At the end of the day though, it's about your health and whether you want that protection or not," DeSantis said. "It really doesn't impact me or anyone else."In response to DeSantis' comments, Fauci said on Tuesday: "Yeah, that's not true at all."Aside from the personal benefit of being protected against the coronavirus, Fauci said, "When you have a virus that's circulating in the community and you are not vaccinated, you are part of the problem. Because you're allowing yourself to be a vehicle for the virus to be spreading to someone else.""So it isn't as if it stops with you," the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said, adding that if an unvaccinated person becomes infected, they could pass the coronavirus on to older people or those who are otherwise more vulnerable.DeSantis has taken a number of controversial positions on the coronavirus, including working to block mask and vaccine mandates at local levels and in school districts, even as Florida endures a precipitous rise in COVID-19 cases.The number of children being hospitalized with COVID-19 in Florida "has increased more than tenfold" to reach alarming new levels,NPR member station WFSUreported last week.The governor's recent remarks about the vaccine and personal choice also sparked sharp criticism from theMiami Herald, which called the sentiments both incredible and wrong."Doesn't impact anyone else?" the newspaper asked in an editorial. "Talk about a profile in selfishness."Florida has watched its number of cases, deaths and hospitalizationsskyrocket to new heightsthis summer, putting additional stress on hospital systems and medical staff."This is still an outbreak, a pandemic of the unvaccinated," Faucisaid Tuesday on NPR. "And when you look at the percentage of cases, particularly those that wind up with severe consequences leading to hospitalization, it is overwhelmingly among the unvaccinated."DeSantis' net approval rating recently fell 14 percentage points, according to theFlorida Politicswebsite, which noted that despite the overall drop among voters, 83% of Republicans still approve of the job the governor is doing.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Fran KritzWith all the talk about COVID-19 vaccines and boosters, it's easy to forget that another dangerous respiratory virus is poised to strike — the flu.Experts worry that wecould be heading into a big flu season, especially if enough Americans do not get their annual flu shot, which is now widely available."We are worried the incredibly low influenza rates that we saw last seasoncould create a rebound influenza epidemic this year," saysDr. Mark Roberts, director of thePublic Health Dynamics Laboratoryat the University of Pittsburgh.Most years as many as 12,000 to 52,000 people die from the flu in the U.S. But the unusually mild flu season last year means that fewer people have immunity to strains likely to be circulating this winter. That could lead to anywhere from 100,000 to 400,000 additional hospitalizations for influenza, according totwo recent computer modeling studiesdone by Roberts and his colleagues."It could be really bad — and it could be really bad at a time when there's still quite a bit of COVID-19 filling up our hospitals," he says.Getting the flu shot remains the single most powerful action a person can take to fend off the days- or weeks-long, wracking muscle aches, fever andsometimes deadly respiratory infection that is influenza."Two reasons make getting vaccinated against the flu the wise choice," saysDr. William Schaffner, medical director of the National Foundation of Infectious Diseases. "First, it's been proven year after year that you're in better shape to fight off the flu if you get the vaccine. Second, by getting vaccinated against the flu, you help protect the people around you."Here's a guide to getting yourself vaccinated against the potentially fatal virus.I heard that the flu essentially disappeared last year. Do I really need a flu shot this year?Yes. Last year sawa record-low number of flu cases, likely thanks to widespread mask wearing, remote work and school, and physical distancing. But this year, experts fear that the reopening of schools, decreased adherence to pandemic precautions and surging delta variant infections could create a double whammy: a very serious flu and COVID-19 season. Already, cases ofRSV, yet another serious respiratory virus in children, are spiking. "This suggests that flu will be back [too]," saysL.J Tan,executive director of theImmunization Action Coalition.Who should get a flu shot?Anyone 6 months and older, unless your doctor has specifically recommended that you not get a flu shot because of a prior, rare, severe reaction, says Dr. Lisa Grohskopf, a medical officer in the influenza division at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.When's the best time to get the flu shot?Why not now?Flu season starts in October in the U.S. While there's some concern that immunity might wane before the end of flu season in May if you get the vaccine too early, there's not enough data to know the optimal time to get the shot, Grohskopf says.The CDC says aim to get your flu vaccine by the end of October. By then, cases will have started to mount, and many people will be just a few weeks away from travel for Thanksgiving and Christmas. That said, "getting vaccinated at any time during the flu season [can] still be beneficial," says Dr.Andrew Pavia,chief of pediatric infectious diseases at the University of Utah Health.Will the flu vaccine definitely keep me from getting the flu?No. No vaccine is 100% effective. But if you do get the flu, the vaccine is likely to reduce your chance of getting very sick, being hospitalized or dying, Pavia says. Before last year,tens of thousands of peoplewere hospitalized or died from the flu each year, usually people who weren't vaccinated.Can I get the flu and COVID-19 vaccines at the same time?Absolutely. The CDC had previously recommended spacing out the timing of the COVID-19 vaccine and other immunizations because the vaccines were so new, but "that guidance has changed," says Grohskopf. The CDC now says it's safe to get both vaccines at once, she says. "The body's immune response and side effects are generally the same as when getting one vaccine alone." If you do get two shots on the same day, expect to get each vaccine in a different arm, which may reduce any pain and swelling that might occur.What about my COVID-19 booster shot — can I get that at the same time as my flu shot?Right now, third doses of COVID-19 vaccine are authorized for many people. If you qualify, you can get that extra dose and the flu shot on the same day.The delta variant is making me anxious about going to the doctor's office or pharmacy for a flu shot this year. Are there other choices?If you're concerned, aim for an off hour and call to make sure the provider (as well as you) will be masked. If you're still worried, check with local clinics to see if there are any outdoor flu shot clinics in your area.How do I make sure I get the right flu shot for me and my family?"While the most important thing is to get any flu shot, there are some specialized flu shots for specific groups," says Pavia. The key is usually age.Kids 8 and younger who are getting the flu shot for the first time need two doses, given a month apart, saysDr. Flor Munoz-Rivas,a pediatric infectious disease specialist at Baylor College of Medicine. Strong immunity doesn't kick in until two weeks after the second shot, "so parents should be scheduling these shots now," she says.Immune systems weaken with age. That's why the CDC recommends that adults 65 and older get vaccinated with one of two souped-up flu shots: either the Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent vaccine or the FLUAD Quadrivalent vaccine. Both are designed to elicit a more robust immune response. If neither is available, then any flu shot is a good choice.I'm pregnant. Should I get a flu shot?Yes. And if you're in your third trimester, the CDC advises you get a flu shot ASAP so you can pass on the protection to your newborn from Day 1. "Babies can't get the flu shot until they are 6 months old but are protected by their mother's antibodies from a flu shot — if she gets the shot — until 6 months, when they can get their own flu vaccine," says Grohskopf. Just be sure to get the shot, not the nasal spray.I have an allergy to eggs and heard I can't get a flu shot. Is that true?Not really, says the CDC's Grohskopf.It's true that most flu shots and one nasal spray flu vaccine approved by the Food and Drug Administration are manufactured using egg-based technology, so they contain a small amount of egg proteins. But studies of both the nasal spray and the shots found that allergic reactions are very rare.Two egg-free vaccines are available: Flublok Quadrivalent (for people 18 and older) and Flucelvax Quadrivalent (which is approved for age 2 and up this season). But the CDC says people with a history of egg allergy can get any licensed, age-appropriate flu vaccine. If you have a history of severe allergic reaction to eggs, the CDC recommends you get your shot at a location where the staff can treat you if a rare allergic reaction does occur.I'm willing to take my chances, so why should I get the flu vaccine?With the pandemic still raging, skipping the flu shot is a much riskier proposition, says Dr.Bernard Camins,an infectious disease physician at the Mount Sinai Health System in New York City. "You could get the flu and need care but find hospitals overwhelmed because of COVID, or get the flu and get COVID. And especially if you are not vaccinated against the coronavirus, [you] run the risk of your immune system being overwhelmed by two viruses at the same time." Getting back-to-back infections could result in more serious illness, since the first infection may have already weakened your lungs, saysDr. Priya Nori, an infectious disease specialist at Albert Einstein College of Medicine.If I'm already vaccinated against COVID-19, does getting the flu shot mean I'm doubly protected and no longer have to wear a mask?Not at all. "Don't stop the public health measures," says Pavia. Distancing, wearing a mask and washing your hands, especially after coughs and sneezes, can improve the chances that you and others will not get the flu — or COVID-19.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Will StoneIn Idaho, a record number of people are hospitalized with COVID-19, raising the possibility of rationing medical care. Many states are grappling with the fallout of the delta variant's surge in cases.Kyle Green/APhide captionIn Idaho, a record number of people are hospitalized with COVID-19, raising the possibility of rationing medical care. Many states are grappling with the fallout of the delta variant's surge in cases.The U.S. health care system is again buckling under the weight of a COVID-19 surge that has filled more than 100,000 hospital beds nationwide and forced some states to consider enacting "crisis standards of care" — a last resort plan for rationing medical care during a catastrophic event.The idea is an alarming sign of how the delta variant has ripped through large swaths of the country — primarily sickening the unvaccinated and straining an already depleted health care workforce.In recent weeks, more than 10 states have reached their highest hospital admissions for COVID-19 of the pandemic, from the Southeast to the Pacific Northwest. And the U.S. continues to average more than 160,000 new coronavirus cases a day."We're in a very dangerous place, given the level of our surge," saysDr. Bruce Siegel, president of America's Essential Hospitals, a trade group that represents hundreds of public hospitals."We are right on the edge of entering crisis standards of care. I hope we don't get to that point, but it could very easily happen," Siegel says. This is essentially a road map for how to divvy up medical care in a way that's equitable when resources are tight.While there are national guidelines for crisis standards, the actual plans can vary depending on the state, region or institution. Declaring crisis standards does not necessarily mean patients will be denied care altogether, but it does give hospitals flexibility about whom to prioritize and provides legal protection for doctors.For example, certain patients deemed less likely to survive may not get a bed in the intensive care unit. Nurses may be asked to treat many more patients than is normally considered safe. Patients may have to be discharged from the hospital before they would normally go home, and some patients who would usually be admitted for hospital care might have to be denied.Arizona had to activate its plan earlier in the pandemic. And some states came to the brink of doing so last winter. These plans can include a"scoring" system that evaluates a patient's chance of survivalbased on the functioning of the brain, heart, kidneys or other major organs.And even if states narrowly avoid this worst-case scenario, doctors in hard-hit regions say the sheer stress on hospitals is inevitably affecting patient care in ways that are painfully reminiscent of last winter, when the U.S. peaked at more than 120,000 hospitalizationsNurses overwhelmed. ICU patients being housed in the emergency room. Doctors scouring the state for the last bed. These are scenes that critical care doctor Kenneth Krell never expected to deal with in late 2021, once highly effective vaccines for COVID-19 were widely available."It's worse than ever, with — at this point — seemingly no end in sight," says Krell, who helps run an ICU in eastern Idaho. "So by no means are we delivering a usual and customary standard of care."In Idaho, the Republican Gov. Brad Little has called in the National Guard and federal health care workers to help short-staffed hospitals with logistics and staffing in an effort to avoid activating crisis standards of care.If the crisis standards are enacted, doctors will start making decisions about "who gets the most immediate care by their probability of survival," with the goal of "saving the most lives," says Krell. This would apply to COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients alike, he says."There's a huge downside," Krell says. "We're going to create panic in the state, in that people will decide they can't get care."As was the case earlier in the pandemic, it's trained health care workers — not ventilators or physical space — that are the key limited resource. In fact, many hospitals have even fewer nurses, respiratory therapists and doctors now than they had on staff during last winter's surge."The staffing crisis is the worst it has been," says Siegel of America's Essential Hospitals. Health care systems have hundreds of vacancies that can't be filled, even if they pay top wages because "people just aren't there anymore."On top of that, for many hospitals, there was no letup after last winter's COVID-19 surge; they stayed busy, he says, because there were so many patients coming in for delayed care.In Alabama, Republican Gov. Kay Iveydeclared a state of emergencylast month because of the surge in serious COVID-19 cases. "It has really impacted and fragmented all of health care right now," saysDr. Aruna Arora, president of the Medical Association of the State of Alabama."Everyone is short nurses," Arora says. "EMS response times are a lot slower. Patients are having to wait in the ER for a long period of time."Even if a hospital never has to activate its crisis care protocol, it is crucial to be ready with such a plan, saysDr. Eric Toner, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security who has helped design guidance on crisis standards for states and health care systems."In the absence of a declaration or a plan, doctors and nurses, on their own, are the only ones left to make these gut-wrenching decisions," Toner saysIt's worse than ever, with — at this point — seemingly no end in sightKenneth Krell, critical care doctor, IdahoEverything should be done to avoid moving to crisis standards, says Toner, but he worries that many places right now are in "chaos," struggling to do the kind of coordination necessary to keep this worst-case scenario at bay,"We have individual doctors calling other hospitals, even out of state, trying to transfer patients — that should not be happening," he says. "We're not balancing patients enough between hospitals. We're not sharing resources as well as we should."In New Mexico, the surge has led to ICU waiting lists and state health officials have warned they might have to employ crisis standards of care soon if the trajectory of infections simply stays the same, let alone rises.But at least some hospitals in the state do feel better equipped to handle the surge than they did last winter.Dr. Jason Mitchell, the chief medical officer for New Mexico's largest health care system, Presbyterian, says he's "optimistic" hospitals will not have to implement their crisis plans because they've gained a lot of experience managing the pressures of COVID-19 in the last year.We were all saying, including most hospitals, 'Let's be ready for winter because of flu and COVID.' Well, it hit us before that.Ali Mokdad, University of Washington"We've been able to work through this phase of the pandemic and still maintain that standard of care," he says. "That means people work harder, they work longer."Other states may be catching a break, too.According to the latest modelingfrom the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, some of the hardest-hit states may have reached their peaks in hospitalizations and cases, especially in parts of the South like Florida and Texas.But in many other parts of the country, hospitalizations are likely to keep increasing, the researchers say, with the U.S. projected to hit a peak of about 116,000 people in the hospital by mid-September.According to the model, ICU capacity will be under "extreme stress" in states like Tennessee, Kentucky, Indiana, Hawaii, Georgia, Delaware and Wisconsin.Ali Mokdad, part of the University of Washington team, says it's understandable that some hospitals in the U.S. are particularly struggling right now. Many Americans are still unvaccinated, and the delta variant has changed the dynamic in the U.S."Nobody expected a surge in summer. We expected the surge in winter," says Mokdad. "And we were all saying, including most hospitals, 'Let's be ready for winter because of flu and COVID.' Well, it hit us before that."Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Ari ShapiroElena BurnettAmy IsacksonNurses work at a COVID-19 testing day for students and school faculty at Brandeis Elementary School on in Louisville, Ky.Jon Cherry/Getty Imageshide captionNurses work at a COVID-19 testing day for students and school faculty at Brandeis Elementary School on in Louisville, Ky.Not long ago, Denver Public Schools nurse Rebecca Sposato was packing up her office at the end of a difficult school year. She remembers looking around at all her cleaning supplies and extra masks and thinking, "What am I going to do with all this stuff?"It was May, when vaccine appointments were opening up for the majority of adults and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were loosening mask guidance."I honestly thought we were trending down in our COVID numbers, trending up in our vaccine numbers," she says. "And I thought the worst was over."Now, four months later, the pandemic is already upending the new school year across the country, as the highly transmissible delta variant continues to cause a spike in cases. In Arizona, coronavirus outbreaks are forcingthousands of children and teachers to quarantine. In Georgia, many districts that began classes in-person without mask mandatesswitched back to remote learningafter the virus spread. And in Oregon, some districts delayed the start of the school year afterteachers were exposed to possible infection.School nurses are tasked with caring for the health and safety of children at schools, and managing a third school year in a pandemic has put even more strain on those in a professionalready facing staffing shortages.Katherine Burdge is a school nurse in Tampa, Fla., where classes started at the beginning of August amid a struggle between school districts and Gov. Ron DeSantis, whothreatened to cut state funding for public schoolsthat required students and staff to wear masks.A judge ruled thatDeSantis' executive order banning mask mandates was unconstitutional, but Burdge says school nurses are "dealing with the repercussions" of the back and forth. Her district of Hillsborough County had toisolate or quarantine more than 13,000 students and staffin just the last month — over 2,500 of whom tested positive for the coronavirus."We're dealing with COVID on the front lines every day," she says. "It's a serious manifestation that is just overwhelming the district, the state, everybody."Eileen Gavin, a school nurse in Monmouth County, N.J., also says it's been overwhelming and cites a beat up and faded "Parking For School Nurses Only" sign as a visual representation for how she and other school nurses are feeling."It's kind of likeGroundhog Day: another year of contact tracing and vaccinating and kind of leading the kids back to school safely," Gavin says. "So, I do think we are traumatized."Gavin says nurses continue to show up and do their jobs, but are feeling the strain of a workload that has expanded beyond what they could have predicted."It really is a lot to bear," she says. "We are the only healthcare professional in the schools and we have input and weigh in on so many things."Gavin says she spends a lot of time talking with parents to help them sift through "the noise and the misinformation and give them valid resources" on dealing with the coronavirus."We assist in giving them the information so they can make an informed decision to keep their child healthy and safe," she says.Burdge, who's also the President-elect of Florida's School Nurses Association, similarly says that school nurses want to be a resource for parents, but that the fight over masks between public officials in her state has caused some grief."We don't want to have those nasty words or fights or debates or anything along those lines with them," Burdge says. "We are a resource for them, and open communication, I think, is key at this point."Sposato says that where she is in Denver is "very pro mask." She thinks Burdge's experience dealing with outbreaks — likely intensified by DeSantis' order to eliminate mask mandates — indicate "why we need to be following the health guidelines and scientific evidence on this," she says. "The health guidelines work."Sposato says her greatest fear heading into this new school year "is that one of the mutations is going to outflank the vaccine, and we will see steeper, higher numbers of COVID being present in our community."Gavin says her biggest fear is over school closures. "Kids need to be in school. We need to be in school," she says. She hopes that putting layers of protection in place will allow the year to commence safely. "We need to kind of stand firm with that so that we can keep our schools open for our kids.Burdge says school closures are on everyone's minds, but that she's also concerned "for our nurses and their safety and well-being — that we are going to get burnt out.""Our school nurses are exhausted," Gavin says. "I think last year I had said school nurses felt like the weight of the pandemic was on their shoulders. We're on our knees now, with the weight of the pandemic on our shoulders."Elena Burnett and Amy Isackson produced and edited this story for broadcast.

Joe NeelA health care worker fills a syringe with the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City this year.Mary Altaffer/APhide captionA health care worker fills a syringe with the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City this year.The leaders of two federal health agencies are urging the White House to rethink its plan to roll out COVID-19 vaccine boosters starting Sept. 20.The leaders of the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are telling White House COVID-19 advisers that there is not enough data right now to make a blanket recommendation on boosters and that it may be prudent to start boosters with older adults first, pending FDA authorization. That's according to a source who has knowledge of the situation but is not authorized to speak publicly.The development was first reported byThe New York Times.In mid-August, President Biden said the administration would begin offering boosters on Sept. 20, pending FDA and CDC authorization. It would apply, he said, to people who had received their second shot of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine at least eight months ago.Dr. Anthony Fauci, the White House medical adviser, has said that based on data from the U.S. and Israel showing that immunity begins to decline after six to eight months, a booster would be needed.At a White House briefing on Thursday to support a recommendation for boosters, Fauci presented additional data from Israel on the use of boosters in adults 60 and older.The study looked at more than a million people who had received a third shot of the Pfizer vaccine starting at the end of July. Those results showed a strong immune response, Fauci said, adding that he believes a three-dose regimen of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines would become "routine."Based on that and other data, FDA acting Commissioner Janet Woodcock and CDC Director Rochelle Walensky reportedly urged White House COVID-19 adviser Jeffrey Zients to make the rollout more limited while more data are collected on other age groups — and to base the timing on careful scientific analysis of the existing data, the bulk of which is focused on older adults.In a statement released earlier this week by the FDA, the agency's vaccine chief, Peter Marks, stressed that the agency would follow its usual procedures, including calling a meeting of an advisory board on Sept. 17 to review data that has been submitted by Pfizer in support of a booster dose of its vaccine."The administration recently announced a plan to prepare for additional COVID-19 vaccine doses, or 'boosters,' this fall, and a key part of that plan is FDA completing an independent evaluation and determination of the safety and effectiveness of these additional vaccine doses," Marks said in the statement."The process for authorizing or approving the use of a booster dose of a COVID-19 vaccine involves each vaccine manufacturer submitting data pertaining to safety and effectiveness to the agency to support this use," he added. "The FDA is evaluating data submitted by Pfizer-BioNTech in a supplemental Biologics License Application for its COVID-19 vaccine and will discuss it with the agency's advisory committee to inform our decision-making."So far, the focus on a booster dose involves the two vaccines based on mRNA technology that are made by Pfizer and Moderna. Pfizer was the first vaccine to receive authorization for emergency use by the FDA and the first to gain full approval for use in people 16 and older.Moderna's authorization followed a week after Pfizer's last winter. Also, Pfizer's application for authorization of a booster dose was submitted to the FDA earlier than Moderna's, so it is expected that any action from the health agencies would likely come first for Pfizer, then Moderna.The Johnson & Johnson vaccine was authorized by the FDA several months later than the Moderna vaccine. Fauci and others have said they expect that people who received that single-dose vaccine would also need an additional dose as a booster.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Sarah VarneyFromAllie Henderson with her sister Claire (left) and her mom, LeAnn, outside their home recently in Terry, Miss. "I want people to get vaccinated — because I know what it feels like," Allie says of her near-fatal encounter with COVID-19 this year.Imani Khayyam for KHNhide captionAllie Henderson with her sister Claire (left) and her mom, LeAnn, outside their home recently in Terry, Miss. "I want people to get vaccinated — because I know what it feels like," Allie says of her near-fatal encounter with COVID-19 this year.The Allie Henderson who stepped out of her mother's car to a driveway full of cheering friends and family holding "Welcome Home" signs in Februarywas a wisp of her former self.After 10 days in the hospital with a near-fatal case of amultisystem inflammatory syndromerelated to COVID-19, the softball phenom and beloved, straight-A student, then 13, was lethargic and frail. She braced herself against the car's door frame.But six months later, despite having watched a loved one struggle with the illness, some of Allie's closest friends and family remain unvaccinated.Meanwhile, with the highly contagious delta variantswarming across Mississippi, the state has one of the highest per capita infectionrates in the nationand one of the lowest vaccination rates. In Hinds County, where the Hendersons live, the vaccination rate against the coronavirus as of early September is 45% — well below the national average of 53%.Stories such as Allie's and her family's are playing out across the United States as neighbors and friends who love each other are staring COVID-19 in the face and still not seeing it the same way. Listening to the people in Allie's world offers a few clues into the whys of those dissonant views.In January, Allie was hospitalized with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. The condition appears to affect children two to eight weeks after an asymptomatic or mild coronavirus infection.LeAnn Hendersonhide captionIn January, Allie was hospitalized with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. The condition appears to affect children two to eight weeks after an asymptomatic or mild coronavirus infection."I feel like it hasn't been tested enough," says Erin Acey, 16, of the vaccine. Acey is a cousin of Allie's who lives a block away and grew up playing whiffle ball with Allie in the backyard.Acey's parents are also not vaccinated, nor is another cousin, Cara McClure, a hairstylist in nearby Clinton. McClure, 23, is suspicious of conflicting information she's heard about the vaccine."I try not to watch the news. I get it from Facebook," McClure says. "I really try not to talk about it at work because it's like politics: You don't talk about politics at work."The gravity of Allie's condition last winter became clear when the prayer requests went out, months before vaccines to prevent COVID-19 were widely available.Congregations across the area — in Crystal Springs, Hazlehurst, Wesson and Georgetown — prayed for Allie. Teachers at Copiah Academy, the teen's small, independent Christian school in Gallman, Miss., prayed before class.Allie's grandmother textedthe Rev. Wayne Hall, pastor at Jackson First, an Assembly of God church where the Hendersons have been regular parishioners. Allie was a fixture in the children's ministry, a vivacious child always in the middle of the action, and the Hendersons are an admired family of go-getters. "Please pray," the text said. "Allie is in the hospital.""When the request went out, it was all hands on deck," says Hall, who hunts with Allie's dad, Brook. He recalls the private prayer he said aloud, "We believe in God to heal her body and are praying for Mom and Dad, who are walking through this, because there are a lot of unknowns."Allie had felt crummy at school on a Monday in late January but still managed to play in a basketball game that evening. A few days later, she was doubled over with stomach pain, and no remedy — not Tylenol, Motrin or baths — would break her 104-degree fever. LeAnn Henderson, Allie's mother, asked her best friend, Caroline Young, a nurse and fellow softball mom, "Why can't we get this fever to go away?"At the emergency room, Allie tested negative for the coronavirus, strep and influenza, and doctors settled on removing her inflamed appendix. But soon after the surgery, her fever spiked again. Her blood pressure and oxygen levels dropped. Her eyes were eerily bloodshot and her hands splotchy."Allie was so weak, she was talking about giving up," LeAnn Henderson remembers.An ambulance whisked Allie to Children's of Mississippi, a hospital in Jackson with a pediatric intensive care unit, where doctors diagnosed her withmultisystem inflammatory syndromein children. MIS-C, as the condition is known, appears to affect children two to eight weeks after an asymptomatic or mild coronavirus infection. A blood test found antibodies to the coronavirus, and Allie began receiving steroids, blood pressure medication and intravenous antibiotics to fight the syndrome.McClure, who often styled Allie's hair and took her to the local water park, video chatted with her cousin. "She looked tired, drained — her face was white," McClure says. Already thin, Allie was losing weight. At the hair salon, McClure tried to keep the unfolding family crisis away from clients who were already spooked by the pandemic. Her co-workers would see her crying between appointments.Allie takes a walk during her hospitalization in January, with the help of physical and occupational therapists. Even after she was able to return to school, recovery was slow. She was overcome by seizures sometimes and passed out at least twice. One night, Allie awoke and couldn't feel her legs.LeAnn Hendersonhide captionAllie takes a walk during her hospitalization in January, with the help of physical and occupational therapists. Even after she was able to return to school, recovery was slow. She was overcome by seizures sometimes and passed out at least twice. One night, Allie awoke and couldn't feel her legs.Outside the hospital windows, friends and family stood on the grass and held up signs that Allie could see from her room. There was an endless stream of food deliveries for the family: Chick-fil-A, chili from Wendy's, seafood pasta from Biaggi's."Everybody in Allie's world knew about this — softball, school, church — it was on our doorstep," LeAnn Henderson says. "People had known adults who had gotten sick and been in the hospital, but not sick like Allie. I think it was like, 'Wow, this is real. And this happened to her.' They know how strong and athletic [she is]. She's a power hitter."At Copiah Academy, Allie's absence registered with growing fear. "Parents began to get scared," says Rita Henley, a school administrator. The school had taken someCOVID-19 precautions— sanitizing classrooms, requiring students to wear masks and to distance themselves physically from each other. Students who tested positive for the coronavirus had to isolate themselves at home, whilethose who shared classrooms or sports teams had to go into quarantine. "Some of the parents embraced it, and some didn't," Henley says. "It reflected the differences in opinion that we have right now in our country."As Allie came in and out of consciousness at the hospital, she fretted about her grades and about missing the remainder of basketball season and the upcoming softball season."Allie is a very aggressive athlete, always ready to practice and play hard," says Young, the friend of Allie's mother whose daughter plays on the same travel softball team as Allie. "That was the most poignant thing about the illness — we saw a really strong teammate become weak."On Feb. 7, Henderson drove her daughter Allie home to the cheers and open arms of a loving gaggle of friends and family. "I started crying, she started crying, everyone started crying," says Acey, Allie's cousin.Henderson shared her family's ordeal with a local television station. "I immediately went to the media and said, 'This is something else COVID can do. This happened to my 13-year-old. We need to look out for this.' "Allie returned to school for a few hours each day and grew stronger. On occasion, she was overcome by seizures, passing out once in the bathroom at home and once on her way to her bedroom. One night, Allie awoke and couldn't feel her legs."I was screaming," says Henderson, whose usual unflappable disposition had finally caved. By spring break, in mid-March, after neurology appointments and brain and heart scans, Allie started coming back to herself. She and her family got the vaccines when they became available.At school, the questions overwhelmed her. To deflect the constant queries about her absence, she joked, "I said I had a bad haircut and couldn't come to school." But she didn't feel the urge to proselytize about the dangers of COVID-19. "I don't like to go public about personal stuff."She suited up for a softball scrimmage and could barely hoist the bat above her shoulder. "It was very difficult because I couldn't do what I could do before," Allie says. She told her mom, "I just suck at this."The crowd of softball dads teared up when Allie would try to swing the bat. "It's amazing that she's out there," Henderson said the men told her later about her daughter.Students returned to Copiah Academy in early August. Masks are not required, nor is the COVID-19 vaccine for those who are eligible. "Our internal conversation is that we do not feel we can require the vaccine unless the state requires it," Henley says. But "because of Allie, people — without question — know that this is a real thing."Still, the shifting nature of the pandemic — the arrival of the delta variant, the news that vaccinated people can spread the coronavirus infection — has brewed confusion. "I truly think that we see too much back-and-forth on the news. I think it hurts people," says Henley, who is fully vaccinated against the virus. "People don't know what to believe."Federal health officials say that millions of Americans have been safely vaccinated and that vaccination reduces the risk of severe complications from COVID-19.Hall, the pastor of the Hendersons' church, is reluctant to direct his parishioners to get vaccinated, though he says, "Allie's story has helped a lot of people really understand, 'Hey, this is not a pick-and-choose kind of deal. It can hit home anywhere.' "His congregation, he says, believes in healing. "We believe in the power of God, and we also know God gives wisdom," he says. "If the CDC is saying things we need to abide by, we need to really listen."At the hair salon in Clinton, McClure shares more openly now about her cousin's illness with her clients. "I'll say, 'My little cousin had it,' and we get to talking about it," McClure says. But even now, she doesn't push it. "When clients come in, we want it to be about them. We ask, 'Are you going on vacation?' We focus on them to make them feel good."McClure does notice that others in her sphere have dropped their guard when it comes to defending themselves against catching the virus or spreading it. "They take everything for granted," she says." 'Oh, we're good. We're fine. We don't have to sanitize.' Even now at the salon we try to make people sanitize, and they're like, 'Ugh.' "McClure had a mild coronavirus infection at Thanksgiving — headache and nausea — but it passed. Even now, she's in no rush to get vaccinated. "Even with the vaccine, you can still get it," she says. "Every day I feel like something about it is changing — there's a new strand," she says.Acey, Allie's 16-year-old cousin, still isn't sure when — or if — she'll get vaccinated. She's nervous about the side effects and wants to "wait and see." In her view, the pandemic has "died down" and she's unfamiliar with the delta variant. Rather than believe what she sees on the news or hears from federal health officials, she says she would "rather read about it and see it myself.""I know she has a different perspective," Allie says of her cousin. "I would have a different perspective if it hadn't happened to me. I just know some people are like, 'My body, my choice.' Everything these days is about politics, and nobody likes to be wrong."It's very confusing, for my part," Allie says. "I want people to get vaccinated — because I know what it feels like."Some of her closest friends have gotten the vaccine. Was it because of what happened to her? She doesn't hesitate: "Yes, ma'am."PBS NewsHourproducer Jason Kane contributed to this report.Kaiser Health Newsis an editorially independent, national newsroom and program of the Kaiser Family Foundation.

Restaurants could only offer takeout food.BEIJING – When Tom, an American businessman, got a dream job building up a multinational company in China, he happily moved his young family there.Then the pandemic hit.Tom and his family traveled back to the United States, but in March last year, Chinasealed off its borders. Later, it evenstopped issuingnew passports to its own citizens to curb travel. He made it back to China by receiving aspecial letterapproved by the mayor of the Chinese city he works in, but his family were not able to get permission to enter. He applied again and waited for them in China."You think, let's just try for one more month, but eventually that breaks [down]," says Tom. "I'm depressed. The family's depressed. We just want to see each other."He finally had to relocate, at least temporarily. As of last month, he and his family has moved to Thailand where, for the first time in more than a year and a half, they can live together.Tom and his family are among hundreds of thousands of people stuck outside China, sometimes separated from loved ones or their livelihoods. Most of the people in this story, like Tom, asked us to use only their first name because they do not want to jeopardize their chances of getting back into China.Within China, anti-virus measures are even more strict for residents than for international travelers entering the country. The appearance of a single delta case can get an entire citylocked down. Traveling from a place with delta cases? That could be three weeks of hotel quarantine in a city such as Beijing.These are some of the ways China has been keeping new daily coronavirus infections to sometimes single digits. But with the highly-contagious delta variant now spreading across the country, some public health experts have begun to question whether China's zero tolerance can contain the pandemic long term – and whether it is worth the cost.China has excelled at identifying and isolating new infections while shutting down large swathes of the country if needed to block new clusters from growing.These complete lockdowns are effective at reducing total infections and giving hospitals time to prepare, but they require heavy sacrifices from those stuck inside.Socioeconomically vulnerable populations are hit the hardest. Two- or three-week hotel quarantines for close contacts or those traveling from a region with active COVID cases must be paid out of pocket, a heavy expense for most citizens. And many of China's migrant workers – who power the country's service and e-commerce industries – have been unable to see their families in other cities because they fear being locked down away from their jobs if they were to return for a visit and then end up in lockdown.Moreover, lockdowns only work if they are absolutely enforced for long periods of time, saysTamer Oraby, a statistician at the University of Texas, Rio Grande Valley, who studies how outbreaks spread: "With short term lockdowns, the disease is probably going to keep spreading between individuals of a household for a while. If we suddenly remove the lockdown, those people are going to go outside again and start spreading the disease once more."Such rigid methods can be problematic to maintain as new clusters emerge across China each week."I'm pretty confident that China can contain this wave of epidemic. But if it takes a long time to contain the epidemic or [outbreaks] happen repeatedly, I think it will be more evidence that China needs to consider other methods," saysDr. Jennifer Bouey, an epidemiologist at the RAND Corporation.She questions "whether the completion of testing and quarantines is feasible when the delta transmission is so fast," because there is no guarantee China can contact trace and quarantine people in time before they infect others.The lockdowns continue despite a high rate of vaccination. China has given out 2 billion doses, mostly of domestically-produced vaccines, enough to cover nearly 80% of the population. But it remains hesitant to relax its strict policies because there is no public data on how effective Chinese vaccines remain over time or how good they are against variants.And so China has indicated it will likely stick with their zero infection approach, even though experts predict that seasonal outbreaks of the novel coronavirus are almost certainlyhere to stay."Is it feasible to 'coexist with the virus'? The author believes that it is definitely not feasible,"wroteGao Qiang, a former Chinese health minister, in early August. "The 'coexistence with the virus' as adopted by Britain, the United States and other countries has already brought serious consequences to global efforts to contain the epidemic. We must not repeat the same mistakes."By keeping new infections low, China has been able to restart its economy and resume most domestic travel.But the prioritization of total virus containment has come at the expense of cultural, commercial and intellectual ties to the world."The steady flow of people back and forth has completely eroded," saysRory Truex, an assistant professor of international relations at Princeton University. "The simplest thing that's missing is the trust building exercise that comes with human-to-human exchange."Chinese public health officials say they intend to keep China isolatedfor at least the next year. Truex argues that international border closures could worsen China's diplomatic relations with the U.S."Now you have people both in the U.S. and China that are sort of able to speculate or pontificate about what's going on the other side without much first-hand knowledge," says Truex. "That leads us down a path where both parties are assuming the worst about the other."There's also been a disruption in programs that bring in international students. Before the pandemic, China was trying to become a global research hub to rival the U.S. It gave government scholarships to promising Ph.D. researchers to study and work in China."We are vaccinated. We are ready for quarantine and for all the testing, whatever they want. But please, do not destroy our future," says Waqas, a Pakistani student pursuing his Ph.D. in China.But now he cannot get back to China from Pakistan, nor can he finish his doctoral research: "Unfortunately, my lab mates have packed my experiment table and the thing on which I spent ten months is now in the dustbin." He asked that his last name not be used lest he jeopardize his chances of returning to his studies.Luckier international students can finish their degrees virtually but say an online education is far less robust. "I ask China, would you trust a doctor who learnt about appendix surgery by reading a 42-slide PowerPoint at home while eating Oreos?" says Puneet Sharma, a medical student in India who hopes to resume her studies in person at a Chinese university.Police officers (left and second from right) wear protective gear as they explain how to fight the spread of Covid-19 to workers at Nanjing port in China's eastern Jiangsu province on August 4.Stringer/AFP via Getty Imageshide captionPolice officers (left and second from right) wear protective gear as they explain how to fight the spread of Covid-19 to workers at Nanjing port in China's eastern Jiangsu province on August 4.China's global commercial ties are also taking a hit. International shipping has been seriouslysnarled upby quarantines atmajor Chinese ports. Entire factorieshave to go offlineif a region is shut down. Three-week quarantines and travel restrictions have diminished China's ability to attract foreign workers."In many cases they were unable to or didn't want to travel to China because of travel restrictions," says Max Lee, a manager at JobRight Human Resources, a recruiting firm that works with Chinese firms."Our number one issue right now is mobility and its impact on business continuity. It's getting the executives in and out of China and with their families," saysKer Gibbs, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai.Slowing domestic consumption, coupled with the delta variant, causedNick Marro, a macro economist with the Economist's Intelligence Unit, to shave 0.4% off his China economic growth forecast: "The COVID restrictions kind of pushed us to make that call just because we are seeing quite a strict, quite a severe approach to ensuring that the outbreak remains controllable."Yet Beijing has committed to host the Winter Olympics in less than half a year. Thousands of athletes and reporters from all over the world are expected to attend. Beijing Olympics organizers have already said they will ask staff to quarantine in government facilities before and after entering game venues and has barred international spectators.Beijing is also planning three "bubbles" with limited access around major athletic facilities in and around the city, according to two diplomats working on Olympics access issues. They requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Visiting reporters will need to leave right after the games and will not be allowed to travel to other parts of China, as was possible during Beijing's previous 2008 summer Olympics.These measures – and a lackluster Tokyo Olympics — have bolstered fears that China's coronavirus prevention measures could stymie independent coverage of China during the games, turning an athletic spectacle meant to highlight global engagement into a highly-managed stage-show."Will [journalists] have any freedom of movement? Will they be able to move beyond just where the games are being held so they can understand some of the broader fabric of the nation that is hosting the games?" asksBill Holstein, a board member of the Overseas Press Club, a professional association.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

Students in Illinois schools will be able to take up to five excused mental or behavioral health days beginning in January 2022.Nam Y. Huh/APhide captionStudents wear mask as they arrive at school for in-person learning at Holmes Middle School in Wheeling, Ill., on Oct. 21, 2020. Students in Illinois schools will be able to take up to five excused mental or behavioral health days beginning in January 2022.Students across Illinois will be able to take up to five excused mental health days starting in January.Under abillsigned into law by Gov. J.B. Pritzker last month, students who decide to take a mental health day will not be required to provide their school with a doctor's note and will be able to make up any work that was missed on their day off."Having this now for all students across the state will be really beneficial, especially with what's going on with COVID," State Rep. Barbara Hernandez, who co-sponsored the bill, told theJournal-Courier. "Many students feel stressed, and have developed anxiety and depression because they're not able to see teachers and friends, and may have lower grades due to remote learning."The pandemic has placed unique strains on children, and as a new school year begins, child psychiatrists say they expect to see a surge of kids who need help.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, between March and May of last year, hospitals across the country saw a 24% increase in the number of mental health emergency visits by kids aged 5 to 11 years old, and a 31% increase for kids 12 to 17."The younger school-age kids are more anxious about separation from their parents and caregivers," child and adolescent psychiatrist Dr. Ujjwal Ramtekkar at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Ohio,told NPR. "They're worried about getting sick," or their parents getting sick.For teens, the challenges can be somewhat different, according to Ramtekkar. Most teenagers are struggling with social and academic anxiety, he said, as most are worried about socializing with their peers again and adapting to full-time in-person learning.With the new law in Illinois, Hernandez says students will have more of an opportunity to get the care they need."I am really excited for this. I think it will help students, parents and teachers, and can help them understand what's going on in their students' lives," Hernandez said.Once a student requests a second mental health day, a school counselor will reach out to their family and the student may be referred to get professional help, according to thebill.Hernandez says that after students take their second mental health day, they should understand that a conversation with an adult is needed about whatever it is they're going through."Many students are going through a lot mentally and emotionally and they need support," Hernandez said.School districts across Illinois will have until the end of the year to come up with a specific plan to execute the new law ahead of its effective date in January.Illinois joins states such as Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Maine, Nevada, Oregon and Virginia that have passed similar bills over the last two years allowing students to be absent from school due to mental or behavioral health reasons, according toThe New York Times.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Bill ChappellInmates do a deep cleaning in a cell pod to prevent the spread of COVID-19 at the San Diego County Jail in April 2020. A new study says crowded jails may have contributed to millions of COVID-19 cases across the United States.Sandy Huffaker/Getty Imageshide captionInmates do a deep cleaning in a cell pod to prevent the spread of COVID-19 at the San Diego County Jail in April 2020. A new study says crowded jails may have contributed to millions of COVID-19 cases across the United States.If the U.S. had done more to reduce its incarceration rate, it could have prevented millions of COVID-19 cases.That's the conclusion of researchers who conducted what they say is the first study to link mass incarceration rates to pandemic vulnerability. Many of those preventable cases, they add, occurred in communities of color.TheU.S. jail and prison systemacts as an epidemic engine, according to the study from researchers at Northwestern University and the World Bank.That engine is driven by a massive number of people who, despite some counties' efforts to trim jail populations, have been cycling between cramped detention facilities and their home communities.After analyzing data from 1,605 counties, the researchers linked an 80% reduction in the U.S. jail population to a 2% drop in the growth rate of daily COVID-19 cases.Such a substantial drop in the incarceration level could have been achieved by instituting alternatives to jail for nonviolent offenses, according to the researchers — Dr. Eric Reinhart of the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine and Daniel Chen of the Toulouse School of Economics and the World Bank.That 2% reduction is a conservative estimate, but it still represents a dramatic potential shift, Reinhart told NPR.When compounded daily, Reinhart said in a Northwestern news release about the study, "even just a 2% reduction in daily case growth rates in the U.S. from the beginning of the pandemic until now would translate to the prevention of millions of cases."Tens of thousands of deaths could also have been prevented, he said.A red tag on a cell door signifies an active COVID-19 case for its inhabitants. The first medically vulnerable inmates in Minnesota were vaccinated at Faribault Prison in January.Aaron Lavinsky/Star Tribune/Getty Imageshide captionA red tag on a cell door signifies an active COVID-19 case for its inhabitants. The first medically vulnerable inmates in Minnesota were vaccinated at Faribault Prison in January.The U.S. has long had the world's highest incarceration rate among industrialized countries reporting such statistics. During the pandemic, it has also reported more COVID-19 cases and deaths than any other country despite having less than 5% of the global population.The new research, published Thursday in the journalJAMA Network Open, suggests those circumstances are directly related.On average, U.S jails currently host some 650,000 detainees every day, according to Reinhart. The dynamic also includes more than 220,000 full-time jail staff, who commute back and forth from their homes each day, the study said.Many of those detainees are held in custody for only short periods of time as they either await trial or serve short sentences. The U.S. jail population has a 55% weekly turnover rate, according to the study."This jail churn effectively produces epidemic machines that seed outbreaks both in and beyond jails, undermining public safety for the entire country," Reinhart said.Citing crowded conditions and poor health care in jails and prisons, a summary of the study from Northwestern said the U.S. facilities "have effectively become infectious disease incubators," putting the country at a higher epidemiological risk.The link between prisons and public health is one of the reasons Black and Hispanic communities have been disproportionately harmed by the coronavirus, the study's authors said.The spread of the coronavirus between jails and communities "likely accounts for a substantial proportion of the racial disparities we have seen in COVID-19 cases across the U.S.," Reinhart said."Ultimately, this also harms all U.S. residents regardless of race, class or partisan affiliations, as disregarding the health of marginalized people inevitably causes harm — albeit unevenly — to everyone else in a society, too," he added.The benefits of cutting the jail population would be magnified, Reinhart and Chen wrote, in counties with high proportions of Black residents as well as in urban areas with above-average population density.The study's findings are based on data from jails that reduced their populations at rates from 20% to 50% during the pandemic in response to health risks from COVID-19.The researchers sought to predict what the results would look like if the U.S. dropped its jail population by 80%, which would bring the country closer to the average rates seen in peer nations.The study relied on data gathered at the county level from January 2020 to November, representing 72% of the U.S. population.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

This year, the CDC is recommending that people who are not fully vaccinated stay home.Jae C. Hong/APhide captionPeople crowd the beach in Huntington Beach, Calif., over the long Labor Day weekend last year, months before COVID-19 vaccines were available. This year, the CDC is recommending that people who are not fully vaccinated stay home.If you're not vaccinated, you shouldn't travel over the long Labor Day weekend.That's the bottom line, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky."First and foremost, if you are unvaccinated, we would recommend not traveling," Walensky said at aWhite House COVID-19 briefing on Tuesday.Since the start of the pandemic, holiday weekends, when many Americans traditionally travel, have been a special concern for health officials because they increase the chances that the virus can spread widely and quickly.Last year, before vaccines were available to the public, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA)screened more than 3 million airline passengersover the Labor Day holiday.However, despite the wide availability of vaccines this year, the coronavirus delta variant and an unwillingness on the part of many Americans to get vaccinated has caused a major spike in infections and hospitalizations.Speaking at Tuesday's briefing, White House COVID-19 Response Coordinator Jeff Zients said that ahead of Labor Day weekend, "it's critical that being vaccinated is part of their pre-holiday checklist."If you are not fully vaccinated and decide to travel within the U.S. anyway, the CDC recommends that you take the following precautions:"People who are fully vaccinated, and who are wearing masks, can travel," Walensky said. "Although, given where we are with disease transmission right now, we would say that people need to take these risks into their own consideration as they think about traveling."Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
The Associated PressLITTLE ROCK, Ark. — Several inmates at a northwest Arkansas jail said they weren't told a medication they were given to treat COVID-19 was actually an anti-parasite drug that federal health officials have warned should not be used to treat the coronavirus.Three inmates at the Washington County jail told The Associated Press they didn't know they were being given ivermectinuntil its use at the facility was revealed last week. The American Civil Liberties Union of Arkansas, which on Wednesday repeated its call for the practice to end, said it's also heard similar complaints from inmates.The inmates' comments contradict assertions by the sheriff and the jail's physician that the use of the drug was voluntary.The drug's use at the jail has prompted an investigation by the state Medical Board."They were pretty much testing us in here is all they were doing, seeing if it would work," said William Evans, an inmate who said he was given the drug for two weeks after he tested positive for COVID-19.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved ivermectin for use by people and animals for some parasitic worms and for head lice and skin conditions. The FDA has not approved its use in treating or preventing COVID-19 in humans.The drug's manufacturer,Merck, said in Februarythat it had found no evidence that ivermectin is an effective treatment for patients with COVID-19.The American Medical Association, the American Pharmacists Association and the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists on Wednesdaycalled for an immediate endto prescribing and using the drug to treat the coronavirus outside clinical trials.Washington County Sheriff Tim Helder, a spokesperson for his office and jail physician Dr. Rob Karas did not respond to calls or emails on Wednesday. Karas last week released a lengthy statement defending the use of ivermectin, saying he had been prescribing the drug to inmates and patients at his clinics since late last year.Edrick Floreal-Wooten, an inmate, said he was given ivermectin at the jail after he tested positive on Aug. 21."I asked what are they, and they'd just tell me vitamins," Floreal-Wooten said. "With me being sick and all of us being sick, we thought that they were there to help us. I never thought they would do something shady."Floreal-Wooten said he refused to take the drug last week after seeing a news article about ivermectin being prescribed to inmates.Asked whether he would have taken the drug had they told him at the outset it was ivermectin, he responded: "Never. I'm not livestock. I'm a human."The ACLU said it has also heard from several inmates who say they were told the drug was vitamins or steroids.In a letter to Helder on Wednesday, the ACLU said some inmates are prepared to file a lawsuit to halt the drug from being prescribed. The group said it was "unconscionable" that inmates weren't informed they were being given the drug."They have a right to know what they are being given," ACLU of Arkansas Executive Director Holly Dickson said. "This is not a right they forego by virtue of being locked up."Before the jail's ivermectin use was revealed, the state Medical Board told Karas last month that it received two complaints against him over a post on his clinics' Facebook page where he said he didn't believe face masks decreased the spread of viruses, according to documents released under a Freedom of Information Act request.Karas told the board in written responses last week that his opinions were based on his 20-plus years of experience and "review of the literature through the years."Pharmacy prescriptions for ivermectin have jumped nationwide this summer, and health officials in Arkansas and other states have issued warnings after seeing a spike in poison control center calls about people taking the animal form of the drug to treat COVID-19.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last week sent an alert about the trend to doctors. The CDC said there is not good evidence that ivermectin is effective at preventing or treating COVID-19, and that the government has not authorized it to be used against the coronavirus.Despite the warnings, Republican lawmakers in Arkansas and other states have touted the drug as a potential treatment for COVID-19.Dr. Jose Romero, Arkansas' secretary of health, wouldn't say whether he thought it was appropriate for the inmates to be prescribed ivermectin but said using any drug off-label would require an agreement between the physician and the patient."I don't know what agreement has been made," Romero told reporters at a news conference this week. Romero said the Arkansas Health Department doesn't endorse its use for COVID-19.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Austin FastMedics transport a man with COVID-19 symptoms to a hospital in Austin, Texas. More than 3 million people in the state have had COVID-19, but just 81,000 are listed in a central data set at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.John Moore/Getty Imageshide captionMedics transport a man with COVID-19 symptoms to a hospital in Austin, Texas. More than 3 million people in the state have had COVID-19, but just 81,000 are listed in a central data set at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Colorful maps on the newonline Health Equity Trackerreveal how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected different races and age groups across the United States, but you can tell something is not quite right.A handful of states are grayed out, and that's not because they've escaped the pandemic."There's no data coming out of Texas," points out software engineer Josh Zarrabi of Atlanta's Morehouse School of Medicine, which recently rolled out the tracking portal. "A lot of Americans should be unhappy about that. And they should say, like, 'Wow, like, we need the data, right, because we're missing a huge piece of the puzzle here.' "And it's not just a search for jigsaw pieces from Texas.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention hastallied over 39 million cases of COVID-19in the U.S., but if you want to know more detailed information, such as where patients live, whether patients were hospitalized or died, demographic details like race, gender and age, that information isgathered separately.In that more detailed CDC data set, about 1 in 5 known cases — or 7 million people — are completely missing, an NPR analysis found. On top of that, about two-thirds of the data present aren't usable, as health care providers marked fields as "Unknown" or simply left them blank.Most states have voluntarily sent up whatever records they have, but a handful have not. Texas, Missouri, Louisiana, West Virginia and Wyoming have each submitted less than one-tenth of their total cases. Another handful of states, including Florida, Michigan and Kentucky, have smaller but still significant gaps in their data, each completely missing over 30% of their known cases.Over 3 million Texans have had COVID-19, but just 81,000 are in the data set. That's not even 3%.Loading..."That is ludicrous. It is shameful. It is wrong," says Nancy Krieger, a social epidemiologist at Harvard University. "You need good data to do proper planning, to understand what the risk is, how the risk is changing. And you need that to be real data that are publicly available and accessible."The standardized details that states feed into this data set help the CDC track COVID-19's spread, evaluate demographic trends and develop health guidance for at-risk groups and the country as a whole. However, the completeness of these records varies widely.Just 1% of the records present are missing the patient's age or sex, while 36% of them have race and/or ethnicity marked as "Unknown" or left blank. The CDC asked states to indicate whether patients experienced any of 15 symptoms, including fever, chills or muscle aches, but states largely have not done so. Health departments may update these details as they conclude case investigations, but for more than 90% of patients, most of these fields are currently blank or marked "Unknown."At the CDC, Paula Yoon directs the surveillance of about 120 infectious diseases, including COVID-19. Her epidemiologists use field studies and lab reports to fill in the blanks the best they can. However, Yoon agrees their job would be simpler if they just had all that data."Yes, we would be in a much better place," Yoon says. "It's not because the states are not sharing those data with us. It's because the states don't have those data themselves."There are plenty of reasons why some states haven't submitted their data. Chief among them is the fact that public healthhas been underfundedfor years. This has created a county-by-county patchwork of outdated disease-tracking systems linking hospitals and labs to public health departments.Many counties have their own local tracking systems that can't automatically transfer records to the state and then up to the CDC.At the Jackson County Health Department near Kansas City, Mo., communicable disease division manager Chip Cohlmia jokes that public health is keeping fax machines alive. In his county and many others, hospitals fax records to county health departments, and workers manually enter data."It's like having an old car, and you're needing to push the car to, like, 100 miles an hour," Cohlmia says. "But, you know, you haven't changed the oil. You haven't checked the tires. The check-engine light's been on."Across the state in Columbia, Public Health Planning Supervisor Rebecca Roesslet says they still need to manually transfer 12,000 records — over half of the county's COVID-19 cases so far. It's a painstaking process of copy-and-pasting data points, field by field."That's not our priority. Right now, our priority is in contacting people who have tested positive for COVID and providing them with the education they need and identifying their close contacts," Roesslet says.In Texas, the state health department launched a new COVID-19 tracking system in May 2020, but most large counties had already developed their own systems by then. This only added more patches onto public health's quilt of tracking systems that don't automatically communicate with each other.Austin Public Health's chief epidemiologist, Janet Pichette, says they wanted to collect more data than the state was gathering. They also didn't want to rely on an outside system that might go down unexpectedly."Once you are a person who works in data and epidemiology, you become very territorial. You want to have control of your own data, right?" Pichette says.Just like the CDC can't mandate what state health departments must do, states can't always tell counties or cities what to do."I wouldn't touch that with a 10-foot pole," says Diana Cervantes. She currently teaches epidemiology at the University of North Texas, but she supervised a 49-county region with the state health department until 2018."We basically prefer this hands-off approach. We don't want to start getting in power struggles with the locals," Cervantes says. "The very last thing they're going to worry about is the state because they're not accountable to them."Local health officials report to their county leaders — people like Ellis County Judge Todd Little near Dallas. He had a full-time staffer working to reconcile county data with what he called "unreliable" state data, but they gave up in June."We've done a successful job in mitigating a suburban county's spread. And at this point, we're ready to move on with our lives and experience the freedom that all Texans get to experience on a daily basis. We're ready to move on," Little says.Even in an imaginary world with all the right technology and plenty of workers, filling in missing data isn't always easy. Patients might not fit neatly into the CDC's standard race or sex boxes, or they might not want to reveal personal details."It can be loud, angry, violent screaming and those kinds of things," Cohlmia says, describing his case investigation calls with COVID-19 patients in the Kansas City area. "There have been death threats on our office. There have been protests outside."Several states told NPR the pandemic outstripped their technical capabilities and overwhelmed their limited staff, but some promise that fixes are on the horizon.Spokesperson Lisa Cox from the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services says the department is looking for a way to remove duplicate records before it sends data to the CDC. She expects that by late September.A Texas health department spokesperson says the department expects to transfer case data from various counties into the CDC's system by October. She blames Texas' decentralized public health system for the delay.No state has perfect COVID-19 data. But most, including two dozen other states with decentralized public health systems, have figured out how to send what they do have to the CDC. This allows researchers, nonprofit organizations or any interested citizen to check the data and make fair comparisons across state lines of who's most affected by COVID-19."We should have these data at this point," says Krieger, the Harvard epidemiologist. "The answer to having not-good-enough data is to make it really public that it's not good enough and to figure out, how do you make it better?"Last fall, California'spublic health director resignedbecause a data glitch with the state's tracking system meant thousands of records were missing. Californiapaid a tech firm $15 millionfor a new system that could keep up. Within a few months, California's COVID-19 cases were flowing back into the CDC data set.This summer, theCDC awarded $200 millionin COVID-19 relief funds to states to modernize data systems. Yoon, the CDC's surveillance director, says that this money has helped thousands of hospitals add electronic reporting, but there's a long way to go. It'll take sustained funding, a skilled workforce and cooperation from states and counties to keep going."We can't go it alone," Yoon says. "It's not a one-and-done situation where you modernize it and then you're done and you can walk away."But Texas alone now has over 3 million cases to submit, and Missouri, Louisiana, Mississippi and a handful of other states each have hundreds of thousands to work through.As the delta variant continues its surge, their to-do lists will just keep growing.The CDC'sCOVID-19 case surveillance datais updated twice monthly and includes all cases reported, with a 14-day lag. To calculate the approximate number of COVID-19 patients missing from each state in each update since June 2020, NPR compared the number of records present in each update with thatstate's cumulative case countfrom 14 days earlier, to account for the reporting lag.The data set contains 29 variables from standardizedCOVID-19 case report forms. To calculate the number of unusable fields, NPR found how many records were marked "Missing" or "Unknown" for each variable.The data used in this report comes from the most recent update, on Aug. 17.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
The Associated PressThis undated image provided by the United States District Court for the Northern District of California shows two fake CDC COVID-19 vaccination record cards that are part of a criminal complaint.US Courts/APhide captionThis undated image provided by the United States District Court for the Northern District of California shows two fake CDC COVID-19 vaccination record cards that are part of a criminal complaint.NEW YORK — A New Jersey woman calling herself the AntiVaxMomma on Instagram sold several hundred fake COVID-19 vaccination cards at $200 a pop to New York City-area jab dodgers, including people working in hospitals and nursing homes, prosecutors said Tuesday.For an extra $250, a second scammer would then enter a bogus card buyer's name into a New York state vaccination database, which feeds systems used to verify vaccine status at places they're required, such as concerts and sporting events, prosecutors said.Jasmine Clifford, of Lyndhurst, New Jersey, was charged Tuesday with offering a false instrument, criminal possession of a forged instrument and conspiracy. Authorities say she sold about 250 fake vaccine cards in recent months.Clifford's alleged co-conspirator, Nadayza Barkley, of Bellport, Long Island, did not enter a plea an an arraignment Tuesday morning in Manhattan criminal court on charges of offering a false instrument and conspiracy.Prosecutors say Barkley entered at least 10 names into the state's vaccine database while working at a Patchogue medical clinic and received payments for her work from Clifford through the services Zelle and CashApp.Online court records did not list lawyers for Clifford or Barkley who could comment.Thirteen alleged card purchasers were also charged, including a man who has been accused of paying to be entered in the database. Actual COVID-19 vaccines are available free of charge.Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. called on Facebook, which owns Instagram, and other tech companies to crack down on vaccine card fraudsters, saying in a statement "the stakes are too high to tackle fake vaccination cards with whack-a-mole prosecutions."Facebook said that it prohibits anyone from buying or selling COVID-19 vaccine cards and that it removed Clifford's account in early August for breaking its rules."We will review any other accounts that might be doing the same thing," the company said in a written statement. "We appreciate the DA's work on this matter and will remove this content whenever we find it."According to prosecutors, Clifford, a self-described online entrepreneur, started hawking forged Centers for Disease Control and Prevention vaccination cards through her AntiVaxMomma Instagram account in May.A New York state police investigator who became aware of the scam a few weeks later tested it by contacting Clifford to order a fake card and to be added to the state vaccine database, prosecutors said.In July, the investigator said in court papers, he received a package containing a CDC COVID-19 vaccination card marked with the name and date of birth he provided and a cellphone screenshot showing that the information he provided had also been added to the state database.The proliferation of fake vaccine cards is a growing concern as more places require proof of vaccination to work, eat in restaurants, and participate in day-to-day activities like going to the gym or seeing a movie. In New York City, such a mandate is already in effect, with enforcement set to begin Sept. 13.All public school teachers and other staffers in the city are required to get their first vaccinate dose by Sept. 27, while the state has said it is requiring vaccines for health care workers. Other city employees must get vaccinated or tested weekly for the virus.Colleges and universities requiring proof of COVID-19 vaccination for students to attend in-person classes have raised concerns about the easy availability of fraudulent vaccine cards through online sellers.In May, the owner of a Northern California bar was arrested after authorities say he sold made-to-order fake COVID-19 vaccination cards for $20 each.In June, a naturopathic physician in Northern California was arrested on charges she sold fake COVID-19 treatments and vaccination cards.This month, after two tourists were arrested for allegedly using fake vaccine cards to travel into Hawaii, U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., called on federal law enforcement agencies to target online sales of fake COVID-19 vaccination cards and start a campaign making clear that forging them could land people in federal prison.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
The Associated PressWACO, Texas — A Central Texas school district closed its schools until after the Labor Day holiday Tuesday after two teachers died last week of COVID-19.Connally Independent School District officials closed its five suburban Waco schools for the rest of the week after the Saturday COVID-19 death of Natalia Chansler, 41, a sixth grade social studies teacher at Connally Junior High School, said Assistant Superintendent Jill Bottelberghe.Chansler's death came days after David McCormick, 59, a seventh grade social studies teacher at Connally Junior High, died of COVID-19, Bottelberghe said.It was not immediately known if either teacher was vaccinated.Connally High School football coach Terry Gerik says the Cadets will play La Vega as scheduled Friday night.The school has had 51 confirmed COVID-19 cases since classes began Aug. 18, Bottelberghe said Monday. She added that more cases had been confirmed in the last few days, but she did not know if any have been directly traced back to Chansler."We have not found any correlation" between the two deaths, Bottelberghe said. "They were at two different grade levels even though they worked under the same content area, but we have recognized that there has been an increase in spread as far as throughout our student body at those two grade levels."In a Monday email, Superintendent Wesley Holt said the hope "is that the closure and holiday break will provide those who are positive with the virus or exposed to others with the virus, the time to isolate and recover. This closure will also allow time for deep cleaning and sanitizing of all CISD facilities."The rolling seven-day average of new daily COVID-19 cases in Texas was 15,400 cases as of Sunday, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The rolling seven-day average of daily COVID-19 deaths in Texas was 200 per day.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Sharon Pruitt-YoungHealth officials in Illinois have linked nearly 200 COVID-19 cases to two events — a church camp for teens and a men's conference — and the number of people who may have been exposed may be much greater and from multiple states.An organization held a five-day church camp for teens and a two-day men's conference in June that have since been linked to a spike in cases following research by the Illinois Department of Public Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said ina reportMonday. The CDC did not name the organization.As of mid-August, 180 COVID-19 cases had been linked to those who attended one of those events or to someone who had close contact with an attendee, the CDC said.A majority of those cases, 122, were attributed to attendees, with 87 people contracting COVID-19 during the camp and 35 during the conference. Most of those cases, 104, were unvaccinated people.Only five people were hospitalized, none of whom had been vaccinated, and no deaths were reported. But officials say that more than 1,000 people across at least four states could have been exposed through the two events, the CDC said.The report points to these cases as an example of the dangers of hosting large events with little to no safeguards in place. Attendees at both events were not required to be vaccinated, and organizers did not require participants to get tested before allowing entry, the report says.Nearly 300 teens between the ages of 14 and 18 attended the camp after traveling together in large groups on buses. They spent the week living and dining together and mingling with other campers, according to the CDC.It's unclear whether masks were required, but the report says that a list of items to pack for the week did not include masks. Similarly, another 500 people attended the men's conference, where masks were also not required, the CDC says.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

She and other activists are pushing for the British government to investigate its handling of the pandemic.LONDON — Government-sanctioned memorials to the victims of COVID-19 may be years away, but in Europe, some people are making their own. One of the most striking memorials so far is in London, where volunteers have painted more than 150,000 red hearts on a wall along the south bank of the River Thames.People stop to write the names of lost loved ones inside the hearts along with messages as a way to remember and make sense of huge loss of life in the United Kingdom."We were hearing the numbers were going up 40,000, 50,000, 60,000, and it lost meaning," says Fran Hall, who was touching up hearts with a paint-brush one day last month. Hall, who volunteers withthe groupbehind the unofficial memorial — Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK — lost her husband, Steve Mead, to COVID-19 three weeks after they were married.The group, which began painting the hearts in March, chose a wall across from the British Parliament and is pressuring the government to start an inquiry into its mishandling of the pandemic."It's a political location," says Hall. "The decision-makers can't miss this."Many criticized British Prime Minister Boris Johnson for moving too slowly to address the pandemic when it emerged in the early months of 2020. Since then, the country's National Health Service has received high scores for fully vaccinating three-quarters of the country's adults.Johnson announced earlier this year that an inquiry into the government's handling of the pandemic will begin in spring 2022. The prime minister said he did not want to begin an inquiry until the government was certain the worst of the pandemic has passed.NPR London producer Jessica Beck contributed to this report.This story originally published in theMorning Editionlive blog.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

The financial impact of the coronavirus pandemic on Social Security and Medicare is front and center as the government releases its annual report on the state of the bedrock retirement programs on Tuesday, Aug. 31, 2021.Bradley C Bower/APhide captionIn this Feb. 11, 2005 file photo, trays of printed social security checks wait to be mailed from the U.S. Treasury's Financial Management services facility in Philadelphia. The financial impact of the coronavirus pandemic on Social Security and Medicare is front and center as the government releases its annual report on the state of the bedrock retirement programs on Tuesday, Aug. 31, 2021.WASHINGTON — The sharp shock of the coronavirus recession pushed Social Security a year closer to insolvency but left Medicare's exhaustion date unchanged, the government reported Tuesday in a counterintuitive assessment that deepens the uncertainty around the nation's bedrock retirement programs.The new projections in the annual Social Security and Medicare trustees reports indicate that Social Security's massive trust fund will be unable to pay full benefits in 2034 instead of last year's estimated exhaustion date of 2035. For the first time in 39 years the cost of delivering benefits will exceed the program's total income from payroll tax collections and interest during this year. From here on, Social Security will be tapping its savings to pay full benefits.The depletion date for Medicare's trust fund for inpatient care remained unchanged from last year, estimated in 2026.In the 1980s, financial warnings about Social Security prompted then-President Ronald Reagan and lawmakers of both parties in Congress to collaborate on a long-term solvency plan, but such action is unlikely in today's bitter political climate. Democrats who control the White House and Congress offered assurances they would protect both programs."The Biden-Harris administration is committed to safeguarding these programs and ensuring they continue to deliver economic security and health care to older Americans," Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a statement.The latest estimates reflected the push and pull of many factors flowing from the pandemic, and the full impact may take years to sort out. The deep but relatively short recession slashed revenue from payroll taxes. But the death toll from COVID-19, concentrated among older people, reduced future Social Security benefit payouts. Hospitals were stressed by the influx of COVID patients, but Medicare didn't have to pay for as many knee surgeries, colonoscopies and other more routine procedures. Birth rates and immigration, which tend to bolster the two programs, both fell.For Social Security, the loss of payroll tax revenue outweighed any savings from what the program would have paid out to people whose lives were lost in the pandemic. The report noted that employment, earnings, interest rates and economic growth plummeted in the second quarter of 2020 after the pandemic hit the United States."The finances of both programs have been significantly affected by the pandemic and the recession of 2020," the trustees said. But "given the unprecedented level of uncertainty" there was no consensus on what the long-lasting effects of the pandemic would be. A looming question for Medicare: Will the population of beneficiaries who survived the pandemic be healthier on the whole, or will a high number suffer from new conditions like long COVID?Social Security pays benefits to more than 65 million Americans, mainly retirees but also disabled people and survivors of deceased workers. Medicare covers more than 60 million older and disabled people. Together, both programs account for more than 40% of the federal budget, and act as stabilizer not only for families, but for the national economy.While long-term projections are sobering, in the short run there was some good news for Social Security recipients.Government economic experts who prepared the Social Security report estimated recent increases in inflation mean the cost-of-living adjustment for 2022 will approach 6%, a whopping jump from the 1.3% COLA awarded for this year.Some of that may go for higher Medicare costs. The Medicare "Part B" premium for outpatient coverage was projected to rise by $10 a month in 2022, to $158.50 under the report's intermediate assumptions. The official number won't be released until later this year.Social Security and Medicare remain under intense financial pressure with the retirement of millions of baby boomers, who are living longer than previous generations.When the Social Security trust fund is depleted the government will be able to pay 78% of scheduled benefits, the report said. When Medicare's trust fund for inpatient care runs short, it will be able to pay only 91% of expected costs, mainly hospital bills.Because reductions of that magnitude would cause a political uproar, it is likely that a future Congress would find ways to recover the lost benefits, either by hiking the payroll taxes paid by current workers or by increasing government borrowing to cover the shortfall. With Medicare, lawmakers could also raise premiums paid by beneficiaries.It's unclear how the Medicare projections will affect the debate on Capitol Hill about authorizing the program to negotiate prescription drug prices and then using projected savings to provide new Medicare coverage for dental, vision and hearing services. Republicans have argued that any savings should go to shore up the underlying program, not expand benefits.The Medicare report steered clear of making any projections about the new Alzheimer's drug, Aduhelm, which has a list price of $55,000. Most of the 6 million Americans dealing with Alzheimer's are covered by the program, though not all would be candidates for the medication.The trustees' reports, which have been delayed for months, represent the government's effort to assess the impact of last year's pandemic and recession on Social Security and Medicare.The U.S. economy lost a staggering 22.4 million jobs in March and April 2020 as the pandemic forced businesses to close or cut their hours and the economy went into recession.But the recession turned out to be brief and hiring has bounced back as economic growth has resumed. Employers have brought back 16.7 million jobs since April 2020 but that gain still leaves the labor force 5.7 million jobs below where it was before the pandemic hit.The trustees of Social Security and Medicare include the secretaries of Treasury, Health and Human Services, and Labor, as well as the Social Security commissioner. They are supposed to be joined by two "public trustees," knowledgeable private citizens who act as the eyes and ears of taxpayers and beneficiaries. But those posts have been vacant since July 2015 — before the end of the Obama administration. And this year there's no Social Security commissioner either, since President Joe Biden fired Andrew Saul, a holdover appointee from the Trump administration.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Vanessa RomoFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis speaks at the opening of a monoclonal antibody site last month in Pembroke Pines, Fla. DeSantis has sought to block schools from requiring masks for students.Marta Lavandier/APhide captionFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis speaks at the opening of a monoclonal antibody site last month in Pembroke Pines, Fla. DeSantis has sought to block schools from requiring masks for students.Despite a judge's ruling last week declaring that the Florida governor's ban on mask mandates in schools is unconstitutional, the State Board of Education has forged ahead with its threat to withhold school board members' salaries in districts that require the face coverings in classrooms.Education Commissioner Richard Corcoran announced that school board members in Alachua and Broward counties will not be getting paychecks from the Department of Education this month, saying their mandatory face mask policies violate parental rights. The board will hold onto the funds until each school board complies with Gov. Ron DeSantis' now-overturned executive order."We're going to fight to protect parents' rights to make health care decisions for their children," Corcoran said in astatementMonday. "They know what is best for their children.""What's unacceptable is the politicians who have raised their right hands and pledged, under oath, to uphold the Constitution but are not doing so. Simply said, elected officials cannot pick and choose what laws they want to follow," Corcoran said.Localreportsindicate that several other school districts have implemented mask mandates, including Orange, Duval, Miami-Dade, Hillsborough, Sarasota, Palm Beach, Indian River and Leon counties. It is unclear whether school board members in those counties will also have their pay withheld.The bitter fight is playing out as a rash of coronavirus infections sweeps across Florida, including among children who are not eligible for vaccination. On Monday, officials reported18,608new cases.DeSantis' opposition stems from the lack of parental control. He argues that under existing Florida law, parents must be free to opt out of student mask requirements. However, the rules in place in Alachua and Broward counties only allow for a medical exemption from a doctor.DeSantis, who barred the mask mandates on July 30, warned that "there will be consequences" for districts that defy the ban.But on Friday, following a four-day trial, Judge John Cooperruled in favor of parentswho sued, arguing DeSantis overstepped his authority in forbidding the face covering requirement and said it cannot be enforced. He noted that face mask mandates that follow guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are "reasonable and consistent with the best scientific and medical opinion in this country."Cooper also added that DeSantis' order "is without legal authority."DeSantis is appealing the decision and on Monday called Cooper's ruling "obviously problematic."The decision to withhold funding from Alachua and Broward counties could open the state up to further legal troubles.On Monday, the U.S. Department of Education's Office of Civil Rightsannouncedit had launched an investigation into five states "exploring whether statewide prohibitions on universal indoor masking discriminate against students with disabilities."At the time, the office said it had refrained from opening investigations in Florida, Texas, Arkansas or Arizona "because those states' bans on universal indoor masking are not currently being enforced as a result of court orders or other state actions."However, officials said they would continue to monitor those states and take action "if state leaders prevent local schools or districts from implementing universal indoor masking or if the current court decisions were to be reversed."It is unclear if Florida's decision not to pay school board members will trigger an investigation. The Education Department did not immediately return NPR's requests for comment.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Michaeleen DoucleffAll around the world, there seem to be signs that immunity to SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes the disease COVID-19, doesn't last very long after you're vaccinated.Israel is nowhavingone of the world's worst COVID-19 surges about five months after vaccinating a majority of its population. And in the U.S., health officials are recommending a booster shot eight months after the original vaccine course.So, how long does immunity last after two doses of the vaccine? Six months or so? And at that point, how much protection is left over?It all depends on which type of immunity you're talking about, says immunologistAli Ellebedyat Washington University in St. Louis. Six months after your vaccine, your body may be more ready to fight off the coronavirus than you might think."If you were vaccinated six months ago, your immune system has been training for six months — you are better ready to fight a COVID-19 infection," says Ellebedy.A series of new studies, including two led by Ellebedy, suggests that mRNA vaccines like those from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna trigger the immune system to establish long-term protection against severe COVID-19 — protection that likely will last several years or even longer, Ellebedy says.To understand what he's talking about, let's say you received the second Moderna or Pfizer vaccine six months ago. Right away, your immune system got to work and began making antibodies.These antibodies are a bit like archers outside the moat of a castle. They set up in the lining of your nose and throat, ready to shoot down (aka neutralize) any SARS-CoV-2 particles that try to enter the moat (aka your nasal tissue).These antibodies canpreventan infection, says bioimmunologistDeepta Bhattacharyaat the University of Arizona. They stop the virus from entering cells and setting up shop. They are the body's front-line defense.But right after vaccination, this initial round of antibodies has a few problems. The antibodies are a bit wimpy. They're not that well trained at killing SARS-CoV-2, and they're not very durable, Bhattacharya says.About a month after the second mRNA shot, the number of antibodies in the blood reaches its peak level and then starts to decline. The antibodies themselves degrade and the cells that make them die, a studypublishedin the journalNaturereported in June.This happens with every vaccine, whether it's for COVID-19, the flu or measles, Bhattacharya says. "In every single immune response, there is a sharp rise in antibodies, a period of sharp decline, and then it starts to settle into a more stable nadir."The media has largely focused on this decline of antibodies as the cause of "waning immunity." And it's true, Bhattacharya says, that this decline in antibodies, combined with the high potency of the delta variant, which began dominating many countries this year, is likely increasing the rate of infection in fully vaccinated people."If you get a big dose of delta, as the variant often gives, the virus can slip past the initial wall of antibodies," he says. "So I think we may be seeing some signs of that. But the [level of breakthrough infections] is probably not as dramatic as I think it's being made out to be."Why? Because the media has largely overlooked several key facts about the antibodies present eight months after the vaccine. For starters, they're more powerful than the original ones triggered by the vaccine, Bhattacharya says.While the first round of archers (antibodies) was out guarding the moat of your castle (respiratory tract), the immune system wasn't just sitting around idly, hoping those soldiers would be enough. Instead, it was busy training better archers — and a whole bunch of foot soldiers too.After your second shot, the immune system sets up a training center in the lymph nodes to teach special cells how to make more powerful antibodies, theNaturepaper from Junereported."The quality of the antibody improves over time. It takes far fewer of those new antibodies to protect you," Bhattacharya says. "So I think that worrying about antibody decline is not something that's productive," he adds.At the same time, the cells that make these souped-up antibodies become souped up themselves, he adds. In the training center, they learn how to make a huge amount of the highly powerful antibodies."These cells are remarkable," Bhattacharya says. "They're estimated to spit out something like 10,000 antibody molecules per second." So you don't need many of these cells to protect you against a future infection."We've done some back-of-the-envelope calculations to figure out how many of these cells are needed to protect a mouse from a lethal infection. It's three," Bhattacharya says. "Of course, we're bigger than mice. But you get the sense that it doesn't take many to offer good protection."On top of that, these cells learn something remarkable in the training center: how to persist. "They're essentially given the gift of eternity," says immunologist Ellebedy.He and his colleagues have found that by about six months after vaccination, these antibody-producing cells go into the bone marrow, where they can live for decades, perhaps even a lifetime, studies havefound, and continue to produce antibodies the entire time. In one 2008study, researchers identified antibodies that could neutralize the 1918 flu in the blood of people who were exposed to the virus 90 years earlier."We looked in the bone marrow and haveseenthese cells in people previously infected with SARS-CoV-2," Ellebedy says. "Now we are finishing research that shows these cells appear in the bone marrow after vaccination as well."Called long-lived plasma cells, these cells will likely pump out antibodies into the blood for decades, Ellebedy says, giving people some sustained, long-term protection against SARS-CoV-2. (There is a caveat: If the virus changes too much, these antibodies won't be as effective.)"The antibodies are maintained at very low levels, but they're the first line of defense against an infection," Ellebedy says. "If you're taken by surprise by SARS-CoV-2, these antibodies will slow down the replication of the virus" — until reinforcements come along.And reinforcements will likely come!On top of training up better archers (antibodies) and factories to create them (plasma cells), the immune system has also been training up the equivalent of foot soldiers, several studies havefound. These foot soldiers are called memory B cells and memory T cells, and they largely serve as a surveillance system, looking for other cells infected with SARS-CoV-2."They're patrolling all over," Ellebedy says, checking to see if a cell has SARS-CoV-2 hiding in it. "It's almost like going through the neighborhood, house by house, and just making sure it's clean."These foot soldiers can't prevent an infection from initially occurring, but they can quickly stop one once it occurs, says immunologistJennifer Gommermanat the University of Toronto. "Because of the vaccine-generated 'memory' of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, you get a very brisk cellular immune response."OK. So now we've got all the information to understand what's going on with the COVID-19 vaccine and immune durability.About six months after the shots, the antibodies in the blood have fallen — as expected. They're also a bit less effective against the delta variant. "Together, that means there are more symptomatic infections as we go further out from the vaccination rollout," Gommerman says.But in vaccinated people, these infections will most likely be mild or moderate because the immune system isn't starting from scratch. In fact, it's the opposite. It has been training cells and antibodies for months."You still have all this immunity inside of your body that will then say, 'OK, we've had a breach, and it's time to bring in the cellular immunity and respond to this threat,' " Gommerman says. "And because of vaccination, you have cells that can do that really quickly."And so, overall, you'll be less sick than if you weren't vaccinated and be much less likely to end up in the hospital, she says."That's really what the vaccines were designed to do — to teach the immune system to deal with this invader if an infection does occur," Gommerman says. "And the vaccines do that remarkably well."Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Cory TurnerNashville, Tenn., kindergarten teacher Amber Updegrove leads her class in a lesson this month. On Monday, the U.S. Department of Education announced an investigation into Tennessee's requirement that schools allow families to opt out of mask mandates.John Partipilo/APhide captionNashville, Tenn., kindergarten teacher Amber Updegrove leads her class in a lesson this month. On Monday, the U.S. Department of Education announced an investigation into Tennessee's requirement that schools allow families to opt out of mask mandates.The U.S. Department of Educationsent a warningto five states on Monday that their statewide bans on mask mandates, including in schools, could violate students' civil rights. Suzanne B. Goldberg, the department's acting assistant secretary for civil rights, sent letters to state education leaders in Iowa, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee and Utah, informing them that the department's Office for Civil Rights is investigating whether their bans are discriminatory.At the center of the department's concerns, according to Monday's letters, are students with disabilities who may be at heightened risk for severe illness from COVID-19. Goldberg's letters say these investigations will focus on whether the state bans are discriminatory by preventing students with disabilities from safely returning to in-person education.Federal law "guarantees qualified students with disabilities the right to a free appropriate public education in elementary and secondary school," Goldberg wrote in each of the letters. "This includes the right of students with disabilities to receive their education in the regular educational environment, alongside their peers without disabilities, to the maximum extent appropriate to their needs."If students with disabilities do not feel safe returning to school because their classmates cannot be required to wear masks, the department's argument goes, then these bans could be considered discriminatory and violate either Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and/or Title II of the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990.The announcement comes after President Biden issued amemorandumon Aug. 18 in which he directed Education Secretary Miguel Cardona to ensure that "Governors and other officials are giving students the opportunity to participate and remain in safe full-time, in-person learning without compromising their health or the health of their families or communities."If the Education Department ultimately finds that these mask mandate bans do run afoul of federal civil rights law, it could threaten to withhold federal funding, though, on a recent appearance onNBC'sMeet the Press, Cardona conceded that this was less than ideal."When we talk about withholding funds, those who suffer are the students," Cardona said. "Withholding funds doesn't usually work. If anything, it adds insult to injury to these students who are trying to get into the classroom."The department says it is not at this time investigating other states with similar bans — including Texas, Florida, Arkansas and Arizona — because those bans are not currently being enforced, due to eithercourt ordersor other actions.In a statement to NPR, Oklahoma State Superintendent of Public Instruction Joy Hofmeister, an elected Republican, said she supports the investigation:"Regrettably, we are not surprised by this civil rights investigation spurred by passage of a state law prohibiting mask requirements in Oklahoma public schools. That law, Senate Bill 658, is preventing schools from fulfilling their legal duty to protect and provide all students the opportunity to learn more safely in-person. We will fully cooperate with USDE."In short, Hofmeister told NPR: "I want the law to be stricken."Utah's state superintendent of public instruction, Sydnee Dickson, said in a statement: "While we appreciate [the Office for Civil Rights'] efforts to protect children, specifically students with disabilities, we think they have unfairly defined Utah as a state where mask mandates cannot occur. State law places these decisions at the local level with local health departments and locally elected officials. ... We look forward to working with OCR to clarify Utah's position on the issue."Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Nina KravinskyDanny Reeves, senior pastor at First Baptist Corsicana in Texas, plans to share his experience with COVID-19 with his congregation and encourage everyone who's eligible to get vaccinated.Courtesy of Danny Reeveshide captionDanny Reeves, senior pastor at First Baptist Corsicana in Texas, plans to share his experience with COVID-19 with his congregation and encourage everyone who's eligible to get vaccinated.Last month, Pastor Danny Reeves was fighting for his life in the intensive care unit at Dallas' Baylor University Medical Center. He had COVID-19, and he wasn't vaccinated.Now, the senior pastor at First Baptist Corsicana in north central Texas regrets not getting the shot earlier, and he plans to tell his congregants his story on Sunday when he returns to the pulpit."I was falsely and erroneously overconfident," Reeves told NPR's Debbie Elliott onMorning Edition.Reeves says he isn't against vaccines, and he encouraged certain people in his community — mostly older adults — to get vaccinated before he contracted the coronavirus. But he thought since he's in his 40s and generally healthy, getting the virus wouldn't be a big deal.Unfortunately that was the attitude that I had: That if I did get it, I thought it would just be a nothing issue. And in that I was deeply, deeply wrong.Pastor Danny Reeves on why he didn't get a COVID-19 vaccine"Unfortunately that was the attitude that I had: That if I did get it, I thought it would just be a nothing issue," he says. "And in that I was deeply, deeply wrong."Reeves describes his experience at the hospital as "harrowing." At one point during his two-night stay in the ICU, a doctor told him he might die.Weeks later, Reeves is still recovering."It ravaged my healthy body," he said. "There's no doubt."COVID-19 cases are surging across north Texas, and projections indicate they may soon reach last winter's peak.Of his first service back, Reeves says, "We're going to praise God together for his rescue. I'm going to lay out lessons that I've learned. ... And certainly I'm going to talk straight to our people about who we can and should be as God's people and what it really means to love our neighbor."Reeves says he plans to get vaccinated once his doctor tells him it's safe to do so.This story originally appeared on theMorning Editionlive blog.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

It serves about nine counties on either side of the border.The Asante system encompasses three hospitals in the Rogue Valley — in the cities of Ashland, Medford and Grants Pass. All three intensive care units are 100% full of COVID-19 patients, according to staff."We've had two deaths today. So it's a very grim, difficult time," said Dr. Michael Blumhardt, the ICU medical director, on a recent Tuesday in August.In contrast to earlier phases of the pandemic, the Asante hospitals are now treating COVID-19 patients in their 20s, 30s, 40s and 50s, according to Blumhardt."We're seeing clusters of families being admitted. We had a father and an adult daughter admitted to the intensive care unit, and he passed away, right before, I had to put the daughter on life support," he said.Overall, vaccination rates in many states look pretty good. But zoom in, and you'll see a checkerboard effect with huge differences from county to county. Oregon is no different. In and around metro Portland, two-thirds of all residents are fully vaccinated. But rural counties aren't even close to that; many have vaccination rates less than 50% or even 40%. Jackson County, in southern Oregon, is home to the largest number of unvaccinated individuals in the state. That's pushing the local hospitals to the limit.Asante's Blumhardt blames the current surge on the highly transmissible delta variant but also on widespread rejection of the coronavirus vaccine in this area."This is far more severe for this region than the prior COVID waves," he said. "The delta virus is passing through the region like a buzz saw."Inside the Asante ICU in Medford, Chelsea Orr, a registered nurse, is closely monitoring patients."We're taking care of a lot of ventilated patients here that are super sick," Orr said.What feels different about this stage of the pandemic, she added, is the incredible loss of life."It's been really hard. We're working harder than we've ever worked before and still losing," Orr said.Another ICU nurse, Justin McCoy, agrees."I've been an ICU nurse for 10 years. I've never seen anything like this," McCoy said. "It's really terrible seeing these patients who can't breathe. That is a very difficult thing to watch. It's really terrifying for them, and it's really difficult for us to see day in and day out."Blumhardt said the vast majority of patients at Asante are unvaccinated."We admit nine unvaccinated to every one vaccinated individual," he said. "So clearly the vaccine is protecting against hospital admission."Jackson County is recording record numbers of coronavirus infections. Within weeks, many of those people may worsen and need hospital care. Unfortunately, a new forecast from Oregon Health & Science University predicts that by Labor Day, the state will face a shortfall of 400 to 500 staffed hospital beds.Blumhardt said smaller hospitals in Oregon have been trying to transfer their sickest patients to Asante, but so far they've had to turn away around 200 people because they don't have the beds or the staff.Even though Asante has already postponed some surgeries, staffers are simply worn out, said emergency room physician Courtney Wilson."I think people are frustrated," Wilson said. "It feels discouraging that we have had a vaccine available for a really long time in this community and we have a really low vaccination rate here."This month, Oregon Gov. Kate Brown sent National Guard troops to overwhelmed counties to help with nonclinical tasks, such as cleaning hospital rooms, moving medical supplies and traffic control. Some 150 soldiers were dispatched to southern Oregon. Medical leaders at Asante and Providence, the other hospital system in Rogue Valley, have teamed up to ask the state to set up a 300-bed field hospital. The state has also finalized a contract todeployhundreds of medical "crisis teams" of nurses, respiratory therapists and paramedics from medical staffing companies to overwhelmed hospitals."I don't know how we're going to get everybody taken care of. That's the bottom line,"  Blumhardt said. "We're all hands on deck at every level of the organization."Residents of Jackson County are starting to respond to the crisis. The rate of newvaccinations here has grown and is now about twice that of the Portland area. But thousands of people still need to be vaccinated to catch up.This story was produced as part of NPR's reporting partnership with Jefferson Public Radio and Kaiser Health News.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

It was the first global ceasefire appeal since the agency was founded in 1945, in the aftermath of World War II. "The fury of the virus illustrates the folly of war," Guterres said. "End the sickness of war and fight the disease that is ravaging our world."On the ground, little changed. More than a dozen armed groups, from the National Liberation Army in Colombia to the Communist Party of the Philippines,initially endorsedGuterres' appeal, but most offers to lay down arms were either one-sided or did not culminate in a formal ceasefire agreement. A U.N. Security Council resolution that July, which affirmed Guterres' plea, also went nowhere. By fall 2020, the idea of a global ceasefire — which, in all of world history, has never taken place — was off the table.On Feb. 26, 2021, the Security Council tried another tack. It passedResolution 2565, which less ambitiously but more pragmatically called for a "sustained humanitarian pause" in order to immunize the world. In this case, there were recent historical precedents: In the 1960s, representatives from the World Health Organization launched its intensified program to eradicate smallpox — focusing on countries such as Ethiopia and present-day Bangladesh, where the disease was endemic and where public health officials had to work around conflicts in order to bring lifesaving vaccines to civilians.This triumph of public health diplomacy will have to occur once again, humanitarian professionals say, in order to bring the COVID-19 pandemic to an end. FromAfghanistanto Myanmar,Nigeriato Azerbaijan, people caught amid violence and instability will need to be immunized. Public health experts fear that if conflict zones don't receive vaccines soon, these places could become hot spots for transmission and incubators for potentially dangerous variants of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.But hammering out temporary ceasefires won't be easy. The political situation is more complex now than in the past, in part because of the abundance of nonstate actors like al-Qaida and the self-proclaimed Islamic State that control large swaths of land, and are not necessarily eager to give governments credit for vaccination campaigns. Additionally, public health officials say, vaccine hesitancy and other pressing needs threaten to sabotage vaccination efforts. In Afghanistan, where the Taliban hasrecently taken over, COVID-19 vaccinations have alreadyslowed.Still, humanitarian negotiators are pressing ahead. "That's the reality of our profession — that we never give up," said Katia Papagianni, director for mediation support and policy at the Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue, a Swiss-based private diplomacy organization. These negotiations are informed by the growing recognition that, in order to successfully broker timeouts in fighting for "humanitarian access," mediators must engage with teachers, respected elders, women's groups, local businesspeople and other community leaders."It is not rocket science," Charles Deutscher, a policy adviser for the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), wrote on the organization's Humanitarian Law & Policyblogin March. "It's investing time and showing empathy — drink more tea, sit with people and listen to them to understand their concerns, cultures and creeds before coming at them with a needle."And when it comes to dealing with warring factions, those in the field say it's essential to stay politically neutral and to continually nurture the conditions for peace. "You literally have to negotiate every day," said Papagianni. "You may negotiate every morning and every afternoon, if that's what's needed."Dee Goluba, senior director of field security for the humanitarian aid organization Mercy Corps, added that conflict parties will only allow aid workers access who have proven themselves to be outside of the fray, completely impartial. Humanitarian personnel must be "perceived as not helping the other combatants," she said. "Trust is everything."Though the WHO's smallpox eradication campaign was not history's first global vaccination drive — that honor belongs to the Spanish government's worldwide immunization effort against smallpox, which began in 1803 and deployed Edward Jenner's early vaccine — the WHO's program was the first and only to eradicate a human infectious disease.Smallpox was the ideal target, in large measure for reasons that distinguish it from COVID-19. The smallpox virus can only be spread by people, meaning there were no hidden animal reservoirs, unlike the various species of bats and other mammals that harbor strains of coronavirus that have jumped to humans. Smallpox's symptoms were distinct and easy to identify, and the virus was not spread by asymptomatic carriers. There was a stable and highly effective vaccine. And smallpox lesions, which could scar a victim for life, were universally feared, regardless of politics. The United States and the Soviet Union — bitter Cold War adversaries — joined forces to rid the world of the disease.Even with these advantages, expunging smallpox from the planet was a formidable undertaking. "It required the cooperation of all countries throughout the world and the active participation of more than 50," wrote the campaign's director, the legendary Donald A. Henderson, in 2011. The final push of smallpox eradication — one of the landmark achievements in public health — took place from 1976 to 1977 and had to work around wars in Ethiopia and Somalia.In 1995, former President Jimmy Carter negotiated the Guinea Worm Ceasefire during a fierce civil war in Sudan. The nearly six-month-long pause in fighting was, at that time, the longest humanitarian ceasefire in history. It enabled health workers to care for those suffering from Guinea worm disease, agruesome parasitic infection, and distribute aid and preventive health measures.Perhaps the most fitting contemporary precedent was the 1980s launch of a series of pauses in fighting to facilitate childhood immunization campaigns. The first attempt was in 1985 in El Salvador, a country then in the throes of an ongoing civil war. UNICEF director James Grant was inspired by the concept of "children as a zone of peace," which called for children to be protected in conflict zones — an ideal he thought even antagonists with guns could agree on. Shuttling between the government of then-president José Napoleón Duarte and the Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front rebels, and relying on support from the Catholic Church, Grant negotiated three "days of tranquility" — temporal islands of calm that allowed health workers to immunize children against polio, measles, diphtheria, tetanus and whooping cough. Those first three days saw at least 250,000 children receive vaccinations; the pause in fighting occurred every year through 1991, dramatically reducing the incidence of measles and tetanus and helping eradicate polio in the country.The "days of tranquility" model was taken up by the Pan American Health Organization for its Health as a Bridge for Peace program, which drew on effective communications and broad partnerships with local communities around planning and vaccine rollout to ensure success; the framework was adapted by the WHO for other parts of the world. During cessations of hostilities in the 1980s and 1990s, standard immunizations reached children in countries including Afghanistan, Cambodia, Lebanon and Sudan.In 2021, the notion of COVID-19 "days of tranquility" seems inconceivable. That's because most armed conflicts of late are waged not between countries but within the boundaries of nation-states, according to a 2018reportfrom the Peace Research Institute Oslo. The ICRC estimates that more than 50 million people live in territories fully controlled by armed nonstate authorities, and some 100 million live in areas where control by these groups is more fluid.This breed of conflict is protracted and open-ended. An ICRCassessmentin 2016 found that the average length of time the agency spent in the countries hosting its 10 largest operations was more than 36 years. As of August, the organization counted 605 armed groups in 44 nations that posed a concern to its humanitarian work; ICRC negotiators have maintained contact with 415 of these groups. Experts from the organization noted in March that "in some of the most complex recent conflicts, analysts have observedhundreds, if not thousands" of armed contingents present in a single country.These groups "rapidly factionalize; opposing sides lack the funds or command structure to achieve definitive dominance; the conflicts multiply and move across populated terrain; and the fighting drags on for decades,"saidJennifer Leaning, a senior research fellow and former director of the François-Xavier Bagnoud Center for Health and Human Rights at Harvard University, at a workshop on mental health in the Middle East in 2014. Nowadays, she continued, it's clear that "the primary pattern of war is intrastate, communalized or sectarian. These conflicts are waged by nonstate actors untrained in or dismissive of the laws of war, or are waged by oppressive, brittle or failing states against stigmatized groups of their own citizens or residents."A girl in Afghanistan is vaccinated against smallpox in the 1970s, a part of the WHO's smallpox eradication campaign.P. Almasy/WHO Photohide captionA girl in Afghanistan is vaccinated against smallpox in the 1970s, a part of the WHO's smallpox eradication campaign.Hichem Khadhraoui, director of operations for Geneva Call — a humanitarian non-governmental organization focused on protecting civilians in armed conflict — borrowed, consciously or not, a word from current public health headlines to describe the situation. "The conflicts aremutating," he said in an interview posted to the organization's website. Negotiators for the ICRC, for example, may need to parley with 10 different commanders harboring 10 different opinions along a 10-kilometer road, said Esperanza Martinez, head of the organization's COVID-19 crisis team — a cast of combatants that, according to Khadhraoui, may change completely from one year to the next.Such shape-shifting dampens the prospects of pandemic peace. "Who stands to benefit? I mean that's always what it comes down to, especially in ceasefire negotiations: pretty cynical cost-benefit analysis on the side of the conflict parties," said Tyler Jess Thompson, a senior expert on negotiations and peace process support at the United States Institute of Peace, a nonpartisan institute founded by Congress. "If you have a territory that's controlled by a nonstate armed group or a rebel group, more likely than not, the rebel group will welcome some kind of humanitarian assistance," he said, explaining that it can boost their legitimacy. "The flip side challenge to that is a government party not wanting rebel-controlled territory to be seen as governed or services being provided there. So there's a legitimacy battle.""You have this very kind of difficult situation that we have in front of us now of who gets the credit for bringing in the vaccines," said Govinda Clayton, executive director of the Conflict Research Society. "It might be that, in the end, both parties decide it's just in both of their best interest just to continue fighting and not allow the vaccination campaign to happen, because they don't lose anything by doing that and they don't let the other side gain anything."Some United Nations policies may be making the situation worse. February's Security Council Resolution2565explicitly excludes pandemic pauses in military operations against terrorist groups such as al-Qaida and the Islamic State. Many humanitarian organizations think that's a bad idea. "COVID-19 should reinforce the notion that, even when living under the control of armed groups and governments categorized by other states as terrorist, criminal or rogue, civilians remain simply that: civilians," noted areportpublished by the ICRC earlier this year."My personal opinion is that in order to solve COVID-19-related problems, humanitarian actors should engage with the authorities of these armed nonstate actors on the distribution of the vaccine," said Ezequiel Heffes, a senior policy and legal adviser at Geneva Call. But, he conceded, "This is where law and politics kind of split." According to international law, each party to a conflict is obliged to ensure that everyone within the territories it controls gets access to basic health care. But politically, some government authorities may not want to allot precious vaccines to people who seek to overthrow them.Other observers questioned the secretary-general's rhetorical attempt to tie the humanitarian goal of providing aid to the political goal of promoting peace. "The more decoupled that can be, the better," said Thompson.NGOs that work in conflict zones draw a glaringly bright line between politics and humanitarianism. "Humanitarian actors are very, very attentive to the importance of maintaining the space, what they call the 'humanitarian space.' And that means ensuring that they will never be accused of being partial to one side or another," Papagianni said. The four fundamental principles of humanitarianism are humanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence. This distinction and distancing from politics has become "even more acute the past few years," Papagianni noted, "given the fact that major humanitarian actors have been attacked in the field."Areportfrom the Safeguarding Health in Conflict Coalition found that 185 health workers died in conflict settings in 2020, more than in either of the previous two years. It also cited more than 400 attacks on health care efforts that specifically responded to the pandemic. In these incidents, health care workers "were abused, injured, threatened and harassed, and health facilities were attacked, damaged and/or set on fire," according to the report. Violence against health care efforts erupted, among other places, inAfghanistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, India, Mexico, Syria and Yemen.Another stumbling block to pandemic ceasefires is that civilians and combatants alike face threats that they regard as far more urgent than the coronavirus. In most areas affected by conflict, the leading causes of death are not combat-related but rather theindirect consequencesof war: malnutrition, chronic diseases that go untreated because of failing public health programs and common childhood infections, to name a few.Consider the catastrophe in Yemen, where the world's worst humanitarian crisis has been dragging on for years amid a vicious civil war. More than 100,000 people have been killed and 3.6 million displaced as a result of the conflict, according to a report written by Thompson for theUnited States Institute of Peace. The country has suffered the worst documented cholera epidemic in recorded history, with more than2.5 millionsuspected cases since the outbreak began in 2016. Mothers and children are dying from preventable complications during pregnancy and birth. Famine is bearing down, with tens of thousands of people starving to death and another 5 millionon the brink. In May 2020, according toThe Lancet,of an estimated 30 million Yemenis, 24 million — 80% of the population — needed humanitarian assistance.Yemen's ordeal transcends COVID-19. At the same time, the humanitarian disaster and the war that accelerated it have obstructed the pandemic response. Yemen's health system has been shattered by fighting, economic collapse and a recent shortfall in humanitarian funding. The Houthi movement based in the north — which has been fighting the pro-government coalition and controls Sanaa, the constitutional capital — has downplayed the coronavirus threat, withheld data on cases and deaths, and undermined international efforts to provide vaccines in areas under their control. Before agreeing to accept 10,000 vaccine doses, "one of the conditions the Houthi authorities set was that there should be no media coverage or social mobilization for a vaccination campaign," noted a Junearticlefrom Human Rights Watch, a non-governmental organization that tracks human rights abuses around the world. "As of writing, the vaccination campaign hasn't happened in the north," it said.On the same day in 2020 that the U.N.'s Guterres made his ceasefire appeal, a small Yemeni organization called Food for Humanity Foundation issued its own desperate ceasefirecall. "With the world being engulfed in the coronavirus pandemic, the little attention that the Yemen war is getting has all but disappeared," it said. "But the war itself has not."Yemeni children from families who are affected by the war talk to a worker to receive their lunch meals at a charitable center in April.

Tens of thousands of the country's people are starving to death and another 5 million are on the brink.Yemenis are not alone in objectively weighing the threat of COVID-19 against other perils. In Mali last year, after gunmen struck villages and killed at least 12 civilians, a local mayor said, "What is killing us isn't coronavirus, but war." This past February, a Somali cattle herder, who has lived most of his life in a region controlled by Islamist insurgents, toldReuters: "Before we get the vaccine, we need other things. We need food, water, health care and shelter. Our people are dying because of the basics in life. We will need the vaccine when we are liberated, now we are basically under siege."Syria has been ravaged by 10 years of conflict and spent 21 years under the authoritarian rule of President Bashar al-Assad. According to a commentary published in April inThe Lancet, since the beginning of the conflict in 2011, more than 585,000 people have died, child life expectancy has dropped by 13 years, more than half of the country's pre-conflict population has been displaced and at least half of public hospitals and public health centers are either "partly functioning or not functioning at all as of November 2020." Other reports from the Syrian American Medical Society note thatalmost 80%of Syrians live in poverty andthree-quarters of health care workershave either left the country or been killed. Astudylast fall by Imperial College London estimated that only 1.25% of COVID-19 deaths are being reported in Damascus. Not surprisingly, coronavirus cases are now surging. As an article last year inNewlines Magazineforetold, "Syria appears to be headed into a desultory experiment with herd immunity."Syrian feminist activist Hanadi Alloush said that many women in northern Syria whom she's spoken with don't even know about COVID-19 vaccines. She also underscored the near-collapse of the country's health system, the precarious fate of internally displaced people and the silence surrounding COVID-19 — a silence that has descended, she said, because civilians living in areas controlled by the Assad regime fear that if they so much as mention the virus by name, they will be detained. "What I want to share is that it is a very complicated situation that is beyond COVID," Alloush said, speaking through a translator. "A more holistic approach to address it is needed."Part of that holistic approach, for all conflict zones, is public health support for non-pandemic emergencies. For example, humanitarian officials want to piggyback COVID-19 vaccinations on top of standard childhood immunizations, which have been severely interrupted by the pandemic. Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, a global health partnership that aims to provide vaccinations to poor countries, estimated last year that10.6 million childrenhad not received a single dose of basic vaccinations in 2019, before the pandemic made the shots even more difficult. Measles — a vaccine-preventable disease that mostly kills children under the age of 5 — hit a 23-year global high in 2019, killing200,000. According to a Marchreportfrom the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, as of October 2020, 30 countries had "either fully or partially postponed" vaccine campaigns against measles during the pandemic. And according to theCDC, 41 nations have either "already put off, or may put off" their measles immunizations campaigns that had been scheduled for 2020 or 2021."For the last couple of years, Congo has been facing its largest measles epidemic," said Maria Guevara, the international medical secretary at Doctors Without Borders (also known as MSF). She added that a recent outbreak in the northwest of the country prompted MSF to run, amid coronavirus spread, measles vaccination campaigns. "That was their issue, not COVID," she said. "Measles were the thing, because kids were dying." And that's setting aside the country's other recent crises: Ebola, malaria, a volcanic eruption andscoresof volcano-triggered earthquakes."It's a balancing act," said Guevara. "We need to just remember that in many parts of the world, COVID is not the only problem they're facing, unfortunately."Vaccine hesitancy could also impede pandemic ceasefires, experts say. The hesitancy is partly driven by mistrust in public authorities in places where long-standing corruption or abuses of power have amplified political grievances. Such mistrust was a major hurdle in containing the Ebola epidemic which emerged in West Africa seven years ago.Misinformation is false or inaccurate information that is spread, regardless of the intent to mislead. Disinformation is false or misleading information that is deliberately disseminated. Both abound in places of instability. "Part of it is the globalization of the anti-vaccine movement. That has thrown a lot of cold water on immunization programs and has worked to discredit them or devalue them," said Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine and author of the new bookPreventing the Next Pandemic.Falsehoods come in many forms. InNigeria, some believe that both COVID-19 and its vaccines were engineered to wipe out Africans. InSomalia, the militant group al-Shabab has rejected the AstraZeneca vaccine as unsafe and has instead prescribed black seed and honey for COVID-19 sufferers. InSyria, a state-run radio station assured listeners that the coronavirus "loses potency in the Middle East's hot climate," according toNewlines Magazine. Meanwhile, inMyanmar, some citizens have decided to forego immunizations, not because of weaponized disinformation, but because the vaccines would be delivered by a military government that has in recent months killed hundreds of civilians.Delays in vaccine production and distribution pose an additional challenge. While affluent nations pre-purchased more than enough doses to fully protect their populations, the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access initiative, or COVAX, isdesperately short of doses, and those it has acquired have not always reached the places that need it most. COVAX's distribution model is based on an equity paradigm. Theplanis for the partnership's 92 low- and middle-income countries to receive proportionally similar allotments that would cover 20% of their populations. It prioritizes health care workers and other vulnerable groups first, with additional vaccine doses to follow as they become available. A "humanitarian buffer" of up to 5% of available doses will be set aside for certain populations — such as those living outside government-controlled areas.According to a JunereportinThe Lancet, of the 2.1 billion vaccine doses administered globally by that point, COVAX had facilitated less than 4%. As of July, COVAXestimatesto have some 1.9 billion doses available for distribution by the end of the year, though this volume is not guaranteed. If the plan goes forward, COVAX should be able to reach at least 23% of the populations in 91 of those 92 low- and middle-income countries. (India was excluded from that estimate but will receive a "tailored package of support.") But 23% protection still leaves these nations well short of the coverage they need to achieve herd immunity.At a National Press Club event in March, Mercy Corps CEO Tjada D'Oyen McKenna warned that the longer vaccines are delayed in reaching conflict-affected countries, the greater the risk for violence within those nations' borders. Mercy Corps teams have also seen that measures intended to curb the pandemic's spread have unintentionally fueled conflict, she said: "Government responses to the pandemic, including lockdowns and border closures, are fraying community trust; misinformation is proliferating; and competition for resources has intensified."Conflict areas harbor the very conditions that promote viral spread. They are crowded. They may lack basic sanitation and health services. And people are on the move, often fleeing for their lives. "Getting displacement sites set up — water access, food, provisions — can take time," said Jennifer Chan, the director of global emergency medicine at Northwestern Medicine. "And knowing what we now know of COVID, that can increase the risk for transmission.""The virus has a mutation rate that's almost clock-like," said Caroline Buckee, associate director of the Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. The more that the airborne SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted, the greater the risk that new — possibly more virulent, or more contagious — strains will evolve.According to Buckee, an infectious disease modeler, it will be difficult to monitor new variants' circulation. Buckee's work depends on sound data: particularly, accurate viral sampling. Obtaining those samples requires a robust surveillance system — another casualty of war. "Without surveillance, you can't do models," she said. "In places where the health system is damaged or almost destroyed, surveillance is out the window." In the COVID-19 pandemic, she later added, that's been a defining feature: "You can't trust the data, especially the case data."Chan, who has worked for years on humanitarian programming in disaster areas, added that poor internet connectivity in conflict zones makes it difficult to send out for expert analysis whatever data does exist.Health workers carry supplies as a part of the COVAX vaccination campaign in May in Goma, Democratic Republic of the Congo. In recent years, Congo has also faced a large measles epidemic and outbreaks of Ebola.Guerchom Ndebo/Getty Imageshide captionHealth workers carry supplies as a part of the COVAX vaccination campaign in May in Goma, Democratic Republic of the Congo. In recent years, Congo has also faced a large measles epidemic and outbreaks of Ebola.Many public health experts fear that conflict zones will end up on the bottom of the global vaccine distribution list, because it is more problematic and more expensive to reach these places. If pockets of COVID-19 cannot be contained, they could spawn no-go zones around the world reminiscent of off-limits locales going back a century or more, said Leaning, the senior research fellow from Harvard. "It will be like the world was post-World War II to about 1970 — and certainly, actually, throughout much of the 19th century as well — where if you wanted to go to regions that were remote, you had to prepare to die from contagious or infectious disease." In 19th-century British India, for example, endemic malaria, plague, cholera and leprosy were major threats, while yellow fever and malaria on the West African coast helped give rise to the odious epithet "the White man's grave."Claude Bruderlein, director of the Geneva-based Center of Competence on Humanitarian Negotiation, wants to change COVAX's equity model to one based on efficiency, prioritizing areas prone to major outbreaks. War zones and otherwise fragile states are precisely where alarming variants could develop, "but they are the last ones on the list," he said. "When are they going to vaccinate in Afghanistan?" he asked back in May, when battles between government troops and the Taliban were in a brutal phase, but the fundamentalist organization had not yet overrun the country. According toOur World in Data, a project of the nonprofitGlobal Data Change Lab, as of Aug. 11, only 0.6% of Afghans have been fully immunized against COVID-19. "This is a petri dish for variants," Bruderlein said.Bruderlein also pointed out that many of today's conflict zones lack clear borders — meaning that people and the viruses they harbor can move around. He worries, for example, about Cox's Bazar in Bangladesh. With a population of nearly 900,000, it is the world's largest refugee settlement, housing in numerous camps mostly Rohingya who fled from neighboring Myanmar. "Five people in three square meters," Bruderlein said. If Bangladesh's health system collapses, the refugees in Cox's Bazar will simply leave.According to Bruderlein, the same is true in most of the Horn of Africa and the Sahel, the semi-arid belt of land that lies between the Sahara to the north and savannas to the south. Here, state control is often nonexistent and some of the most protracted conflicts in the world are playing out. "The border doesn't exist, basically," he said. "You have hundreds of thousands of people moving over a few weeks."When the U.N. Security Council passed Resolution 2565 this year, calling for pauses in fighting to conduct mass vaccinations, it was, in effect, a green light for humanitarian agencies to do what they do best. "In contrast to the secretary-general's 'global ceasefire' idea in 2020, which was a welcome but ultimately quixotic appeal, Resolution 2565's focus on vaccination campaigns is rooted in decades of humanitarian action," Richard Gowan, U.N. director at the International Crisis Group, wrote inApril.Humanitarian professionals are primed for the task. But in conflict zones, their work requires earning and sustaining the confidence of all sides — coincidentally, the very same requisites for successful public health campaigns. "Localized approaches to conflict resolution are now widely accepted as the gold standard for building peace," wrote Amanda Long and Tyler Beckelman in a United States Institute of Peacecommentarylast fall. In his March post on the ICRC blog, Deutscher wrote: "Community engagement takes time, effort and money." That interpersonal investment, he said, is as important as cold-chain management — storing the vaccine under proper temperatures from the time it is manufactured until it is administered — and fielding enough qualified health workers.Although Mercy Corps is not currently conducting broad-scale COVID-19 vaccination campaigns, the NGO has gleaned trust-building lessons from the past. According to Dee Goluba, it means reaching out to parent-teacher associations, soccer teams, Muslim clerics and many others. "We employ women who are local — mothers and daughters, schoolteachers — and we engage with women in our work on a day-to-day basis," she said. "Once you get mothers on board, the sons come on board, often. Once the sons are on board, their friends have a dialogue that makes its way to combatants, it makes its way within the community." The goal, Goluba said, is to sow accurate, science-based information throughout the local population.Alloush, the Syrian activist, knows the dynamics of homegrown conversations firsthand. She directs the social and women's program at Damma Foundation, a community-based women's network founded in Syria but now based in Lebanon, where she has lived since seeking refuge from the war in 2015. Its mission is to support women engaged in peacebuilding and to provide humanitarian aid, education and relief services.Between 2015 and 2017, Alloush said, Damma was active in the small mountain town of Madaya, Syria, which had been under siege for months by Syrian government forces and Hezbollah militia fighters — a total blockade that broughtstarvationand other horrors. Negotiating with suppliers that monopolized local trade, Damma volunteers helped bring in essential supplies — baby formula, milk, flour — according to Alloush. In 2012, in the nearby town of Zabadani, Damma contributed to temporary ceasefire negotiations that called for a halt to random sniping. The volunteers were able to achieve these demands, Alloush explained, because they were not perceived by combatants as acting out of self-aggrandizing motives. "Women, yes, they are the peacemakers," she said. "All our demands were purely civilian. We didn't have any military asks."Young people, too, may have a role to play in vaccination campaigns — yielding another kind of peace dividend. "If you've got lots of young men and women putting their energy into the common good," such as vaccinating thousands of local people, "that's a really creative and pro-peace activity for them to be doing," said Hugo Slim, former head of policy and humanitarian diplomacy at the ICRC, and now a senior research fellow at the Institute of Ethics, Law and Armed Conflict at the University of Oxford.He cited surges of youthful altruism in places such as Nigeria, South Sudan and Yemen. "It'll be the young people who do all this," Slim said, "because there's so many of them and because they're the ones that are going to have the energy and the agility and commitment to put on a Red Cross vest or a Caritas vest or an Islamic Relief vest," and help their local health service "for days and days and days."Leaning can envision a grassroots network of competent volunteers to help administer the vaccine. Locals with deep roots in the community — from schoolteachers and students to long-haul tradesmen and women vendors in the market — could be trained to assist in immunization campaigns, with dedicated health workers on the ground to supervise and follow strict cold storage and distribution guidelines. All you need, Leaning said, is simply "any cadre of people who have an ethic of caring for a population."In the 17 months since António Guterres linked the "fury of the virus" and the "folly of war," a shadow has crossed the globe. On the viral side of the ledger, as of Aug. 24, the world has seen more than 212 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 4.4 million deaths. On the war side, according to theArmed Conflict Location & Event Data Project, political violence killed nearly 90,000 people in 2020 alone.Did Guterres' poetic plea make any difference at all?"Secretary-generals of the U.N. have to give those lofty calls. We know that very often, they're sort of calling into the abyss, as it were. But when they make that call, it does help give people an idea, potentially change a discussion, an environment," Slim said. "Even if, out of 50 conflicts, his call helps two conflicts to come to some arrangement — you know, that's good. That's good."The fact that Guterres even broached the idea of a global ceasefire could have deeper reverberations. "The more you keep talking about these ideas — that you can have humanitarian ceasefires, that there are these things called humanitarian pauses — the more you keep them as real and as normal and as possible," Slim said. "If you never talk about them, they disappear from being options." When the next inevitable pandemic strikes, he added, people could point to instructive ceasefire precedents from today's crisis.Esperanza Martinez, the ICRC COVID-19 crisis team head, grew up in Colombia, where, since the mid-1960s, violence has raged between the government, far-right paramilitary groups, crime syndicates and far-left guerilla groups. By some accounts, the civil war claimedmore than 260,000 lives.In the 1990s, Martinez earned her medical degree in the capital, Bogotá, where, she said, bombings were a fact of life in the narcotics trade and the war against drugs. To cap her medical training, she was sent to a rural community in the southern part of the country. The town was under the control of the army, but a few kilometers away, down by the river, it was ruled by left-wing guerillas. Martinez said she had to cross the frontlines of war to negotiate the safe passage of wounded patients.What has stayed with her from her upbringing, and from her work as a medical doctor, she said, "is the deep appreciation for the resilience of people." Amid violence and deprivation, "They still send their children to school," she said. "They still hope to have a better future."Martinez was grateful for the secretary-general's 2020 ceasefire call, "because anything that allows to diminish the suffering of people affected by armed conflict is very welcome," she said. But she harbors no illusions about the tangible results of Guterres' plea. "The reality is that, if we look at what has happened during COVID," armed conflict has not decreased, she lamented. "We have Nagorno-Karabakh, we have Tigray, we have devastating attacks in Afghanistan, we have growing violence in Iraq, persistent violence in Yemen. So wherever you look, really, the situation hasn't diminished." Indeed, she said, fighting has escalated in many places.Martinez believes it's crucial to support these conflict-plagued regions — not only with COVID-19 vaccines, but with health care services, education, jobs and long-term investment in development programs that will eliminate the drivers of poverty, violence and migration. "Just work on the root causes — on inequality," she said. Today's disparity in vaccine distribution, she suggested, is merely one glaring example among many such inequities: "One thing that COVID has done is to underline that, disregarding of where we live, we are all exposed and we are in all of this together."This story originally appeared inUndark,a non-profit, editorially independent digital magazine exploring the intersection of science and society.

NPR's Scott Simon speaks to Dr. Krishna Udayakumar, Director of the Duke Global Health Innovation Center, about inequities in global vaccine access.SCOTT SIMON, HOST:Booster shots are ahead for millions of Americans who are already vaccinated. Pfizer is seeking FDA approval for a third dose that would bolster the vaccine's effectiveness, which they say wanes after eight months. But most people in the world still wait for their first shot. The Duke Global Health and Innovation Center found that the world's 92 poorest countries won't be able to reach a vaccination rate of 60% until 2023 or more. Dr. Krishna Udayakumar is director of that center and he joins us now. Dr. Udayakumar, thanks so much for being with us.KRISHNA UDAYAKUMAR: Hi, Scott. Good to be with you.SIMON: From what you see, what does the global vaccine distribution landscape appear to be like?UDAYAKUMAR: Well, we now have multiple safe and effective vaccines, but we are in extreme challenged position when we think about access to those vaccines, depending on where you live in the world. In the U.S., we're talking about more than half of all Americans that are fully vaccinated. And yet if you look at the entire continent of Africa, less than 3% of that population has that same ability to be fully vaccinated.SIMON: COVAX is the global program that was supposed to deliver vaccines to low- and middle-income countries, but its distribution target has fallen behind. What are some of the reasons?UDAYAKUMAR: COVAX was a very well-intentioned attempt to make sure that we were thinking about equity and access for the poorest countries in the world. It has now raised enough money to be able to go out and buy over 2 billion doses of vaccine. The problem now is they can't get access to those vaccines because high-income countries and the upper-middle-income countries in the world have gotten to the line faster to get access to the vaccines as they're being produced.SIMON: Is that because they pay more?UDAYAKUMAR: It's partially because they paid more. It's also partially because they invested very early into the research and development of the vaccines. And we've seen that the site of manufacturing really makes a difference. So high-income countries have manufacturing, like in the U.S., like parts of Europe. And we've seen the U.S. and others start to apply export restrictions to make sure that their own populations got earlier access to vaccines.SIMON: The World Health Organization has said that booster shot shouldn't be given while much of the world hasn't gotten even one vaccination. But I have to ask, does that really add up? If someone in America doesn't get a booster shot, does that really make it available for someone elsewhere in the world?UDAYAKUMAR: The real picture is much more complex. What we're seeing is that the supply is ramping up considerably. In the next two or three months, we're going to be producing almost a billion doses of vaccine every month. So hopefully, we can reasonably roll out boosters and do even more to make sure that we're getting vaccines to the rest of the world at the same time because we still have at least tens of millions of unused vaccines in the U.S., some of them at risk of expiring. And those can't be taken back and shipped overseas. So it's not exactly the case that every single dose here takes away a dose somewhere else.SIMON: The U.S. has pledged to send 500 million doses of vaccine overseas to help people, which is more than China or Russia or any other country. What more can the U.S. be doing?UDAYAKUMAR: The problem is that response doesn't really match either the scope or the urgency of the global situation. The world needs more than 10 billion doses to put an end to this pandemic. So we need stronger leadership from the U.S. We need to make sure that we're getting more doses out more quickly, that we're helping other countries build up their own manufacturing capacity and, really importantly, that low- and middle-income countries see capacity and investment to build up their distribution and delivery systems. It would be a real shame if in two or three months, we started to see supply really increase, and we don't have the systems in place in order to get them where they need to go and turn them into vaccinations.SIMON: Doctor, what about those Americans or Europeans who might be thinking, well, I think what's happening overseas is terrible, but it's got nothing to do with us?UDAYAKUMAR: This terrible surge we're suffering from in the U.S. is largely from the delta variant, which emerged in a place where we didn't have control of infections around the world. The idea of boosters is very much a temporizing measure. We can't just keep going with boosters in the U.S. and ignore the rest of the world. It's really a matter of time until we see more and more variants emerge, one of which will surely pierce our vaccine immunity. And then we're back to square one.SIMON: Dr. Krishna Udayakumar, director of the Duke Global Health Innovation Center, thanks so much for being with us.UDAYAKUMAR: Thank you.Copyright © 2021 NPR.

When breath, the embodiment of life, becomes the carrier of death, a mask becomes literally a matter of life and death.In April 2020, Blanca Cárdenas and Carlos Dávila, professors of ethnology at the National School of Anthropology and History (ENAH) in Mexico City, invited indigenous artisans in their country to create masks, drawings and other works of art to portray the agent of the pandemic — the coronavirus — through the lens of their traditions. The project, as its title suggests, aims at "Putting a Face on the Virus." So far, their collection includes 14 masks of wood and other materials, numerous painted cloth masks, drawings and special cut-out figures made of paper. We spoke to Cárdenas and Dávila by Zoom. The interview is edited for length and clarity."COVID Skull," Melky ArgÃ¼elles, Naolico, Veracruz, MÃ©xico.Toya Sarno Jordan for NPRhide caption"COVID Skull," Melky ArgÃ¼elles, Naolico, Veracruz, MÃ©xico.Tell us about the origin of the project and its purpose.Carlos Dávila: We wanted to know how indigenous people understand the virus and the pandemic, and the solutions they find — not medical solutions — but how they live with it and how they picture it.Carlos Dávila, subdirector of bachelor degrees at the National School of Anthropology and History, poses with the mask "The Devil of Teloloapan," by Fidel Puente from Teloloapan, Guerrero, Mexico.Toya Sarno Jordan for NPRhide captionCarlos Dávila, subdirector of bachelor degrees at the National School of Anthropology and History, poses with the mask "The Devil of Teloloapan," by Fidel Puente from Teloloapan, Guerrero, Mexico.How did you recruit these artisans?Blanca Cárdenas: Artists sell their creations in plazas and open-air markets, but because of the pandemic these venues were closed. They had to find another way of selling.Carlos noticed pictures of them offering their masks on Facebook. He contacted them and would commission a work. Then, when it was safe, he would go to their community to pick it up and interview the artist.What's the creative process like?Dávila: The artisans work with different strategies. When we asked one why was he taking so long, he said: "Sorry I haven't been able to dream." This artist had to dream his mask, because that is how he could enter into the supernatural world."Evil Jaguar Mask," Mixteco artisan Yonny Calixto, Ahuehuetitla, Puebla, Mexico.Toya Sarno Jordan for NPRhide caption"Evil Jaguar Mask," Mixteco artisan Yonny Calixto, Ahuehuetitla, Puebla, Mexico.Explain the importance of the supernatural in how the world is understood by these communities.Dávila: In many indigenous cultures, time is perceived differently. It's circular, not linear. Many believe the world gets destroyed every now and then, then regenerates. These masks show the other entities around us—gods, devils, the dead, animals. For us many things are inanimate. But for these cultures, water, mountains, stars and stones have their own spirit. The dead are more alive than we think. Everybody is going to die someday. But a death caused by human consequences, like the virus, is a bad death. They believe that when someone dies of natural causes, they are transformed into a star. When one dies unnaturally they become infected air. Some think the origin of the virus is the continued aggression to our planet and destruction of nature. They say the earth is crying."Cocoliztli," Nahua artisan Juan Hernández González, Atlapexco, Hidalgo, Mexico.Toya Sarno Jordan for NPRhide caption"Cocoliztli," Nahua artisan Juan Hernández González, Atlapexco, Hidalgo, Mexico.Cárdenas: So the pandemic represents a period of destruction, but we can be sure that the world will regenerate with a new order — maybe without humans or with other dramatic changes, but the world will continue.You indicate there is a historical subtext to these masks?Dávila: This year marks the 500th anniversary of the Spanish conquest of Mexico. Pandemics erupted in those indigenous communities with the arrival of Europeans. So the idea of pandemics and sickness coming from the outside is ingrained in their culture."Mestizo Man," Nahua artisan Zeferino Baltasar Basilio, San Francisco OzomatlÃ¡n, Guerrero, Mexico.Toya Sarno Jordan for NPRhide caption"Mestizo Man," Nahua artisan Zeferino Baltasar Basilio, San Francisco OzomatlÃ¡n, Guerrero, Mexico.Let's talk about those masks that reflect that perspective of the infectious "outside world."  One powerful example is a mask of man with pale skin, a mustache, blue eyes and a half dozen coronaviruses attached to his face.Dávila: The blue eyes, mustache and pale skin representmestizoman, an outsider. It's the linking of past and present and the idea that disease is of foreign origin. Many communities were sure the only way to control the virus was to close their borders. There were many months when you couldn't get in."COVID Pig," Nahua artisan Zeferino Baltasar Basilio, San Francisco Ozomatlán, Guerrero, Mexico.Toya Sarno Jordan for NPRhide caption"COVID Pig," Nahua artisan Zeferino Baltasar Basilio, San Francisco Ozomatlán, Guerrero, Mexico.The same artist, Zeferino Baltasar Basilio who createdmestizoman also made a mask representing a black boar covered with viruses. What's the message there?Dávila: That is a COVID pig mask. Pork also suggests illness. If you don't cook it in the correct way, you get sick. Indigenous people associate COVID with eating poorly. They say the sickness arrives because we don't eat well; the remedy is to eat vegetables and greens.Will the masks be used in a ceremonial setting?Cárdenas: Every mask is alive, but to truly become alive, people have to dance with them. Right now, these masks haven't been part of a ritual, but when it's possible, we hope to take the masks to a carnival so they can be used in a ceremonial way.Where did the funding for the project come from?Cárdenas: Unfortunately, the school didn't have any money, so Carlos paid for them.We hope they land in a good place, with a museum or collector — somewhere the objects can be seen so they can communicate their meanings."COVID Bull," Juan Serrano, Zapopan, Jalisco, Mexico.Toya Sarno Jordan for NPRhide captionWhat lessons can be learned from these artful expressions of indigenous cultures?Cárdenas: That there are many ways of living the pandemic and of understanding the virus. Their world is one made of other worlds where humans are not the only species that exist. It teaches us that it is essential to rethink our relationship with the world of nature and to appreciate the importance of the supernatural to these cultures.Cathy Newman is a former editor at large atNational Geographicwhose work has appeared inThe Economist,The Wall Street JournalandScience.Follow her on twitter@wordcat12
   
Will StoneTesting your antibody levels to get a sense of your COVID-19 protection may be tempting, especially as you wait for a booster shot. But scientists say these widely available tests can't tell you the full story, at least not yet.Naveen Sharma/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Gettyhide captionTesting your antibody levels to get a sense of your COVID-19 protection may be tempting, especially as you wait for a booster shot. But scientists say these widely available tests can't tell you the full story, at least not yet.Booster shots against the coronavirus have already started rolling out in the U.S. for some people and millions more could be due for them soon. But as breakthrough infections become more common, many people are wondering in the meantime: Does my immune system have enough firepower to protect me right now?A natural way to look for an answer would seem to be checking for certain antibodies in your blood that target the coronavirus. These are specific proteins made by your immune cells in response to thevaccineor the virus — proteins that serve as a key part of the body's arsenal in preventing COVID-19.Unlike other COVID-19 tests that are used to diagnose an active infection, these antibody tests are aimed at finding evidence of your body's immune response to a past infection with the virus, but they can also pick up certain antibodies that your body generated in response to the vaccine. And while the Food and Drug Administrationdoes not currently recommend antibody tests to assess immunity, that isn't stopping some people."I know a lot of people, even outside of studies, are just getting their antibody levels done," saysDr. Ghady Haidar,a transplant infectious diseases physician at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.There aredozens of tests on the marketthat scan blood samples from a blood draw or a finger prick for the presence of these antibodies. Some tests just let you know if you have them — or not. Others can actually give you scores that reflect your levels. You might think that high enough levels of antibodies mean you don't need that booster, right? Eh, not so fast.While it could be tempting to consider these tests a measuring stick of your immune response — or lack thereof — researchers and doctors say your protection against the virus still can't be boiled down to antibody levels in a simple blood test.On an individual level, antibody tests can be useful for picking up evidence of a past SARS-CoV-2 infection. They're also helpful to researchers studying the prevalence of the virus across a population or tracking the degree to which antibody levels wane over time. And the decline in antibody levels against the coronavirus among some people who got vaccinated late last year were citedas part of the scientific casefor why millions of Americans need booster shots.But scientists in the field say there's still considerable uncertainty aboutwhat these levels of detectable antibodies really meanwhen it comes to protection. And a lack of standardization among the commercially available tests for antibodies makes it even harder to decipher the results."There is no test that will give you that [degree of certainty] at this point," saysGigi Gronvall, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Securitywho has studied serology testing and COVID-19. "There are tests that would show that you've been vaccinated or not, but is that going to be the kind of information you need?"Maybe not, she suggests. Why? Antibody tests only give one view into the body's collection of defenses against the coronavirus. In fact, it's just a subset of antibodies, made in response to the virus or a shot of the vaccine, that neutralize the spike protein on the virus. The spike protein is what enables the coronavirus to break into cells and replicate.There are tests that would show that you've been vaccinated or not, but is that going to be the kind of information you need?Gigi Gronvall of Johns Hopkins"We have a mix of antibodies. Some of them are very good and protective. Some are not as protective," and each person will have their own mix of these different types of antibodies, saysAli Ellebedy, an immunologist at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis who'sstudying the antibody response to the coronavirus.A key unanswered question for researchers like Ellebedy is just how many of these neutralizing antibodies are needed to block the virus?Studies doshowallthreeavailable vaccines in the U.S. — the shots from Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson — can successfully prompt people to produce neutralizing antibodies for the coronavirus variants, including delta. Natural infection with the virus also leads the immune system to produce antibodies that can disarm the virus, though doctorsstill recommendyou get vaccinated even if you've had COVID-19 in the past, because theshots bolster your immune response, including your antibodies. But Ellebedy says that having detectable antibodies from a blood test six months after vaccination "only means that your immune system mounted a successful response then and that you haveimmune memory."While scientists have generated a "ton of data" on which antibodies are best at neutralizing the virus, Ellebedy says, the available antibody tests are not designed to specifically pick up whether you have enough of these protective antibodies, especially in the face of evolving variants.And don't forget the immune system is more than just antibodies, so even with low detectable levels in your blood, you're not defenseless. "Antibody tests — it's really probing just one part of your immune system," saysElitza Theel, who directs the Infectious Diseases Serology Laboratory at the Mayo Clinic.Your immune system really kicks into action if your body encounters the coronavirus. At that point, it generates new antibodies to block the virus and taps another line of defense — called T cells — which clear out the infected cells that have been converted into factories where the virus can multiply.Yes, as long as you don't expect it to give you a straightforward answer for how well-protected you are from catching the virus. The FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Preventionrecommend againstusing antibody tests for this purpose, but it's understandable that Americans are looking to these widely available tests for some indication of their immunity, especially given the growing concerns about declining efficacy of the mRNA vaccines over time. So what sort of legit information could you glean from the results?Dr. Nicole Bouviersays it's reasonable to look at how your results fit into the range of values of a particular test, to get a sense where you fall relative to others who've taken it. Lab companies may also be able to tell you the average level of antibodies of someone who had a coronavirus infection and recovered."That can give you a benchmark for the immune response to natural infection, and then you can sort of gauge your vaccine response against that," says Bouvier, an associate professor of infectious diseases and microbiology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.The tests may give you numerical readings that indicate the level of antibodies in your blood that bind to specific SARS-CoV-2 proteins. "What we're basically learning is that the higher your number is, the more likely you are to be protected," Bouvier says, "and that you don't actually need a super, super high number in order to be protected." But this rule of thumb isbased on large studiesand doesn't necessarily hold true on an individual level.The bottom line is that even doctors who are studying this topic don't know what these antibody readings actually say about your immunity, says Haidar of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, who isrunning a studyon coronavirus antibody response in immunocompromised individuals."We don't know what the optimal antibody level is that correlates with protection," he says.For example, Haidar says it's clear that immunocompromised patients may not have as robust an immune response to the vaccine, and that looking for the presence of antibody levels can hint at their level of protection. But even this can be misleading — because some research suggests that detectable antibodies from those patients still "may not be able to prevent infection as well as antibodies from people who are otherwise healthy."Haidar concedes that if someone has no detectable antibodies on the test, "even though they may have some protection from T cells — and we don't have a full understanding of what this actually means — I can tell you that they are likely not as protected as someone who, let's say, has an antibody level of 1,000."Only complicating the picture for consumers is that thetests on the market are not standardized. They can have varying degrees of sensitivity and look for different antibodies.Some antibody tests sold commercially detect certain antibodies that are only generated in response to the actual virus. Getting a test that looks for these other antibodies (antibodies that target the nucleocapsid protein, for example) could lead someone who is vaccinated to get a negative result and falsely think they are not protected.Despite all these caveats, the idea of a blood test that can eventually give consumers a reliable indication of their immunity is not far-fetched. "We have correlates of protection for other vaccine-preventable diseases like measles and hepatitis," says Theel. "But we're just not there yet with COVID."Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Greg AllenRussell LewisStudents sit in an algebra class at Barbara Coleman Senior High School on the first day of school on Monday in Miami Lakes, Fla. Miami-Dade County public schools require students to wear a mask to prevent the spread of COVID-19.Marta Lavandier/APhide captionStudents sit in an algebra class at Barbara Coleman Senior High School on the first day of school on Monday in Miami Lakes, Fla. Miami-Dade County public schools require students to wear a mask to prevent the spread of COVID-19.A Florida judge has ruled that school districts in the state can require students to wear masks. At least 10 school districts — including some in many of the largest cities — had been defying state rules set by Gov. Ron DeSantis banning mask mandates.Judge John Cooper ruled on a lawsuit brought by parents who say DeSantis overstepped his authority when his administration said school districts couldn't order students to wear masks. DeSantis had warned that "there will be consequences" for districts that defied the ban.Ruling from the bench at the conclusion of a five-day trial, Cooper said that face mask mandates that follow guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are "reasonable and consistent with the best scientific and medical opinion in this country." He found that the DeSantis administration violated the law when it banned school districts from requiring masks.Following an order from the governor, Florida's Health and Education departments issued rules barring school districts from requiring students to wear face masks without allowing their parents to opt out. DeSantis said face mask mandates violate a Florida law that says parents have a right to make educational and health care decisions for their children.Cooper said that in issuing the executive order and rules banning face mask mandates, DeSantis ignored a provision of the law that said school districts are allowed to take actions that are "reasonable and necessary to achieve a compelling state interest."The judge said he would issue an injunction preventing the DeSantis administration from taking any action against school districts with face mask mandates. The state Board of Education has said it plans to withhold funds from the first two school districts that adopted face mask mandates in Alachua and Broward counties.In court this week, lawyers for the parents say DeSantis' order violates a constitutional requirement that districts operate schools that are safe and secure. The state maintains parents have the ultimate authority to decide what's best for their kids. The judge's ruling allows school districts to require masks.Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis takes his mask off as he prepares to speak during a press conference at the Hard Rock Stadium testing site in Miami Gardens, Fla., in May 2020.Joe Raedle/Getty Imageshide captionFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis takes his mask off as he prepares to speak during a press conference at the Hard Rock Stadium testing site in Miami Gardens, Fla., in May 2020.Noting that the coronavirus — and particularly the delta variant — is highly contagious and sometimes fatal to children, Cooper urged people to take a step back, "We will not solve any issue if we can't sit down and work together and take positions recognizing what's going on is not some recent imposition or some attack on the country."The coronavirus and the delta variant have ripped across Florida in recent months (an elementary school in Vero Beachshut down on Fridayuntil after Labor Day). More people have been infected and hospitalized of COVID-19 than at any point during the pandemic. The number of deaths, about 242 a day, is also near a record level.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Sneha DeyMariam Aly, an assistant professor at Columbia University, has tried everything to keep her students from cheating. In her cognitive neuroscience class, she gives her students a week to complete an open-book exam. And, as part of that exam, the nearly 180 students in the class have to sign an honor code.But they're still cheating. And dealing with student misconduct, she says, is the worst part of her job. "It's just awkward and painful for everybody involved," Aly says. "And it's really hard to blame them for it. You do feel disappointed and frustrated."Her students are facing unprecedented levels of stress and uncertainty, she says, and she gets that. "I didn't go to school during a pandemic."As college moved online in the COVID-19 crisis, many universities are reporting increases, sometimes dramatic ones, in academic misconduct. At Virginia Commonwealth University, reports of academic misconduct soared during the 2020-21 school year, to 1,077 — more than three times the previous year's number. At the University of Georgia, cases more than doubled; from 228 in the fall of 2019 to more than 600 last fall. And, at The Ohio State University, reported incidents of cheating were up more than 50% over the year before.But while students may have had new and different opportunities for cutting corners in the online learning environment, it's unclear how much cheating actually increased. Some educators note that there are other factors at play, such as an increased ability to identify misconduct."There was probably increased cheating because there were more temptations and opportunities and stress and pressure. And, faculty were probably detecting it more," says Tricia Bertram Gallant, who researches academic integrity at the University of California, San Diego. "It's easier to catch in the virtual world, in many ways, than it is in the in-person world."When colleges shut down or restricted in-person access, students were taking exams in their bedrooms, with unfettered access to cellphones and other technology. This, educators say, spurred cheating to take on new and different forms.One student at Middle Tennessee State University used his smart speaker to find answers during an exam, according to Michael Baily, the school's director of academic integrity. California State University, Los Angeles, had alarge-scale cheating scandalearly on in the pandemic, after one student alleged that her peers were sharing exam answers through a GroupMe chat.Unauthorized collaboration was a big factor in reports of misconduct at Virginia Commonwealth, says Karen Belanger, the university's director of student conduct and academic integrity. "They were so desperate to connect that they were using — or in some courses being encouraged to create — group chats," she says. "Those chats then became a place where they may talk about homework or talk about exam questions."Students were confused about what was permitted and what wasn't during an exam, Belanger adds. "Sometimes, people just lost track of where the guardrails were in the virtual environment."'Faculty at the University of Georgia gave more open-book exams during the pandemic. Some students then turned to third-party study sites to complete those exams, which is considered a misconduct violation, explains Phillip Griffeth, the school's director of academic honesty."There was a miscommunication. Some students might have saw 'open-book, open-note' as 'open-Internet, open-resources,' " Griffeth explains.Ohio State also saw a large increase in cases where students shared information during the exam or used unauthorized materials, according toan annual reportfrom the school's committee on academic misconduct.Schools, including the University of Georgia and Ohio State, are now trying to educate students on what constitutes an academic misconduct violation."The university is taking several steps to enhance the resources available related to academic integrity so that students continue to be fully aware of expectations and to support instructors in dealing with this issue," an Ohio State spokesman wrote to NPR.Annie Stearns will be a sophomore this fall at St. Mary's College of California, where misconduct reports doubled last fall over the previous year. During the pandemic, the challenges of learning online were entwined with social isolation and additional family responsibilities, she says.On top of that, tutoring services and academic resources scaled back or moved online. Some students, facing Zoom burnout, stopped asking for help altogether."If you're in class, and then you have to go to office hours, that's another Zoom meeting. And if you have to go to the writing center, that's another Zoom meeting," Stearns explains. "People would get too overwhelmed with being on video calls and just opt out."Stearns, who logged onto classes from her family's home last year, faced the pressures of online classes herself, but she sits on her school's academic honor council. For other students, she says, cheating can feel like the only option."We're going through such an unprecedented time that (cheating is) bound to happen," Stearns says. "They prefer to take the shortcut and risk getting caught, than have an email conversation with their professor because they're too ashamed to be like, 'I need assistance.' "Many factors are at play in the rise in reports of cheating and misconduct, and, in interviews with NPR, experts across the higher education spectrum say they aren't at all certain whether, or how much, cheating actually increased."Just because there's an increase in reports of academic misconduct doesn't mean that there's more cheating occurring," says James Orr, a board member of the International Center for Academic Integrity. "In the online environment, I think that faculty across the country are more vigilant in looking for academic misconduct."Data from before the pandemic showedsimilar rates of cheatingwhen comparing online and face-to-face learning environments.And at least one school, the University of Texas at Austin, found that reports of academic misconduct cases actually declined during the pandemic. Katie McGee, the executive director for student conduct and academic integrity there, explains that before the pandemic, UT-Austin had toughened its ability, through software, to detect cheating.With online learning, educators are using third-party tools, which can make cheating easier to detect. Middle Tennessee State, for example, rolled out an online proctoring tool, Examity, at the start of the pandemic. The tool records testing sessions on students' webcams and uses software to flag possible cheating. The university has seen reports of cheating jump by more than 79% from fall of 2019 to spring of 2021."I don't believe that more students started cheating during the pandemic," said Baily. "What I believe is that we then put in place these proctoring systems that enabled us to find these students who were cheating."And Baily says Examity is here to stay at Middle Tennessee State. Orr calls remote, third-party proctoring tools a "new industry standard."That could be a problem for some students and faculty who have raised privacy and equity concerns around such services. At the start of the pandemic, students at Florida State Universitypetitionedthe school to stop using Honorlock. The petition says using Honorlock "blatantly violates privacy rights."And at Miami University, in Ohio, petitionersarguethat yet another service, Proctorio, discriminates against some students, "as it tracks a student's gaze, and flags students who look away from the screen as 'suspicious' too, which negatively impacts people who have ADHD-like symptoms." The petition also goes on to note, "students with black or brown skin have been asked to shine more light on their faces, as the software had difficulty recognizing them or tracking their movements."At the University of Minnesota, students are alsopetitioningagainst the use of Proctorio, calling the service a "huge invasion of privacy."Mike Olsen, the head of Proctorio, wrote in a statement to NPR that humans make all final determinations regarding exam integrity. He added that the company has partnered with third-party data security auditors, and an analysis of Proctorio's latest face-detection models found no measurable bias.Honorlock declined NPR's request for comment.Ken Leopold, a chemistry professor at the University of Minnesota, says he and other faculty must balance privacy concerns with the need to guard against cheating. He says he has avoided using Proctorio in his classes, saying the software "didn't sit right" with him. But then came the pandemic.The school is having conversations with students about remote proctoring. But, he says, "I can't see Proctorio or some equivalent entirely vanishing from the university at this point.""We're sensitive to the students' concerns, but at the same time, we have to uphold academic integrity,'' says Leopold, who advises the university on remote proctoring and academic misconduct. "If you're going to give an exam remotely, you have very little choice."A previous version of this story incorrectly said Tricia Bertram Gallant was affiliated with the University of California, Santa Barbara.

Yuki NoguchiStudents head to class this month in Thornton, Colo. Infectious disease experts say the decline in vaccination rates against childhood diseases during the pandemic has increased the potential for outbreaks of diseases once largely vanquished in the United States.RJ Sangosti/MediaNews Group/The Denver Post via Getty Imageshide captionStudents head to class this month in Thornton, Colo. Infectious disease experts say the decline in vaccination rates against childhood diseases during the pandemic has increased the potential for outbreaks of diseases once largely vanquished in the United States.As she does ahead of every school year, Karen Schwind and the team of school nurses she manages in the New Braunfels Independent School District in central Texas spent a lot of time checking every student's immunization records against the state's database. The nurses also checked with parents and doctors' offices to ensure all students had received their required shots for measles, mumps, diphtheria, meningitis and other childhood diseases before classes started."We start notifying parents in the winter — like January, March and then again in May," says Schwind, whose district has 15 K-12 schools.But recently, just a week before school was set to begin, Schwind estimated about 15% of children in her district were still missing at least one of those shots. COVID-19, she says, has complicated routine childhood vaccinations in a number of ways."Many clinics that give routine vaccines have been converted to giving COVID vaccine," Schwind says. "So in many places, the availability of the routine vaccines may not be the usual spot." Some families moved, or remained in online school all of last year, making it easier to overlookthe state's vaccine requirements. And, Schwind says, in recent years, a growing number of parents have beenapplying for exemptions, citing religious, medical or philosophical reasons.According to the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, similar patterns are playing out across the country, leaving infectious disease experts worried about the potential for outbreaks of illnesses that were once largely vanquished in the United States. Even modest declines in vaccination ratescan compromise immunity within a community, as was seen duringa big measles outbreak in the New York City areain 2018-2019.The foundation's research, released this month, shows the number of doses given ofrecommended childhoodvaccineshas dropped below pre-pandemic levels — down by as much as 6% to 18%, depending on the vaccine or the age group. Babies and young children have been somewhat more likely to stay on schedule with most of their recommended vaccinations during the pandemic, the foundation's data shows, in comparison with adolescents and teens. But every age group is behind.For example, the number of doses ofTdap vaccine— boosters given to kids ages 11 and up to prevent tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis — has dropped 16.7% since 2019. And orders for shots containing measles vaccine are down 18.2%."I've been trying to shout it from the rooftops," to get parents to take their kids in for routine vaccines, saysDr. Sean O'Leary, professor of pediatrics at the University of Colorado School of Medicine and vice chair of the Committee on Infectious Diseases for the American Academy of Pediatrics.Many parents worry about COVID-19 and when they can vaccinate their kids against it, O'Leary notes. But he says, "Frankly, a lot of the diseases that we vaccinate kids for are more severe in children than COVID, and so the last thing we want as we reenter the school year is outbreaks of these other vaccine-preventable diseases."Schwind, the Texas school nurse coordinator, says she and her staff are drawing a hard line in their school district: "We say no shots, no school," she says, meaning the schoolchildren who've missed shots will be flagged and the kids returned to their parents, who must take them to get the shots before they can return to class.But in many schools across the U.S., school nurses don't keep tabs on students' vaccine status, says Linda Mendonca, president of the National Association of School Nurses. Her group's research showsa quarter of schools don't even have a nurse on staff— so it's unclear who's keeping tabs."I don't know who does it, honestly," Mendonca says of those schools. "Maybe the school secretary might keep track of records when they come in to school or something. But do they follow up with it? Do they understand what they're missing?"William Schaffner, a professor of infectious disease at Vanderbilt University, calls the U.S. childhood vaccination programs a big success in public health, but he fears this year could see a big backslide in immunity against diseases such as mumps, meningitis, measles or others that had been under control."We've seen that movie before with measles a couple of years ago," he says, when outbreaks across the country, spanningWashington stateto Texas and New York registered the highest rates of measles cases since the disease had been eradicated in the U.S. in 2000. The disease traveled quickly within pockets of the population where vaccination rates ran low.When vaccination rates fall belowherd immunity levels,diseases such as measles ormumpsorrubella— which are more common outside the U.S. — become a threat that's "only a plane ride away," Schaffner says.Schaffner, who is 84, says such outbreaks were far more common decades ago. For most of his childhood, he says, he remembers polio kept a lid on his social life. Parents lived with thedaily fear of the illness crippling or killing their children. "Couldn't go to swimming pools, couldn't go to movies," he says of his grade-school years through high school. It wasn't until he was in college that a vaccine for polio became available."Children lined up for blocks, were vaccinated and got little buttons like those campaign buttons that said they were a polio pioneer," Schaffner says, and all that helped eradicate the disease in the United States.But Schaffner says that many people today didn't live through that era, so some parents may not feel as much urgency about getting their children those missed shots."There is not the knowledge and therefore not the respect or the fear of these childhood diseases," he says.Schaffner says he hopes it won't take a resurgence of a horrible illness among children to remind people how important it is to keep up with those immunizations.NPR's Pien Huang contributed to this report.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Deepa ShivaramAn emergency room nurse tends to a patient in a hallway last week at the Houston Methodist The Woodlands Hospital in Houston.Brandon Bell/Getty Imageshide captionAn emergency room nurse tends to a patient in a hallway last week at the Houston Methodist The Woodlands Hospital in Houston.More than 100,000 people in the country are hospitalized for the coronavirus, according todatafrom the Department of Health and Human Services. It's thehighest numberof hospitalizations seen since January, before the vaccine was widely available to the public.The data also shows that 30% of intensive care unit beds in hospitals in the country are holding COVID-19 patients.The rapid rise of the virus and its variants comes as only 51.7% of the U.S. population isfully vaccinatedand 61% have received at least one dose of the vaccine.States in the South and Northwest are seeing worse rates than ever before. In Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oregon and Washington, new admissions of COVID-19 patients are at the highest levels since the start of the pandemic.And in both Florida and Georgia, more than 25% of the inpatient hospital beds are being used for COVID-19 patients. In Mississippi, more than 61% of ICU beds have COVID-19 patients.The rapid rise in hospitalizations is causing concern for others who may need emergency services, as wait times in emergency rooms now stretch for several hours in some hospitals.Officials in oneFlorida countyare even urging residents to "consider other options" before calling 911.Throughout the pandemic, the Black and brown communities were hit harder than white people. The more recent surge of hospitalizations is having the same impact."Hospitalization rates for non-Hispanic Black people increased faster and has risen higher than other groups," theCenters for Disease Control and Preventionsays.In the last week of July, the hospitalization rate for non-Hispanic Black people was the highest of any other racial group. Out of every 100,000 people 11.5 were hospitalized with COVID-19. For non-Hispanic white people, the rate is 4.2 out of every 100,000, a far lower number.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Sydney LupkinThen-Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar (left) and President Donald Trump listen as Moncef Slaoui of Operation Warp Speed speaks about the crash program to develop a COVID-19 vaccine in the White House Rose Garden in May 2020.Drew Angerer/Getty Imageshide captionThen-Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar (left) and President Donald Trump listen as Moncef Slaoui of Operation Warp Speed speaks about the crash program to develop a COVID-19 vaccine in the White House Rose Garden in May 2020.It was 17 days before Pfizer's first delivery deadline under its federal COVID-19 vaccine contract, and the company wasn't going to meet it, according to federal records and several people familiar with the matter.Officials with Operation Warp Speed, the Trump administration's multibillion-dollar push to make a COVID-19 vaccine available in record time, didn't know there was a problem.Early on the morning of Nov. 10, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar was on theTodayshowtalking to Savannah Guthrie about the "fruits of Operation Warp Speed and America's biopharmaceutical industry.""Pfizer will be producing and delivering to us approximately 20 million doses of vaccine each month starting at the end of this month, in November," Azar told Guthrie.But Pfizer was more than a month behind that schedule. It wouldn't finish delivering the doses projected to be due in its contract on Nov. 27 until mid-January, according to an NPR analysis of allocation data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and interviews with several people familiar with the matter.A day earlier, Pfizer changed a line that had been appearing at the bottom of many of its news releases since the summer. Instead of saying it would make 100 million doses for the world by the end of the year,the company disclosedthat it would make 50 million.Still, Azar had no idea what he was saying was wrong, Paul Mango, Azar's deputy chief of staff, told NPR."I can assure you that Alex Azar always conveyed the truth as he knew it," said Mango, who stepped down in January, of Azar'sTodaycomments. "It's just that the truth was being concealed from us."Pfizer disputes this. "There was not only full transparency, there was show and tell," Pfizer spokesperson Sharon Castillo told NPR.Meanwhile, cases were climbing. That week, the CDC counted more than 10,000 deaths for the first time since COVID-19 hit.Operation Warp Speed was depending on Pfizer to deliver more than two-thirds of the vaccines expected in late 2020. But the company's initial contract, worth nearly $2 billion, contained limited reporting requirements to the federal government when there was a delay. As a result, the government didn't know how many doses were really coming, and Pfizer's estimates kept dropping, according to several people familiar with the matter.Every delay in vaccine production meant that the U.S. was slower to contain the pandemic.When then-President Donald Trump announced his administration's COVID-19 vaccine initiative in the Rose Garden on May 15, 2020, he said: "It's called Operation Warp Speed. That means big, and it means fast."He was right. Vaccine development usually takes years. But by spending billions of dollars right away, the Trump administration was trying to condense that timeline to less than a year. A big chunk of the money was earmarked to help companies gear up their manufacturing so they could begin making vaccines even before they knew for sure if they worked.Moncef Slaoui, the former GlaxoSmithKline executive who had been tapped to be the scientific lead of Operation Warp Speed, paused to address Trump directly during the press conference."In fact, Mr. President, I have very recently seen early data from a clinical trial with a coronavirus vaccine. And this data made me feel even more confident that we will be able to deliver a few hundred million doses of vaccine by the end of 2020."But the reality, said pharmaceutical manufacturing consultant John Avellanet, is that there was no way these companies could ever have delivered that many doses before the end of the year. "That was a fantasy," he said.Methodology:To calculate the number of doses Pfizer released and delivered to the U.S. government in December and January, NPR relied on allocation data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This database breaks down first and second doses allocated to jurisdictions each week.For context, doses can't be allocated unless they've been "released" to the federal government, meaning the pharmaceutical company tells officials how many doses have been set aside for the U.S. in a given week. The government then decides how many doses can go where. At that point, jurisdictions can order them for delivery.In December, officials were holding back second doses to be sure they would be available for people who had received their first shot. The result was that for the last three weeks of 2020, only first doses were delivered to jurisdictions. Pfizer released 15.4 million doses and delivered 7.7 million doses in December.Gen. Gustave Perna, Operation Warp Speed's chief operating officer, also told reporters in early December he was holding back 500,000 doses in reserve. However, by January, the government stopped holding second doses back. As such, a tally of first and second doses allocated 21 days earlier became a more accurate count of how many doses Pfizer released and delivered to the United States by any given week.Using this formula, NPR has determined that Pfizer released and delivered 16.9 million doses in all by the week of Jan. 11 and 21.7 million doses by the week of Jan. 18. The federal government has not yet provided documents or data to NPR for full release data in response to our public records request.Avellanet wasn't involved in Operation Warp Speed, but he has decades of experience consulting for pharmaceutical manufacturers. He said anyone from the industry probably knew — and likely cautioned —  Operation Warp Speed that they were making a "big, ginormous assumption of everything going right."Manufacturers can expect to face unforeseen hurdles when they begin to mass-produce a brand new vaccine. And in a pandemic, there are bound to be supply chain problems as well.Slaoui acknowledges that the manufacturing was expected to be difficult: "The absence of issues is the miracle. The presence of issues is really what would happen normally."He told NPR he was optimistic in his Rose Garden statement because of an email he'd seen earlier that morning — his last as a Moderna board member. It made him feel confident enough in the science to believe there would be a vaccine before the end of the year. As to why he said he expected "a few hundred million" vaccine doses by then, he said he was repeating the goal of the project, which was to have enough doses for all Americans.Overall, Slaoui said having tens of millions of doses of a 95% effective vaccine within a year of the virus' genetic code being sequenced is an "unbelievable" accomplishment. Slaoui said Operation Warp Speed was able to complete tasks in six months that normally take seven years.Although Slaoui said he wished Pfizer had been more transparent in its communications with the government, he said the supply delays that arose in late 2020 weren't the result of a lackluster effort on the company's part. "It's more because that's life in manufacturing of vaccines," he told NPR. "We had to have aggressive timelines to try and meet them while knowing we may not meet them."The actual contracts contained much more modest initial delivery goals, according to a review of federal contracts by the Government Accountability Office. By the end of the year, Pfizer and Moderna were expected to deliver 55 million doses of their vaccines in all, according to the review.After the Rose Garden announcement, Slaoui and others began evaluating which vaccine candidates to fund. They'd started with about 100, the administration said, though the full list was never made public. The team quickly whittled the list down to 14 and then whittled it down again to eight."Absolutely from Day 1, Pfizer was very clear," Slaoui said. "They don't want any money upfront. They want to take all the financial risk, but they want to have the assurance that there would be a marketplace if the vaccine is efficacious."The announcements started to roll in: $1.2 billion for AstraZeneca, $1.6 billion for Novavax, another $472 million for Moderna on top of the $483 million the administration already gave the company in April. (Some research and development funding was awarded before Operation Warp Speed was announced, but those awards were wrapped into the project.)Financial support to jump-start manufacturing wasn't itemized and was instead lumped together with funding for research and bulk purchases, so it's not readily apparent exactly how much went toward manufacturing alone.The bet on manufacturing was big and risky, but one that promised public health dividends. The idea was that by the time the Food and Drug Administration gave the COVID-19 vaccines a green light, there would be plenty of doses ready and waiting."Usually you have ramping up of production right after the vaccine is approved or licensed," saidDr. Saad Omer, who directs the Yale Institute for Global Health. "At-risk manufacturing pulls forward the timeline for vaccinating the masses."Officials knew early on that Pfizer wouldn't accept federal funding for research and development, but the company was making moves to be part of Operation Warp Speed in its own way. Sometime that summer, it joined a group of academics and companies called theMedical CBRN Defense Consortium,according to an August 2020 noticein theFederal Register. The consortium is run by a defense contract management firm calledAdvanced Technology International Inc.Instead of entering into contracts directly with vaccine makers, more than $6 billion in Operation Warp Speed funding would be routed throughAdvanced Technology International, which then awarded contracts to companies working on COVID-19 vaccines. Thecontracts could be more tailored to the company's wants and needs and include fewer standard taxpayer protectionsbecause Advanced Technology International specializes in nontraditional government contracts.But Operation Warp Speed needed to be sure all the vaccine studies had similar designs so they could be compared with one another, Slaoui said."The hardest one was with Pfizer because they were saying, 'I'm not getting any money from you. So I don't have to agree.' The answer was, 'Yes, we understand. However, if you want to get the commit[ment] to buy the vaccine, we have to be able to compare it to the Moderna vaccine, to the J&J vaccine, to the Oxford vaccine.'"Although no contract had been announced for Pfizer, the company's chief business officer, John Young, testified alongside other pharmaceutical executives at a congressional hearing on July 21, 2020,about COVID-19 vaccines in development.U.S. Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill., used her turn to grill the executives about their commitment to keeping vaccine prices affordable, given the significant taxpayer investment in Operation Warp Speed.When she got to Young, she noted that Pfizer rejected taxpayer funding. She told him she worried that Pfizer did this to "price gouge" without having to answer to Congress.Young said that wasn't the case. "We didn't accept the federal government funding solely for the reason that we wanted to be able to move as quickly as possible with our vaccine candidate into the clinic," he said. "In regard to your question, let me just say that we recognize that these are extraordinary times, and our pricing will reflect that."The next day, HHS announced it had reached a deal with Pfizer to purchase 100 million doses for $1.95 billion, or $19.50 a dose, if and only if the vaccine won FDA authorization. The government didn't help fund Pfizer's research as it did the other manufacturers in Operation Warp Speed.The government later agreed to pay about $15 per dose for the first 100 million doses of Moderna's vaccine, excluding money that went toward research and development.Over the course of the summer and fall, as clinical trials progressed, Operation Warp Speed assisted 23 factories that would be making the vaccines.For five of the six companies deemed part of Operation Warp Speed, the government was helping secure raw materials, equipment and more. Experts from Operation Warp Speed were also hands-on in helping the factories hire and train workers and develop quality systems.Pfizer was the exception.The build-out was bumpy at times, but Operation Warp Speed adapted."When you have all of that motion, things happen," Mango told NPR. "Equipment arrives, and it doesn't work. Like pipes are connected in the wrong direction. Plants, you know, all that stuff just ... is a function of a massive scale-up that in many cases was the first time done in history. So it was a very steep learning curve."AGovernment Accountability Office reportreleased in April identified multiple chokepoints in the manufacturing process, including limited production capacity of an unidentified "raw material." A domestic factory making it had a fire that delayed delivery between four and 10 weeks. A foreign facility making it had an explosion, prompting its manufacturing to shift to another facility entirely.The government had limited visibility into what was happening at Pfizer, according to several people familiar with the matter, thanks to the unique contract it negotiated with the federal government.Banks of ultracold freezers are used to store COVID-19 vaccines at Pfizer's Kalamazoo manufacturing complex in Portage, Mich.Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Imageshide captionBanks of ultracold freezers are used to store COVID-19 vaccines at Pfizer's Kalamazoo manufacturing complex in Portage, Mich.Slaoui said Pfizer worked "at arm's length" compared with the other companies in Operation Warp Speed.As a result, government officials weren't in its facilities every day dealing with the growing pains of making millions of doses of messenger RNA vaccine, a new type that had never before been commercially produced.Castillo, Pfizer's spokesperson, said Operation Warp Speed officials visited Pfizer's Kalamazoo, Mich., vaccine factory three times: in July, November and December.In the late summer of 2020, with large-scale clinical trials underway and officials' focus shifting toward distribution once the vaccine got the FDA's blessing, Pfizer told the federal government it was doing better than expected. Instead of the 40 million doses projected in its contract by year's end, it would have 50 million.For months, everything seemed to be going according to plan.According toan Aug. 27, 2020, emailto Nevada state health officials obtained byAmerican Oversight, the CDC expected 2 million doses of Pfizer's vaccine (designated "vaccine A") to be available in October, with another 10 million to 20 million available in November and 20 million to 30 million available in December.By the time thefirst version of the CDC's "interim playbook"for COVID-19 vaccinations was made public on Sept. 16, those numbers hadn't changed. But a second version,published Oct. 29, left out the possibility of any October doses.Officials on the state and local level grew frustrated with the Trump administration. The number of doses expected in 2020 kept changing, sometimes depending on who was giving the information. Many officials asked for detailed numbers in writing but never got them."During the fall, during those meetings, the anticipated number of doses was going up and down," said Claire Hannan, executive director of the Association of Immunization Managers. "I mean, I don't think we ever actually had anything more than just estimates. And there really just wasn't a good sense of how much vaccine would be available and when."Anytime a federal official said a new number during a press event, immunization managers would whip out their calculators to figure out how much they might get."It's very difficult to plan a rollout or plan clinics or plan, you know, which providers are going to get doses if you don't know how many you're going to get," Hannan said. "So, you know, that was very challenging."And then, a week or so after Azar's optimisticTodayshow appearance on Nov. 10, Pfizer told the government it wouldn't be able to meet the 40 million dose goal for the end of the year laid out in its contract, but it wasn't yet clear how far behind the company was, according to several people familiar with the matter.Pfizer spokesperson Castillo said the company was in "constant communication" with Operation Warp Speed, adding that government officials knew that fewer doses were coming and why."There were several factors which impacted the number of doses estimated to be available in 2020," she said. "For one, scaling up a vaccine at this pace was unprecedented, and the scale-up of the raw material supply chain took longer than expected. In addition, the outcome of the clinical trial was somewhat later than the initial projection, requiring us to focus additional efforts on clinical trial production."Although the company didn't deliver 40 million doses, she said that "it was always understood" the numbers in its contract and projections could change."The notion of flexibility was laced throughout the July 2020 agreement," she said. "For example, the due date column in the deliverables table was labeled 'Estimated Due Date.' "Although all the Operation Warp Speed agreements with vaccine makers were a little different, Pfizer's stands out. As part of its eventual federal deal, Pfizer got a tailor-made contract awarded through Advanced Technology International.In exchange for doing its research and development without government help, Pfizer got a contract that let it retain almost all of its intellectual property rights and forgo the taxpayer protection clauses found in most government contracts that fund inventions.There were incremental targets inPfizer's original Operation Warp Speed contractto deliver 20 million doses a month starting in November and ending in March to hit 100 million eventually in all. But the contract said those requirements were "subject to change" based on a variety of factors outside the company's control."They're not hard and fast deadlines," said Kathryn Ardizzone, a lawyer at Knowledge Ecology International who reviewed the vaccine contracts. Knowledge Ecology International is a nonprofit public interest group focused on intellectual property.The contract doesn't specifically give the government the right to verify Pfizer's reasons for not meeting a delivery milestone. That's apparent in the way the contract lays out how vaccines beyond the original 100 million doses would be purchased, Ardizzone said. It just said Pfizer "shall inform the government" how many additional vaccine doses it can make and on what timetable."So that seems like Pfizer is in the driver's seat in terms of what the deadlines will be," Ardizzone said. "The language of that just speaks to Pfizer telling the government about when it can accomplish certain goals, rather than the government having the right to verify that."Overall, the government had no leverage to enforce Pfizer's November deadline once it learned those doses weren't going to be ready, Operation Warp Speed's Mango said."What are we going to do, refuse to take doses at any time from the only manufacturer under an EUA [emergency use authorization]? That didn't make sense," Mango said. "So at the time, remember, Moderna didn't get its EUA until Dec. 21, and there was no guarantee on that either. So we had a very difficult, rocky relationship with Pfizer."Some of that friction arose because Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said as early as August that the company would have top-line vaccine efficacy data by the end of October but didn't announce it until days after the 2020 election. And Pfizer told the Biden team the good news before telling Operation Warp Speed officials, who were then still in office.Mango said that Trump's team had secured the needles, syringes and dry ice — not to mention a $2 billion federal contract with Pfizer — yet it felt like the last to know about the strong vaccine efficacy data: "How could we be happy with that?"By the first week of December, Pfizer told Operation Warp Speed it would have just 22 million doses ready for distribution by the end of the year, several people familiar with the matter told NPR. Before the end of the month, that number dropped again — to 18 million doses.Castillo, Pfizer's spokesperson, said the company let Operation Warp Speed know earlier that fall that a lower number of doses would be arriving by the end of the year. In November, Operation Warp Speed made planning numbers available to jurisdictions based on an assumed 22.5 million Pfizer doses by the end of the year, she said.However, not everyone seems to have been briefed at the same time. Some people NPR spoke with said they knew there would be around 22 million doses in November. Others said Pfizer didn't tell them until December.Slaoui said he remembers it being "quite late."Boxes containing Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine were prepared for shipment at the company's Kalamazoo, Mich., plant in December.Morry Gash/AFP via Getty Imageshide captionBoxes containing Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine were prepared for shipment at the company's Kalamazoo, Mich., plant in December."We did not have all the information," he said. "And usually I would have a conversation with Albert Bourla, where he would just assure me that everything humanly possible is being done to meet the deadlines."Slaoui said he believed him, but he didn't know the specifics at the time.Ultimately, Pfizer released 16 million doses by year-end, according to CDC allocation data.The shortfall was a sobering setback for the architects of Operation Warp Speed."They wouldn't tell us what went wrong," Mango said. "We have no idea. All we know is they didn't deliver the goods, and their estimates of what they were going to deliver diminished significantly from the late summer until the end of December."For Pfizer's part, spokesperson Castillo said any characterizations that it was behind and failing to be transparent about it are politically motivated "in an effort to harm Pfizer and its COVID-19 vaccine.""They are not an accurate representation of the overall nature of Pfizer's relationship with the USG [U.S. government] and the vast majority of the government officials who were OWS [Operation Warp Speed] members," she said.She said the company shared everything with the government, updating it as information became available. The federal government was also part of key Pfizer decisions.The people involved in Operation Warp Speed kept politics out of it, Slaoui said."I worked every day with the commitment that if things became politically influenced, I would leave the operation," he said. "And frankly, I think if it was politically influenced, it would not have worked."He added, "When we were frustrated with Pfizer, it was more complicated to plan not knowing than knowing. It's just a fact."Meanwhile, contract negotiations were underway for the United States to purchase its next 100 million doses of Pfizer's vaccine, and they were about to get messy.On Dec. 8, three days before the FDA authorized Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine, ex-FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, a member of Pfizer's board of directors, saidon CNBCthat the U.S. government had waited too long to buy more COVID-19 doses — and it might not get any in the second quarter of the year as a result."Pfizer did offer an additional allotment coming out of that plan — basically the second quarter allotment — multiple times," Gottlieb said. When the U.S. hesitated to take the company up on these offers, it entered agreements with other countries, he said. As a result, it wasn't clear how many would be left for the United States.Azar replied that evening onPBS NewsHour."They refused to commit to any other production or delivery by a time certain," he said of the negotiations for more doses with Pfizer. "I'm certainly not going to sign a deal with Pfizer, giving them $10 billion to buy vaccine that they could deliver to us five, 10 years hence. That doesn't make any sense."What Azar didn't say was that Pfizer was already missing milestones in its original contract.The second contract wasn't yet resolved when the FDA issued an emergency use authorization for Pfizer's vaccine on Dec. 11.After that, as Pfizer released doses each week, the government would allocate them to states, making sure there were enough for second doses 21 days later. Then, states would order them, and first doses would be shipped out.For the week of Dec. 14, the government allocated nearly 3 million first doses, but when it allocated doses for the next week, there was a problem. The estimates initially provided to states via Operation Warp Speed's data system were much higher than the number of doses that were ultimately allocated.On Dec. 14, Sandra Lindsay, an intensive care nurse at Long Island Jewish Medical Center in the Queens borough of New York City, became the first person in the U.S. to receive the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine after the Food and Drug Administration  authorized it for emergency use.Mark Lennihan/Pool/Getty Imageshide captionOn Dec. 14, Sandra Lindsay, an intensive care nurse at Long Island Jewish Medical Center in the Queens borough of New York City, became the first person in the U.S. to receive the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine after the Food and Drug Administration  authorized it for emergency use.Some states learned that their weekly dose deliveries would be cut nearly in half from the original estimates they received, but they said the federal government didn't tell them why. State immunization employees scrambled for informationand had to decide which sites would get fewer doses than they'd planned based on the bad estimates.Governors took to social media and news conferences to vent their outrage."This is disruptive and frustrating,"Washington Gov. Jay Inslee tweetedon Dec. 17. "We need accurate, predictable numbers to plan and ensure on-the-ground success."Pfizer issued a statementthat same day, saying it had "millions more doses sitting in our warehouse" but was just waiting for instructions from the U.S. to ship them."It was frustrating to see the level of scrutiny on the number of doses, when the miracle was that we have a vaccine," Slaoui said.A few days later, a top official with Operation Warp Speed weighed in."I want to take personal responsibility for the miscommunication," Gen. Gustave Perna, Operation Warp Speed's chief operating officer, saidduring a Dec. 19 press briefing. "I know that's not done much these days, but I am responsible. And I take responsibility for the miscommunication."Perna said at the press briefing that jurisdictions asked for planning numbers, and he provided them to the best of his ability, "but vaccine manufacturing is a very arduous technical capability."There was a disconnect between the forecasted doses available and the number of doses actually releasable to states after quality checks, he said."At the end of the day, the number of doses available to us to allocate ended up being lower," he said, adding a personal apology to the governors. "Because this is a herculean effort and we are not perfect, the key is to be transparent and to openly communicate at all levels, step by step. To that end, we are in constant dialogue with both industry partners to assure doses are available."According to several people familiar with the matter, Perna's apology amounted to taking one for the Operation Warp Speed team.Even as Pfizer trimmed its projections, Operation Warp Speed was "trying to be incredibly collaborative, maybe to a fault," said a person familiar with Operation Warp Speed, who declined to be identified further, adding that the federal Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority in particular didn't want to throw pharmaceutical companies under the bus for failing to meet initial vaccine supply expectations.Gen.

Gustave Perna speaks at a Senate committee hearing in February. Perna took personal responsibility for miscommunication about the supply of COVID-19 vaccine doses at a press briefing on Dec. 19."Gen. Perna apologized and we supported him, and it was not at all because the distribution did anything wrong," Slaoui said. He explained that providing a precise number of doses from week to week is incredibly difficult, given the hurdles of early manufacturing.Perna's apology seemed to help defuse some of the tension. Pfizer and the government came to an agreement for another 100 million doses for $2.05 billion on Dec. 22.And this time, the U.S. governmentwould use the Defense Production Act to get Pfizer some supplies it needed. Until then, the other five Operation Warp Speed vaccines had at least some help from the federal government under the Defense Production Act, which allowed the vaccine makers to be at the front of the line when they needed certain supplies, equipment, ingredients or more from third-party vendors. Now Pfizer would have that advantage, too.By the end of the month, Pfizer delivered 16 million vaccine doses to the United States. It was 2 million short of its latest lowered projection and 24 million short of its contractual targets.By late February, Pfizer got its vaccine manufacturing humming and — with Moderna — delivered vaccine doses in high volumes to help bring case counts down. Because it takes so long to make each batch, many of those doses were in production even before Trump and Operation Warp Speed officials left.But before vaccines could bend the pandemic's curve downward, another 243,000 people would die from COVID-19 from December through February, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.It was in February that vaccines finally started to have an impact, particularly on nursing home populations, saidDr. William Moss, executive director of the International Vaccine Access Center at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health."I think if we had more doses earlier, we may have been able to have an impact on the mortality rates, I think, in the nursing home population in particular," he said. "But it is more than just having doses."It's possible that even if the United States had all 55 million vaccine doses expected under the contracts by the end of the year, it wouldn't have had the infrastructure in place to distribute them and get them into people's arms.Johnson & Johnson, the third COVID-19 vaccine supplier in the U.S., only got the FDA's authorization in late February, and the company has struggled to supply it in volume because of manufacturing issues.Pfizer said it released all of the 300 million doses it had committed to the U.S. by the middle of July. The company has invested in its global supply chain to make this happen, including doubling its batch sizes, producing its own lipids (the fatty substance that coats the mRNA used in the vaccine) and dry ice and reducing the manufacturing timeline from 110 days to 60 days, spokesperson Castillo said.In late July, Pfizer agreed to supply the government with an additional 200 million vaccine doses for delivery between October 2021 and April 2022, which would support the government's plan to provide booster shots.As of Aug. 25, 73%of adults have had at least one doseof the Pfizer, Moderna or the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, according to data from the CDC. And Pfizer is the dominant supplier, accounting for about 57% of the doses administered overall."I think it's a good news, bad news story," Yale's Omer said. "The good news is that we eventually got to a pretty substantial number of doses by spring, etc. But I did think that some of their [Operation Warp Speed's] pronouncements ... there seems to be a lack of overlap between what the government officials were assuming versus what was happening."Slaoui said he doesn't want to minimize the fact that Operation Warp Speed could have immunized millions of people a few weeks earlier had Pfizer met its goals on time, but overall, his team — and Pfizer's — did what they set out to do."There was always in the mind of everybody in the operation that the big picture is to have vaccines," Slaoui said. "The very small picture was whether it was 1.5 million this week or 1.8 million."You can contact NPR pharmaceuticals correspondent Sydney Lupkin atslupkin@npr.org.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
The Associated PressPeople sit under Delta sign at Salt Lake City International Airport on July 1, 2021. Delta Air Lines won't force employees to get vaccinated, but it's going to make unvaccinated workers pay a $200 monthly charge.Rick Bowmer/APhide captionPeople sit under Delta sign at Salt Lake City International Airport on July 1, 2021. Delta Air Lines won't force employees to get vaccinated, but it's going to make unvaccinated workers pay a $200 monthly charge.Delta Air Lines will charge employees on the company health plan $200 a month if they fail to get vaccinated against COVID-19, a policy the airline's top executive says is necessary because the average hospital stay for the virus costs the airline $40,000.CEO Ed Bastian said that all employees who have been hospitalized for the virus in recent weeks were not fully vaccinated.The airline said Wednesday that it also will stop extending pay protection to unvaccinated workers who contract COVID-19 on Sept. 30, and will require unvaccinated workers to be tested weekly beginning Sept. 12, although Delta will cover the cost. They will have to wear masks in all indoor company settings.Delta stopped short of matching United Airlines, which will require employees to be vaccinated starting Sept. 27 or face termination. However, the $200 monthly surcharge, which starts in November, may have the same effect."This surcharge will be necessary to address the financial risk the decision to not vaccinate is creating for our company," Bastian said in a memo to employees.Bastian said that 75% of Delta employees are vaccinated, up from 72% in mid-July. He said the aggressiveness of the leading strain of the virus "means we need to get many more of our people vaccinated, and as close to 100% as possible."The Delta CEO referred to the COVID-19 mutation that originated in India by by its medical name, B.1.617.2, rather than the more common term, the delta variant.New reported cases of COVID-19 in the U.S. now top 150,000 a day, the highest level since late January, although the rate of increase has slowed. Southwest, Spirit and Frontier have blamed the virus for a slowdown in customers booking flights, and U.S. air travel remains down more than 20% from pre-pandemic 2019.Delta and United already require new hires to be vaccinated. Other major U.S. airlines, including American and Southwest, say they are encouraging employees to get vaccinated but have not required it.Delta's requirement for weekly testing of unvaccinated employees will start Sept. 12, and the requirement that the unvaccinated wear masks indoors takes effect immediately.A growing number of companies including Chevron Corp. and drugstore chain CVS announced they will require workers to get vaccinated after this week's decision by the Food and Drug Administration to give full approval instead of just emergency-use permission to the Pfizer vaccine.The FDA's move could boost the U.S. vaccination rate, which fell from 3.4 million shots a day in April to about 500,000 a day in July. It has since climbed to about 850,000 a day as concern grows about a rising number of new infections caused by the delta variant.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Vanessa RomoA Los Angeles City Fire Department captain who railed against the city, the department and his own union leaders over an imminent vaccine mandate for all city workers is under an internal investigation."I am so hopping mad right now, you have no idea. My head could pop," Capt. Cristian Granucci told viewers as he launched into a 12-minute video rant on Monday in which he threatened to sue the localfirefightersunion and the city.Granucci, who says he's a 31-year veteran, gnashed his teeth as he called the COVID-19 vaccine mandate "total tyranny" and insisted that he is "done being silent on this matter, and so are many of our members."Los Angeles City Fire Department Capt. Cristian Granucci threatens to sue the city and United Firefighters of Los Angeles City Local 112 for not stopping the vaccine mandate that is set to take effect in October.The city's recently passed rule is awaiting signature by LA Mayor Eric Garcetti and won't go into effect until early October. At that point, all city employees will have to show they've received the COVID-19 vaccine or submit to twice-weekly testing. Refusing both of those requirements would lead to termination.Wearing an LAFD hat and LA City Fire Department T-shirt, in what appears to be a fire station, Granucci acknowledged he will likely "catch total grief" for stating his opinions then proceeded to accuse union officials of sitting on their hands as the "mandate came to Los Angeles."  He also complained that union leaders abandoned their responsibilities "to protect the little guy," opting instead "to play politics with this."The purpose of the video, he said, was to offer a warning of the act-now-or-else variety."I am putting my administration and my union on blast," Granucci said, pointing a finger into the camera."There is a large group of us, in the hundreds, and we have an attorney on retainer and he is a shark."As of Tuesday, it appears the original video has been taken down, but a reposted version of Granucci's monologue has been seen more than 64,000 times.LAFD spokeswoman Cheryl Getuiza confirmed that the department became aware of the video on Monday. It has since launched an internal personnel investigation into the captain, and she said he may face disciplinary action."While we respect the individual's right to his opinion, he is not authorized to speak on behalf of the Department," Getuiza said by email. "The individual is in uniform and appears to be on duty, thereby giving the impression that he is speaking in an official capacity."Getuiza said that there is no timeline set for the investigation but that it will include interviews and consultation with the City Attorney's office.President of the firefighters Local 112 union, Freddy Escobar said the issue over mandatory vaccinations has sparked "passionate discussion" within the city's fire stations. And, while officials encourage members to get the shots, "we do not support any City policies that make it a condition of employment," he said."The majority of our firefighters have voluntarily been vaccinated and more are choosing to do so each week," Escobar said in an emailed statement.The latest LAFD data show that 54.26% of sworn members are fully vaccinated and that 61.6% have received at least their first dose.Since the rollout of the vaccines, the department has played an integral role in the city's inoculation campaign, including at events where firefighters deliver the jabs. It is unclear whether those administering the shots are required to be vaccinated.Escobar noted another problem currently facing the department: understaffing and retention, which would be exacerbated if nearly half of the LAFD were to be fired for failing to comply with the vaccine mandate."We are in discussions with the City because our highly skilled and experienced LAFD Firefighters and Paramedics cannot be easily replaced — especially in a department that is already understaffed," he said. "The unexpected departure of even a small percentage of our workforce would have a devastating impact on public safety in Los Angeles."Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
The Associated PressDisney World has an agreement with its unions that members must get COVID-19 vaccinations by Oct. 22. They can apply for medical and religious exemptions.Joe Burbank/Orlando Sentinel via APhide captionDisney World has an agreement with its unions that members must get COVID-19 vaccinations by Oct. 22. They can apply for medical and religious exemptions.FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. — Florida's Walt Disney World will now require union employees as well as non-union and salaried workers to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 to keep their jobs at the theme park. The company also said Wednesday it would soon require vaccines for its cruise passengers ages 12 and up on ships to the Bahamas.The deal was reached Monday with a union coalition, shortly after the Pfizer vaccine earned full Food and Drug Administration approval. It requires the workers to show proof of vaccination by Oct. 22 to remain employed, although employees can request exemptions for medical or religious reasons, a union statement said.Any employee who doesn't comply, and doesn't request an exemption, will be "separated from the company with a 'yes' rehire status," according to the Service Trades Council Union. Before layoffs and furloughs due to the pandemic, the coalition covered about 43,000 of 77,000 Disney World workers.Disney announced last month that all non-union hourly and salaried employees would be required to receive the vaccine within 60 days. The company also asked all employees who were working from home to show proof of vaccination before returning to work.The company will hold on-site vaccine events for employees over the next several weeks, the union statement said.On the cruise side, Disney will require all passengers ages 12 and older to be fully vaccinated on trips to the Bahamas. The decision comes days after that country announced it would not allow ships to enter its ports, including private islands owned by various cruise lines unless eligible passengers are fully vaccinated. The order runs from Sept. 3 through Nov. 1.Earlier this month, 26 crew members and one passenger tested positive for COVID-19 on a Carnival cruise just before the ship made a stop in Belize City.According to a statement from Disney, unvaccinated children must provide proof of a negative COVID-19 PCR test taken between 5 days and 24 hours prior to the cruise and will also be given a second test at the terminal before boarding."We are resuming sailing in a gradual, phased approach that emphasizes multiple layers of health and safety measure," the statement said.Other cruise lines including Royal Caribbean have updated their policies with similar mandates. Carnival said that only children under 12 and adults with a medical condition that prohibits vaccination are exempt from the requirements starting Aug. 28 through October, for departures from all Atlantic and Gulf homeports.Norwegian Cruise Line already had a vaccinated-only passenger policy in place.The mandates conflict with orders of Florida's Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, who forbid cruise lines from requiring vaccines for passengers. The issue is being decided in the courts where the latest ruling by a federal appeals court overturned pandemic restrictions on Florida-based cruise ships.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is fighting the DeSantis-led lawsuit challenging the regulations, arguing the rules would prevent future COVID-19 outbreaks on ships that are vulnerable to the spread of the virus because of their close quarters and frequent stops at foreign ports.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
The Associated PressWILKES-BARRE, Pa. — A Pennsylvania woman who pleaded guilty to coughing and spitting on food at a supermarket in the early days of the coronavirus pandemic was sentenced Tuesday to at least a year in jail.Margaret Ann Cirko, 37, pleaded guilty in June to a felony count of making bomb threats.Authorities said Cirko entered a Gerrity's Supermarket location in Hanover Township, near Wilkes-Barre, on March 25, 2020, and purposely coughed on fresh produce and other merchandise while yelling that she had the virus and that everyone would get sick.Joe Fasula, co-owner of the supermarket chain, said that over $35,000 worth of merchandise had to be thrown out as a result of what Gerrity's had called a "twisted prank."Cirko tested negative for COVID-19, according to her attorney, who said she was intoxicated at the time of the incident.Cirko apologized in court Tuesday."I wish I could take it back," she said.A Luzerne County judge called Cirko's conduct "totally outrageous" and sentenced her to one to two years in jail, to be followed by eight years of probation. She also was ordered to pay nearly $30,000 in restitution.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Will StoneA year and a half into the pandemic, doctors are getting better at recognizing long COVID — the collection of persistent health problems that some people develop after a coronavirus infection — but research has yet to pinpoint what could be driving the illness."Most likely it's more than just one condition," said Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, which ispouring $470 millioninto a national study on long COVID. "The really troubling aspects of this terrible pandemic might be the lingering of this long-tail effect on people."Long COVID is a kind of shape-shifting illness that can span dozens of symptoms — a large international studyidentified more than 200of them. Some of the most common include headaches, fatigue, brain fog, and shortness of breath. It can happen after severe and mild infections, in both old and young people.Anywhere from 10% to 30% of people who get infected with the coronavirus will have persistent symptoms lasting at least one month, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Many with long COVIDcontinue to deal with symptomsfor many months, even more than a year after the initial infection.Scientists are pursuing many different lines of research about the possible biological mechanisms underlying the condition, hoping this research will ultimately yield meaningful treatments for the millions of people who are afflicted, sometimes with debilitating symptoms.Here are four major theories researchers are investigating.One theory some scientists are looking into is viral persistence. The idea is that someone catches the SARS-CoV-2 virus and eventually gets over the initial infection, but it's possible the virus sticks around in some parts of the body, causing the kinds of persistent symptoms seen in long COVID patients."That's one of the first questions we need to answer," saysDr. Walter Koroshetz, director of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. "Is COVID hiding in the body somewhere?"This wouldn't be unprecedented. Other viruses are known to linger in parts of the body for months or even years, creating a "viral reservoir" in places where the immune system is not as likely to root it out, saysAmy Proal, a microbiologist at the PolyBio Research Foundation, who hasproposed a variety of theoriesfor what could be causing long COVID."Pathogens, in simple terms, tend to hide in tissue and, in fact, they have a lot of mechanisms to do that," she says. "The proteins they create allow them to better burrow into tissue."For example, scientists have foundevidence of the virus that causesEbola in tissue and body fluids long after the initial infection. Some Ebola survivors suffer from  chronic symptoms, and they appear to have waxing and waning immune responses against the virus, as if they were still infected, Proal says. Recent research even suggests an outbreak of Ebola in West Africaoriginated with someone who was infected  years earlierand had harbored the virus.Some studies suggestthe coronavirus remainsin parts of the body, including the gut, well after someone has recovered, although this doesn't necessarily mean the person can spread the virus easily.This theory of viral persistence would also explain why some people with long COVID start to feel betterafter receiving the COVID vaccines, because the shot would essentially boost their immune response against the lingering virus. A team at Yale School of Medicine iscurrently studyingthis possibility. .The long COVID patients that come to seeDr. Nancy Klimasremind her a lot of another group of patients she's used to treating — people withchronic fatigue syndrome, also called ME/CFS."That's an illness that more often than not is post viral," says Klimas, an immunologist at NOVA Southeastern University. "There's a virus that just pushes the on button on the immune system and doesn't seem to release it."ME/CFS isn't fully understood, either, but Klimas says the viruses that trigger it tend to be the most inflammatory — similar to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which can be so deadly because it creates such an extraordinarily inflammatory reaction. "So it's not too surprising that the coronavirus would be another trigger of a similar illness," she says.Many patients and researchers hope that all the attention on long COVID will offer new insights about the mechanisms underlying ME/CFS and other post-viral illnesses, because with the coronavirus there are now so many people who can recall the details of the origin of the illness, saysDr. Peter Roweof Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine."Part of our hope is that the increased interest is going to bring in more scientific firepower to help tackle these unanswered questions," he says.It's possible the virus has triggered autoimmunity in some long COVID patients. This is when a person's own immune system gets confused and attacks tissues and organs in the body.Researchers have found that a coronavirus infection can lead the body to create certain proteins, called "autoantibodies," that can end up being harmful. Autoantibodies are seen in many autoimmune diseases."We found that COVID-19 patients had astonishing numbers of autoantibodies that were actually more than what we see in autoimmune conditions like lupus," saysDr. Aaron Ring, an immunologist at Yale School of Medicine.Ring is part of a research team that'sidentified some of these autoantibodiesin sick COVID-19 patients. "A lot of the autoantibodies were actually directed against the immune system itself," he says, calling it "immune fratricide."Those autoantibodies were also directed at many other parts of the body, from the brain and central nervous system to blood vessels and platelets. So far, it appears these autoantibodies can hang around in some patients who had COVID-19 for many months, if not longer."That could explain the diverse outcomes that we see in terms of long COVID and how it manifests, but this isn't proven yet," Ring says.One more idea: It could be thatotherviruses people had before getting the coronavirus reemerge during the infection and start to cause problems.These viruses may have been kept in check when the person was healthy, but it's possible that fighting the SARS-CoV-2 virus dysregulates and throws off their immune system. "This provides a very good atmosphere for these other viruses to reactivate and potentially infect new nerves, new tissue or the central nervous system, even in the brain," says Proal.Under this scenario, viruses other than the coronavirus could be contributing to the chronic symptoms seen in long COVID. In fact, arecent studyfound that long COVID patients were more likely to have reactivation of the Epstein-Barr virus — what causes mononucleosis — suggesting COVID-19 caused that virus to reactivate.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Deepa ShivaramA Palestinian medic administers a dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID vaccine during an inoculation campaign at a medical center in Gaza City on Aug. 23.Majdi Fathi/NurPhoto via Getty Imageshide captionA Palestinian medic administers a dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID vaccine during an inoculation campaign at a medical center in Gaza City on Aug. 23.The Food and Drug Administrationhas givenits full approval of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, calling it a "key achievement for public health."The two-dose vaccine is nowfully approvedfor people ages 16 and older. For those who are ages 12 to 15 and for those who are immunocompromised and need a booster shot, the vaccine is still available under an FDA emergency use authorization.The approval, says the FDA, means "the public can be very confident that this vaccine meets the high standards for safety, effectiveness, and manufacturing quality the FDA requires of an approved product."Back in December 2020, the FDA allowed the Pfizer vaccine to be used under anemergency use authorization. Pfizer and BioNTech applied for full approval in May.Now that it has gone through a full review by a U.S. regulator, this final stamp of approval means the Pfizer vaccine can now be marketed with other approved vaccines and drugs.The process of final approval, outlined by theFDA, requires an analysis of the drug's benefits that also examines its risks and looks at clinical trials from the drugmaker. Much of this was already done when the FDA authorized the vaccine's emergency use.But among the measures the FDA required for full approval that weren't required for emergency use were data on how people fared six months after being fully vaccinated. The FDA also inspected manufacturing facilities in the intervening months.The final approval also means the Pfizer vaccine gets a brand name: Comirnaty (it's pronounced koe-mir'-na-tee, according to the FDA).The FDA still does not recommend that childrenunder age 12get the Pfizer vaccine.Janet Woodcock, the acting FDA chief, said it "would be a great concern" for children under 12 to get the vaccine, as the FDA does not have the data on what the proper dosage would be or data on the safety of the vaccine for younger kids."They are not just small adults. We have learned that time and time again," she said.Peter Marks, the director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said that trials regarding vaccinating children under 12 are still ongoing and that the FDA is waiting for data to be submitted.The American Academy of Pediatrics alsowarned doctorsnot to give vaccines to children under 12 until authorized by the FDA.A health care worker fills a syringe with the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine at the American Museum of Natural History in New York.Mary Altaffer/APhide captionA health care worker fills a syringe with the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine at the American Museum of Natural History in New York.There isn't a lot of clarity on this. Law professor Lindsay Wiley from American University in Washington, D.C.,told NPRit's an open question right now whether having the full approval makes a difference in terms of legal authority to issue a vaccination requirement.She said a few court cases have started to navigate the legal aspects of what it would mean for states and private employers to require a person to accept an unapproved product — but so far, it seems that courts are not eager to use FDA approval as a limitation on vaccine mandates.It's likely we'll see more vaccine requirements put in place now that there is one vaccine with full FDA approval.TheDefense Department, for example, has already announced that all service members will berequiredto get the vaccine now that the FDA has approved the Pfizer vaccine. Without the approval, it would have taken a presidential waiver to allow the secretary of defense to require service members to be vaccinated.Even before the FDA's full approval of the Pfizer vaccine, federal departments including the departments of Health and Human Services and Veterans Affairs hadmandatedthat their employees who work with patients get the vaccine.Misty Cunningham yells at a passing motorist outside Winchester Medical Center on Aug. 10 in Winchester, Va.

Health care workers went on strike over a COVID-19 vaccine mandate by their employer Valley Health.Outside of government entities, it's possible that more universities will require vaccines for adults over age 18, something that many states have long required for meningitis, for example.New York City, the country's largest public school district,announced its own vaccine mandatefor teachers and staff on Monday morning. New Jersey alsoannounced a mandatefor teachers and state workers on Monday.Health officials are hoping the full approval will provide some peace of mind for those who have felt hesitant about getting vaccinated."While millions of people have already safely received COVID-19 vaccines, we recognize that for some, the FDA approval of a vaccine may now instill additional confidence to get vaccinated," Woodcock of the FDA said.The White House's chief medical adviser, Dr. Anthony Fauci, toldNPR'sAll Things Consideredthat he estimates the FDA's "official stamp of approval" will convince as many as 20% of the 90 million vaccine-eligible people in the U.S. who are still unvaccinated to sign up."I believe that those people will now step forward and get vaccinated," he said.AKaiser Family Foundationsurvey from June showed that roughly 30% of unvaccinated adults who felt hesitant about the vaccine said a full approval would mean they would be more likely to get vaccinated.But the same survey showed that two-thirds of adults either already believe the vaccines available in the U.S. are fully approved by the FDA or are unsure if they have approval.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

It's a question on many parents' minds as students return to in-person school amid a huge wave of coronavirus infections. Masking is a key safety measure in schools for all kids, especially for children too young to be eligible for any COVID-19 vaccine.Arecent studyinvolving 100 school districts and 14 charter schools in North Carolina found that masks were effective at preventing in-school transmission of COVID-19 — even with physical distancing of less than 3 feet.We asked several experts what parents should consider when it comes to masks for their kids. They all agreed that the most important thing is to choose one that a child will actually wear properly all day long.Here's more of their advice:A mask is only protective if your child is actually wearing it. For younger kids especially, you want to choose a mask that is comfortable, so they won't fiddle with it all day long, saysIbukun Kalu, an infectious disease pediatrician at Duke University."I would advise using the most comfortable mask, but at least ensure that it's a double-layer cotton mask," she says — and don't use one with an exhaust valve. (A three-layer mask is a great option if can you find it.) Multiple studies have shown that tightly woven cotton fabrics do a surprisingly good job of filtering out particles, and their performance can actually improve under humid conditions, such as those created when you breathe.Most importantly, pick a mask that fits closely over the nose and mouth and down to the chin — bonus if it has adjustable ear loops and/or an adjustable nose piece. Remember: A snug fit is key to having a protective mask, so make sure your kid's mask doesn't gape open along the edges.Kids tend to be messy, so it's a good idea to throw an extra mask in their backpacks in case the one they're wearing gets soiled or sweaty, saysTina Tan, a pediatric infectious disease physician at Lurie Children's Hospital in Chicago. She says that's one reason parents might want to choose cloth masks over disposable ones for their kids."If the mask gets a little bit wet and it's very uncomfortable, they could go through two or three [masks] a day, so it could get more costly," she says. "Whereas with the cloth mask, if you buy a couple of them, you could wash them in between."Many kids like to wear gaiters because they're easy to pull up and down and they don't have any ear loops to fuss with. But while any mask is better than no mask, "I would really put [gaiters] way at the bottom of the list," saysYvonne Maldonado, a pediatrics and infectious disease specialist at Stanford University who also serves as chair of the Committee on Infectious Diseases for the American Academy of Pediatrics."They might look kind of cute for some people, but they really aren't doing too much because they stretch so much and the fabric is really porous," she says. "Everything can just come right through."If your child can wear it comfortably, now would be the time to add a filter to the mask, saysLinsey Marr, a researcher at Virginia Tech who studies how viruses transmit in the air. She's also the mother of two children, one of whom is still too young to be vaccinated. "Right now I'm emphasizing [to them], 'You have to have the filter in there. We need our best mask game right now," Marr says.Many masks are sold with a filter layer built in. If your cloth mask has a pocket for a filter, Marr suggests inserting a good-quality surgical mask, because they're made of material that's very efficient at filtering out particles. Cut the surgical mask to fit inside the pocket if need be. She says HEPA filters cut out from the filters used in portable air cleaners also work well (here's her how-to video).Double-masking is also an option, she says. Your child would wear a surgical mask closest to their face, with a snug-fitting cloth mask on top to eliminate any gaps. The goal is to "achieve good filtration and fit, which are both key to having a protective mask," Marr says.However, not everyone agrees that double-masking is necessary. So if your kid finds this uncomfortable, skip it.While child-size KN95 respirators do exist now, they're not necessary, says Tan — and like double masking, they can be uncomfortable to wear for long periods of time.Maldonado agrees that a KN95 isn't needed, but she also understands that some people's risk tolerance is a lot lower than others'. "If people feel more comfortable with a KN95 and their child can wear it, I don't have a problem with it."Another important consideration with KN95s is fit. For these types of respirators to work as effectively as billed (blocking out at least 95% of small airborne particles), they have to fit really well. A poor-fitting KN95 might not be all that protective for your child and could give a false sense of security.Kids are proving capable of learning to wear their masks correctly, which is key to their effectiveness. "I've been rather impressed by how well kids are able to keep on their mask. We've seen good compliance," says Kalu, who was part of the research team that found masks worked to curb transmissions in North Carolina schools.But not every child knows proper mask etiquette, she says, so it's important for parents to model that behavior. That means making sure kids know how to put the mask on properly — with the adjustable nose piece worn on top of their nose bridge, not under their nostrils, for example, and without gaps around their face. It also means knowing not to touch the front of the mask, she says, lest they contaminate their fingers.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

The Food and Drug Administrationthis weekgave full approval to the vaccine for people 16 and older.As part of the approval process, the vaccine also gets its brand name approved for use in the U.S.So, how did Pfizer and BioNTech settle on this unique moniker?The naming process started early on in the vaccine's development.Brand Institute, the naming agency behind the effort, started working with BioNTech in April 2020, accordingto the website FiercePharma. Pfizer would later join the branding team.Scott Piergrossi, Brand Institute's president of operations and communications, told FiercePharma that the goal in naming drugs is "to overlap ideas and layer meaning into a name."A nurse holds a vial containing the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine at a mobile vaccination site.Paul Hennessy/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Imageshide captionA nurse holds a vial containing the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine at a mobile vaccination site.According to Pfizer, the pharmaceutical companies wanted to emphasize COVID-19 immunization and the vaccine's core mRNA technology. They also wanted to encompass "community" and "immunity" into the final product.Comirnaty touches all of the bases.The name "represents a combination of the terms COVID-19, mRNA, community, and immunity, to highlight the first authorization of a messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine, as well as the joint global efforts that made this achievement possible with unprecedented rigor and efficiency — and with safety at the forefront — during this global pandemic," Pfizer and BioNTech said.Covuity, RnaxCovi, Kovimerna, RNXtract were all in the running.FiercePharma said BioNTech even filed these names with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office this summer.Sure, Comirnaty is a lifesaving vaccine that will helpend apandemic.But the internet doesn't care.

The Associated PressHawaii Gov. David Ige is asking people not to visit the islands, and he wants visitors and residents to limit travel to essential purposes as the state struggles with the delta variant.Marco Garcia/APhide captionHawaii Gov. David Ige is asking people not to visit the islands, and he wants visitors and residents to limit travel to essential purposes as the state struggles with the delta variant.HONOLULU — Hawaii's governor asked Monday that visitors and residents reduce travel to the islands to essential business only while the state struggles to control COVID-19 as the highly contagiousdelta variant spreadsin the community.Gov. David Ige wants to curtail travel to Hawaii through the end of October."It is a risky time to be traveling right now," he said.He said restaurant capacity has been restricted and there's limited access to rental cars.Ige stopped short of a mandate, saying it's a different time now than last year when strict travel rules that required quarantining essentially shut down Hawaii's tourism industry."Last year in March, when I first asked for visitors to postpone travel to the islands, we saw a 60% reduction in the traffic to Hawaii," Ige said. "And then certainly, ordering the mandatory quarantine of all incoming visitors reduced travel to the islands by 99.5%, essentially 100% of travelers."Things are different now with vaccines available and guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention saying fully vaccinated people can travel domestically.Ige said he supports Honolulu Mayor Rick Blangiardi's announcement to restrict indoor gatherings to 10 people and outdoor gatherings to 25.Blangiardi said the rules taking effect Wednesday would apply to weddings and other events.He's also urging people to get vaccinated.Hiro Toiya, the city's emergency management director, cited a mathematical modeling tool from the Georgia Institute of Technology to illustrate risks the community faced from large gatherings.The modeling shows there is a 20% chance that someone in a group of 10 will have the disease given the number of COVID-19 cases on Oahu now. But in a group of 100, there's a 90% chance someone will have it."So when you're looking at how transmissible delta is, we really got to control these large gatherings," Toiya said at a news conference. "The status quo is not working, and it's not acceptable."Multiple Oahu hospitals have filled their regular beds as COVID-19 cases pour into emergency rooms. The city set up a 25-cot tent outside The Queen's Medical Center - West Oahu on Friday to help handle the influx.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

Now it is calling on those planning boosters to wait.But some countries, including the United States, have already announced their intention to offer booster shots in the coming weeks.The Biden administrationsaid it would begin making available third dosesof the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines beginning on Sept. 20 to people who were eight months past their second shot.Dr. Vivek Murthy, the surgeon general, said health officials were concerned about the waning effectiveness of the vaccines over time as well as a renewed surge in cases driven by the exceptionally contagious delta variant.Hungary, where Ghebreyesus made his remarks, became the first European country to offer booster shots whenit started offering third dosesin August.Israel was the first country in the worldto offer a booster dose of the Pfizer vaccine.Ghebreyesus noted that people with compromised immune systems should get booster shots when they become available.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

Later that evening, the school district reported four COVID-19 cases in four different schools."We were so careful," says Alysha Johnson, a resident of Discovery Bay, east of San Francisco. "I'm a germaphobe. When this whole thing happened, we didn't leave the house for six months."Johnson was crushed when her toddler caught COVID-19 at a summer play group recently."It was a pretty big deal how sick he got," says Johnson. "It wasn't just a little sniffle."Her 2-year-old suffered a sore throat, a cough and a 104-degree fever. The bout lasted more than a week and sickened Alysha Johnson, her boyfriend and her sister — all of whom had been vaccinated against COVID-19.Alysha Johnson holds her now-healthy son, River, at their home in Discovery Bay, Calif. After the toddler got quite sick after a play date, his mom, his aunt and his mom's boyfriend, who'd all been vaccinated, caught what Johnson says felt "like a really bad sinus cold."

After the toddler got quite sick after a play date, his mom, his aunt and his mom's boyfriend, who'd all been vaccinated, caught what Johnson says felt "like a really bad sinus cold." Tests confirmed they all had COVID-19."It felt like a really bad sinus cold," Johnson says. "I felt exhausted. I lost my sense of taste and smell. That was the most bizarre sensation."Johnson is relieved her vaccination likely protected her against a more severe case of COVID-19. But the fact that kids are transmitting the coronavirus to family members is unnerving many parents all over the U.S. and putting extra stress on many households as children head back to school.Johnson gives River a bottle in her home in Discovery Bay.

Family members spent isolation together there this summer, after getting sick with COVID-19. Everyone has since recovered.In the two weeks leading up to classes, 3,255 students tested positive for the coronavirus in theLos Angeles Unified School District. Last week, more than 3,000 students and staff members inFlorida's Brevard Public Schoolshad to go into quarantine. And inHawaii, some schools are pulling the plug on in-class learning entirely, returning to remote versions.Nationwide between Aug. 5 and Aug 12, about 121,000 children tested positive for the virus, according to theAmerican Academy of Pediatrics and the Children's Hospital Association. That's a 23% increase over the prior week."Time and time again we're seeing kids return to school and then come home — either after an exposure or sick themselves," says Nicole Braxley, an emergency medicine physician at Mercy San Juan Medical Center in Sacramento. "The virus sheds for a couple of days before the patient has symptoms. Entire families are suddenly exposed."Stephanie Chenard's 8-year-old son, Desmond, started third grade in the Bay Area last week. On the evening of the first day of class, she received an email. The school district reportedfour COVID-19 casesin four different schools."It's already started," Chenard texted us after receiving the email, including a tearful emoji in her message.She knows firsthand how much a mild pediatric case can upend family life. About a month ago, Desmond started to lose his appetite. He quickly developed a fever. Chenard grimaces, remembering the moment the family learned Desmond had tested positive for the coronavirus. The news shattered the 8-year-old."He just burst out into tears," she says.The family canceled a long-awaited summer trip to Lake Tahoe and instead isolated at home.Chenard, a 49-year-old college administrator, started making calls. She notified her son's summer camp. They suspended all activity. She alerted the public swimming pool. She fretted about whether to notify the organizers of a summer music festival. The hardest call was to a friend who had just had an organ transplant."The exposure felt like a moral failing," says Chenard.Fortunately, her son's case was mild. His fever broke the same day it started."Desmond was only sick for eight hours, but I spent 45 hours on notifications alone," Chenard says. The child's quarantine — and the rest of the family's subsequent isolation — also required both parents to juggle work and child care. Fortunately, neither parent caught the virus. Chenard feels grateful she and her husband are fully vaccinated.Some families are not so lucky.Jace Garcia caught COVID-19 playing soccer with a friend in Sacramento. The virus struck the 11-year-old in the middle of the night. Jace woke up vomiting.He curled up in the bathroom around the toilet. Body aches racked his calves, feet, chest and head."Everything was just squeezing that part of the body towards the bone," Jace says.His fever spiked to around 104 degrees. He shivered under a pile of blankets. Even playing video games did not offer relief."Every time I would click down, I would get a tingling sensation in my hand," Jace remembers. He tossed the controllers aside. "I felt dizzy."The only advice doctors offered was to try to keep him hydrated."As a parent, you feel helpless," says Rico Garcia, Jace's dad. "It was like the longest few days of my life."Rico Garcia worried he might contract the virus too. Each morning he anxiously took a rapid test. He hoped the vaccination he got would offer complete protection, but he caught avaccine breakthrough case. On the fourth morning, Rico Garcia tested positive for the coronavirus. Within 24 hours, symptoms set in.Rico Garcia and his son, Jace, enjoy a baseball game before the pandemic's start. This month, both father and son contracted COVID-19, as did Jace's mom.

This month, both father and son contracted COVID-19, as did Jace's mom. "As a parent, you feel helpless," Garcia says, of watching Jace struggle with the illness."It felt like a terrible head cold," Rico Garcia says. "My brain was foggy. I couldn't think straight."Then he lost his voice. He called in sick to the radio station where he's a DJ."My first sip of coffee was amazing," Rico Garcia remembers. "My ninth and tenth sip tasted like hot water. In the snap of a finger, my sense of taste and smell was gone. I went as far as to cut a lime open and bite into it — and tasted nothing."Eventually his ex-wife also caught the virus from their son. She's a teacher and now isolated. Jace is still fighting a lingering cough and congestion. He's also missing the first 10 days of sixth grade.Epidemiologists saybreakthrough casesare on the rise all around the U.S., though estimates vary widely because tallies depend on the degree of community masking, testing availability and the level of virus circulating regionally."Symptoms can be absent or so mild in the vaccinated, many dismiss this as a cold or seasonal allergies,"Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, a University of California, San Francisco professor and infectious disease specialist, notes in an email. "In other words, you don't know what you don't know."An internalpresentationfrom the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from late July estimated that about 35,000 people a week were contracting a symptomatic breakthrough infection in the United States. In the week leading up to July 24, about 384,000 people across the country tested positive for the coronavirus, which indicates that about 9% of new cases were likely breakthrough infections. Chin-Hong says this is probably an underestimate of the true total but it shouldn't undermine the value of vaccines in people's minds."At the end of the day, one can say why focus on breakthrough infections, as the vaccines are really meant to prevent people getting serious disease and dying — which they are still spectacular at," he says.It's still rare for a child to die from COVID-19 or to experience a case severe enough to require hospitalization. In states wheredata are available, less than 2% of pediatric cases required hospitalization and less than 0.03% were fatal.Yet, as schools open and more students test positive for the virus, parents and teachers find themselves trying to weigh the risks. Psychologically, the increased isolation of remote learning during the pandemic has been hard on many families and especially children — a fact underscored by thespike in U.S. emergency room visitsby kids for mental health issues last year.Stephanie Chenard bid her third-grader, Desmond, goodbye as he headed into his classroom last week.

Fallon/AFP via Getty Imageshide captionA nurse is handed a dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine before administering it to a college student during a mobile vaccination clinic at California State University, Long Beach on Aug. 11.The Food and Drug Administration has formally approved Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine. The widely anticipated decision replaces the emergency use authorization granted by the agency last December.The vaccine, developed by Pfizer and its partner BioNTech, is the first COVID-19 vaccine to be subject to a full review by the U.S. regulator and to get an approval that puts the vaccine on par with other marketed vaccines.The full approval could make it easier for employers, the military and universities to mandate vaccination and may reassure some people who are hesitant about the vaccine."While this and other vaccines have met the FDA's rigorous, scientific standards for emergency use authorization, as the first FDA-approved COVID-19 vaccine, the public can be very confident that this vaccine meets the high standards for safety, effectiveness, and manufacturing quality the FDA requires of an approved product,"acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock said in a statement.President Biden seized on the announcement in remarks to the nation on Monday afternoon to press for more people to get vaccinated as soon as possible."Let me say this loudly and clearly: If you're one of the millions of Americans who said that they will not get the shot until it has full and final approval of the FDA, it has now happened," he said. "The moment you've been waiting for is here. It's time for you to go get your vaccination. Get it today."The president also encouraged businesses to "step up their vaccine requirements."AJune pollfrom the Kaiser Family Foundation found that 31% of unvaccinated people said they would be more likely to get a COVID-19 vaccine once one receives full approval from the FDA."While millions of people have already safely received COVID-19 vaccines, we recognize that for some, the FDA approval of a vaccine may now instill additional confidence to get vaccinated," Woodcock said. "Today's milestone puts us one step closer to altering the course of this pandemic in the U.S."The FDA's full approval applies to people 16 and older. Those ages 12 through 15 can still receive the vaccine under the existing emergency use authorization.That authorization does not extend to children under the age of 12. FDA officials have acknowledged the interest in vaccination for children in that age group but were unable Monday to provide a timeline for a decision on use of the vaccine for those under 12."Currently there are still trials ongoing here," Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, told reporters. "The agency has to wait for the companies to submit. ... Obviously, we will move swiftly, but first the trials have to be finished ... and the data need to be submitted to us."The FDA acted Monday without convening a customary public meeting of expert advisers to vet information about the vaccine and make recommendations to the regulator.As part of the approval process, the vaccine also got a brand name: Comirnaty. The FDA says that's pronounced "koe-mir'-na-tee."As of Sunday, 73%of adults in the U.S. have had at least one doseof the Pfizer, Moderna or Johnson & Johnson vaccines. Pfizer's vaccine is most commonly administered, accounting for about 56% of the doses administered overall, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine remains under the FDA's review, but its approval is expected to follow in the near future.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

Her daughters used it and now her grandson will too.Andrea Hsu/NPRhide captionNorma Jasso, 62, sped up retirement plans after her daughter asked for help with a new baby. She stands with a highchair her father had commissioned from a shop in Sinaloa, Mexico. Her daughters used it and now her grandson will too.When Norma Jasso first started working from home in March 2020, she thought it was fun."I could wake up later, not have to commute, not have to put my pumps and my working clothes on," says Jasso, who was a regulatory case manager for San Diego Gas and Electric.But soon, her days grew longer. She found herself checking email at odd hours. She missed her colleagues. She'd been with the utility for 23 years and found joy being around people.She hadn't planned to retire for at least five years, but about a year into the pandemic, her daughter called. She was expecting her first child and wanted her mom's help. It was a request Jasso couldn't refuse."My mom helped me when I had my daughters, and so I thought, how wonderful. I could pay it back, pay it forward, pay it with love," she says.She met with a financial planner to figure out whether she had enough money to retire. To her surprise, her 401(k) retirement account had grown considerably, thanks to market gains during the pandemic.So at 62, Jasso retired.Roughly 2 million more people than expected have joined the ranks of the retired during the pandemic, according to The New School's Schwartz Center for Economic Policy Analysis.While some like Jasso happily chose to retire early, others were forced into retirement after losing their jobs or quitting out of fears of exposure to COVID-19.This doesn't mean that they're permanently out of the workforce. There's a constant flow in and out of retirement, says researcher Owen Davis, who conducted the analysis.Loading...But for older workers, the time away can make finding a new job harder, and they often return to lower wages."Age discrimination plays a role there," says Davis. "This is something we certainly saw during the Great Recession."Yvonne Grace Anderson, 74, was working as a cashier and a customer service representative at a Publix grocery store in Pensacola, Fla., when the coronavirus  first arrived in the U.S.By mid-March 2020, she was experiencing extreme anxiety on the job.

Her daughters shared her fears and implored her to stop working.My Momma@YvonneGraceAndedancing and then jumping off of the mountain at 74yo 👊🏼pic.twitter.com/t8TMjVCCN7Anderson didn't need the income. She's widowed but has enough Social Security to live off of. She worked the part-time grocery job to fund her favorite hobby, painting, and as a way to be active in the community."I'm a social butterfly," she says. "I love people. I love to hear their stories."Just before Christmas, after weathering a difficult hurricane season, she moved to rural Alabama to live with a nephew. With no easy access to transportation, she can't imagine being able to find a new job."I wish I could say that I could embrace retirement, but it scares me — not being a part of something," she says.The closest place she can think of where she might find a job is at the nearby Dollar General store, but with the delta variant surging and no one wearing masks, she's not interested."I don't want to be out there," she says.Norma Jasso and her husband, Samuel, are getting their house in San Diego ready for sale.

Joe PalcaScientists have studied the blood of people who were part of a large trial for the Moderna vaccine to measures antibodies that can help predict levels of immunity after getting a COVID-19 shot.Britta Pedersen/dpa/picture alliance via Getty Imageshide captionScientists have studied the blood of people who were part of a large trial for the Moderna vaccine to measures antibodies that can help predict levels of immunity after getting a COVID-19 shot.When Dr. Anthony Faucispoke recentlyat a White House briefing about the need for COVID-19 booster shots, buried in his slideshow of charts and data points was a little-noticed scientific paper that offers evidence for a reliable way to predict how much protection a COVID-19 vaccine offers.The studyappeared on a preprint serverearlier this month without much fanfare, but many interested in the future of COVID-19 vaccines had been eagerly awaiting the results.The researchers were looking for markers in vaccinated patients' blood that would indicate protection against COVID-19, what's known as "correlates of immunity." What the team of scientists found were neutralizing antibodies — proteins made by the immune system that are known to disarm the coronavirus.As Fauci explained, the paper showed that higher levels of these antibodies are associated with higher levels of vaccine efficacy. The findings suggest that giving people a booster vaccine, which has been shown to raise antibody levels, would go a long way toward protecting them against the coronavirus, including some of the newer and more dangerous variants.While more studies are needed to confirm the findings, discovering that these markers correlate with immune protection has implications for future COVID-19 vaccine research. It means that researchers now can measure whether a new COVID-19 vaccine might work — without necessarily having to repeat large-scale efficacy studies."That could be used as the basis for authorization and approval of vaccine candidates without needing to do these trials with 40,000 people that take a long time and a lot of expense to complete," saysPeter Gilberta biostatistician with the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, the lead author on the new study.To understand whether there is a protective level of neutralizing antibodies, a team of researchers from academic institutions, industry and the government did new research on the blood of people who participated in the large trial of the Moderna vaccine. That older trial, involving 30,000 volunteers, was the basis for the Food and Drug Administration granting Moderna emergency use authorization for its COVID-19 vaccine.This new research found 46 people in the Moderna study who had been vaccinated but subsequently got sick with COVID-19 and compared their levels of neutralizing antibodies with the levels found in a sample of 1,000 people who were vaccinated during the trial and never got sick."[The antibody levels] were always lower in the vaccinated people who became a COVID case compared to people who remained free of COVID," Gilbert says.The results show that antibody levels can be predictive of immunity, which should help develop and test new vaccines at a much faster pace. It's even possible that COVID-19 vaccine-makers may not need to conduct trials with huge numbers of people to see how many get sick after getting vaccinated. Instead, researchers could simply draw blood and look for antibody levels that correlate with protection."So maybe they would only need to study a couple of hundred people instead of tens of thousands if they wanted to show a vaccine was working," Gilbert says.The four markers of immunity identified in the paper should indicate how well a COVID-19 vaccine is working overall, but the blood test cannot tell an individual person about their level of protection.It would be great if the antibody level was a specific number, but it's not, says Emory University biostatisticianDavid Benkeser, another author on the study."Unfortunately, the story is a bit more subtle than that," he says. "We really view this as more of a continuum. Some antibodies [are] good. More are better."In fact, it's pretty clear that antibodies alone don't explain why some people are protected, and other parts of the immune system also play important roles in fighting off the coronavirus, including T-cells."Two percent of the individuals who were vaccinated had very, very low levels. Levels of antibodies that were below that lower limit of detection," saysChristopher Houchens, a biomedical researcher at the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, another author of the study. "However, about 50% of those individuals in that 2% of the population were still protected and did not come down with symptomatic COVID-19 disease."Researchers plan to do a similar analysis of the association between antibodies and vaccine-induced immunity in people who participated in the Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca COVID-vaccine trials to see if the same pattern holds.There are also plans to collect data in what are called challenge studies, where vaccinated people are deliberately infected with the coronavirus to see how well the vaccine protects them from infection or illness.Ultimately, multiple studies will be needed to convince federal regulators that antibody levels alone can be sufficient evidence to support authorization and approval of a future COVID-19 vaccine.That's not a surprise."Science is not simple," saysHolly Janes, a biostatistician at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center who worked on designing the antibody study. "It's not clean and tidy. Looking at things in different ways, in different types of studies, different types of analyses and different data sources is important, and that's how we get at the truth. There's hardly ever one study that tells us everything we need to know."Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Shannon BondFacebook is defending itself from accusations from the White House and other critics that it's not doing enough to curb health misinformation.Olivier Douliery/AFP via Getty Imageshide captionFacebook is defending itself from accusations from the White House and other critics that it's not doing enough to curb health misinformation.A news story suggesting the COVID-19 vaccine may have been involved in a doctor's death was the most viewed link on Facebook in the U.S. in the first three months of the year.But Facebook held back from publishing a report with that information, the company acknowledged on Saturday.The social media giant prepared the report about the most widely viewed posts on its platform from January through March of 2021, but decided not to publish it "because there were key fixes to the system we wanted to make," spokesperson Andy Stonetweetedon Saturday.TheNew York Timesfirstreportedthe existence of the shelved report on Friday, two days after Facebook published a similarreportabout top posts from the second quarter. Facebook executives debated about publishing the earlier report but decided to withhold it over concerns it would make the company look bad, theTimesreported.Facebook has come under pressure from theBiden administrationand othercriticswho argue it hasn't done enough to curb the spread ofmisinformationabout the pandemic and vaccines."We're guilty of cleaning up our house a bit before we invited company. We've been criticized for that; and again, that's not unfair," Stone wrote on Saturday. He said the company had decided to release the previously unpublishedfirst-quarter reportbecause of the interest it had sparked.But Stone also emphasized that the article raising questions about possible connections between the vaccine and death illustrated "just how difficult it is to define misinformation."While Facebook bars posts that contain false information about COVID and vaccines or that discourage people from getting vaccinated, it takes the position that it's more effective to allow people to discuss potential risks and questions about health, rather than banning such content.Thearticle, written by theSouth Florida Sun Sentineland republished by theChicago Tribune, was headlined "A 'healthy' doctor died two weeks after getting a COVID-19 vaccine; CDC is investigating why." The article was factual. When it was originally published in January, it noted that no link had been found between the shot and the Miami doctor's death. (The page now carries an update from April saying the medical examiner said therewasn't enough evidenceto conclude whether the vaccine played a role in the doctor's death.)Many news outlets covered the story, but theTribunelink gained the most traction on Facebook: it was viewed by nearly 54 million U.S. users between January and March, according to the company's report.Experts who study online platforms say these kinds of stories present challenges for social media companies, because while they do not break the platforms' rules against posting false information about COVID and vaccines, they are often used by anti-vaccination advocates to advance misleading narratives and fuel doubt in vaccines.TheTribunelink was shared on the social network by several accounts that regularly raise doubts about vaccination, according to Crowdtangle, a research tool owned by Facebook.In March, NPR found that on almost half of all the days so far in 2021, a story about someone dying after receiving a vaccine shot was among themost popular vaccine-related articleson social media, according to data from the media intelligence company NewsWhip. TheTribunelink about the Florida doctor topped that list.Editor's note:Facebook is among NPR's financial supporters.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

The Associated PressBroward County Schools Interim Superintendent Dr. Vickie L. Cartwright greets students on Aug. 16 at North Lauderdale Elementary School.Joe Cavaretta/South Florida Sun-Sentinel via APhide captionBroward County Schools Interim Superintendent Dr. Vickie L. Cartwright greets students on Aug. 16 at North Lauderdale Elementary School.MIAMI — Florida officials are threatening to withhold funds equal to the salaries of school board members if school districts in two counties don't immediately do away with strict mask mandates as the state continues to battle through high hospitalization rates.School boards in Broward and Alachua counties received a warning Friday from the State Board of Education giving them 48 hours to walk back their decisions to require masks for all students, only exempting those with a doctor's note. Broward County has the second-largest school district in the state."We cannot have government officials pick and choose what laws they want to follow," said Commissioner of Education Richard Corcoran in an emailed statement. "These are the initial consequences to their intentional refusal to follow state law and state rule to purposefully and willingly violate the rights of parents."Corcoran said the two districts are violating the Parents' Bill of Rights and a late July executive order by Gov. Ron DeSantis that prompted rules limiting how far districts can go with mask requirements.The Republican governor has pushed for school districts not to mandate masks for all students, ordering the state's health and education departments to devise rules so that parents can choose. Corcoran was recommended to the post by DeSantis and appointed by the State Board of Education in 2019.DeSantis maintains masks can be detrimental for children's development and that younger children simply don't wear masks properly. But board members in the counties of Broward, home to Fort Lauderdale, and Alachua, home to Gainesville, decided not to allow parents to easily opt out of the mandate as surging cases fueled by the delta variant began straining hospitals.Florida on Friday surpassed 3 million total COVID-19 cases since the beginning of the pandemic, according to a weekly report from the state's health department. It also reported 1,486 new deaths in a week, significantly raising the seven-day average of reported deaths per day from 153 to 212 over the past week.The state continued to have the highest hospitalization rates in the country, with 16,849 patients with COVID-19 — 3,500 of them in intensive care, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.Later Friday, Sarasota County became the sixth school district in the state to adopt a stricter mask policy. Two other school districts — Hillsborough and Palm Beach counties — had originally started the school year allowing parents to easily opt out of wearing masks, but tightened their measures this week. And the school board of the state's largest district in Miami-Dade County adopted the same policy of only allowing mask exemptions with a doctor's note.Because of the size of the school districts' budgets, the cuts are more symbolic than harmful. According to the Legislature's Office of Economic and Demographic Research, school board members in Alachua County make $40,000 per year and in Broward County, $46,000. Alachua has about 30,000 students and a $258 million general fund budget. Broward County has about 270,000 students and a $2.7 billion general fund budget.Corcoran's orders require that school districts provide information regarding the compensation of school board members who voted to impose strict mandates if they don't immediately reverse their decisions. It also outlines it will begin to withhold from state funds the amount equal to their monthly salary, prohibiting districts from cutting funds in other areas such as teachers pay or student services.U.S. Education Secretary Miguel Cardona spoke Friday with the superintendents of the two school districts and told them they should use federal pandemic relief funds to make up for any financial sanctions. President Joe Biden later expressed his support on Twitter."We will do everything we can to support local school districts in safely reopening schools. American Rescue Plan funds can be used to backfill the salaries of the brave Florida school board members, superintendents, and other educators keeping our children safe," Biden said on Twitter.Earlier in the day, DeSantis attacked the Biden administration's response, calling it "absolutely outrageous" and governmental "overreach.""To have the federal government come in and overrule the rights of the parents as if they know better?" DeSantis said at a news conference Friday. "They want to kneecap the parents and empower teachers unions."Broward school board President Rosalind Osgood stood by the board's decision, saying the governor was "overreaching his authority." In a statement, she said the district has asked its lawyers to explore legal challenges, promising a response to Friday's order within 48 hours as requested.It's unclear what will happen with the state funds if a judge decides to block DeSantis' order regarding masks. On Thursday, a state judge cleared the way for a three-day trial next week on a lawsuit from parents challenging DeSantis.In asking that the lawsuit be dismissed, attorneys for the governor contended that the governor's order simply upholds a law that gives parents the right to make health care decisions. The law makes no specific mention of masks.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

Hong Kong's government said Thursday that it had recently granted a quarantine exemption to someone to perform "designated professional work" after reports surfaced that Kidman did not have to undergo a quarantine.Willy Sanjuan/Willy Sanjuan/Invision/APhide captionActress Nicole Kidman speaks at in Pasadena, Calif., on Jan. 15, 2020. Hong Kong's government said Thursday that it had recently granted a quarantine exemption to someone to perform "designated professional work" after reports surfaced that Kidman did not have to undergo a quarantine.HONG KONG — Hong Kong's granting of a quarantine exemption to Hollywood star Nicole Kidman is drawing criticism from lawmakers as the city tightens entry restrictions for international travelers to control the coronavirus.Kidman, who reportedly flew to Hong Kong last week from coronavirus-hit Sydney, was exempted from a weeklong quarantine and was spotted in the city this week filming a new Amazon Prime Video series titled "Expats," according to local media reports.The government said in a statement Thursday that it had granted the exemption "for the purpose of performing designated professional work."It said the work was "conducive to maintaining the necessary operation and development of Hong Kong's economy."Some Hong Kong lawmakers criticized the decision."Nicole Kidman's exemption case is not just about politics, it involves the health security issue and is a matter of unfairness," said lawmaker Priscilla Leung.Leung said she herself was not exempted from quarantine when a family member was infected with the coronavirus.Kidman's exemption sets a precedent for other celebrities in the future, said lawmaker Michael Tien."(Even) our athletes who came back from the Tokyo Olympics were required to have seven days of quarantine," he said.Kidman's exemption comes as the Hong Kong government has tightened entry requirements for travelers, adding 15 countries including the U.S. to the high-risk category and requiring vaccinated travelers from medium-risk countries to spend 14 days in quarantine effective Friday.Previously, those traveling from medium-risk countries could quarantine for just seven days in a designated hotel if they had a valid vaccination record and a positive COVID-19 antibodies test.Authorities say Kidman is obliged to comply with virus rules in Hong Kong, and is required to submit an itinerary and travel in a private vehicle to avoid contact with the public."With this exemption, it doesn't mean that she can go anywhere she wants," Edward Yau, Hong Kong's secretary for commerce and economic development, said Friday.Reactions from residents were mixed."I think the quarantine period cannot be shortened, because we all know that you can still test positive even after 14 days of quarantine, and even if you are vaccinated," said Sum Yip, a nursing student. "If the government shortens the quarantine period, it cannot protect the people."But David Peatfield, a teacher from the U.K., said he did not mind the exemption for Kidman because she was vaccinated and her series would bring "good publicity" to Hong Kong.He said filming the series in Hong Kong would also bring jobs to the city.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Joanne LuCOVID-19 vaccines from COVAX, the international vaccine-sharing program, arrive in Khartoum, Sudan, on Aug. 5. In a letter to President Biden, health experts are asking him to take action to manufacture and distribute vaccines to the entire world.Ebrahim Hamid/AFP via Getty Imageshide captionCOVID-19 vaccines from COVAX, the international vaccine-sharing program, arrive in Khartoum, Sudan, on Aug. 5. In a letter to President Biden, health experts are asking him to take action to manufacture and distribute vaccines to the entire world.What if the U.S. decided to vaccinate the rest of the world against COVID-19?That's what more than 175 health experts proposed to President Biden in anAug. 10 lettersent to senior White House officials and shared withThe Washington Post."We urge you to act now," the letter reads. "Announcing within the next 30 days an ambitious global vaccine manufacturing program is the only way to control this pandemic, protect the precious gains made to date and build vaccine infrastructure for the future."The experts are asking the Biden administration to do three things:Only 24% of the world's 7.8 billion people have been fully vaccinated,according to figurescompiled by Our World In Data, which gets its information from governments and health ministries. If the letter's proposal is adopted, 4 billion people – more than half the global population – could be fully vaccinated by the end of 2021 with U.S.-manufactured doses.These are highly ambitious goals. But the signatories say they are necessary to curb rising infection rates as the delta variant surges in Africa, Latin America and Asia – regions where vaccines are least available. These measures can also protect against emerging variants, some of which may be resistant to current vaccines.To better understand the letter's demands, we spoke withDr. Paul Farmer, a Harvard Medical School professor and co-founder of the global health organization Partners In Health, who co-signed the letter alongside health academics, civil society leaders and others. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.Why did you and your colleagues decide to draft and send the letter?This is a group of global health folks with long experience responding to health crises in this country and in others. But this time, we have some new tools that are revolutionary. In sharp contrast to global plagues in the past, not even a year after identifying the pathogen, we have these highly effective vaccines, particularly mRNA vaccines. [The COVAX goal of] hitting 20% of the populations [of low-income countries] in the coming year is low. So, we thought, is there a way for us to spur into action what we see as a fairly supportive administration in Washington?Is it fair to single out the U.S. to shoulder the global burden of vaccinating against COVID-19? Why not ask other wealthy countries to chip in?It's not fair. We're cognizant that we're asking the U.S. to do more than any other country. But we have the vaccines and the technology [to cover the vaccination gap for the whole world]. So, it's a wonderful opportunity for us to say no to vaccine nationalism and yes to establishing a global standard of care for COVID and prevention of COVID.Also, most of the signatories of the letter are Americans. So, we're begging our own country to do more because we think it can and we think it should.Is this going to be an impossible challenge?It's not impossible. Otherwise, we wouldn't have pushed the Biden administration so hard on the specifics. Is it going to be difficult? It sure is. We came to those big numbers by looking at the projected need and also the likelihood, if not certainty, that boosters would be needed. But we think the Biden administration has the resolve and wherewithal to do it.We learned from the success of PEPFAR [President George W. Bush's HIV/AIDS initiative] that the higher we set our goals, the more people are enrolled in care and the more children protected. We're not drawing on nothing. We're not trying to be unreasonable. We're trying to be optimistic and audacious because that's what the moment calls for.What first step would you like the Biden administration to take toward meeting the demands in the letter?I'd like to see us facilitate vaccine production in Africa. They deserve a chance, especially because they have the highest burden of lethal infectious disease. If we are going to be pushing boosters on top of trying to vaccinate the whole continent against COVID, it's hard for us to see any option other than on-continent production.Is there a place in particular that you think would make a great vaccine production hub?I'm confident this could be done within months or a year in Rwanda, which has rolled out a very effective health-care delivery system – from community health workers to clinics to district hospitals to referral hospitals – over the last 15 years. And certainly South Africa, which is already a vaccine producer.COVAXwas supposed to ensurethat vaccines were distributed equitably around the world. Does the fact that you and your colleagues felt compelled to send this letter mean COVAX has failed?Looking at history, we've never pulled off a global vaccine rollout as quickly as we're trying to now. It took us almost two centuries to declare smallpox vanquished after a vaccine was developed. Even antiretroviral therapy for HIV took the better part of a decade for its widespread delivery. So, I'm not sure we find ourselves in the midst of some epic failure.This is the most rapid development of novel vaccines that we have ever seen. Now the task is to see who can help us shorten the time between development and delivery. There's nobody in the world that can do more on this than the Biden administration.Have you received a response from the Biden administration?We don't need or expect a letter back. Many of us have friends there, so we have a pretty good idea that some of the best people in the administration don't think this is a bad idea or imprudent or ridiculous. Of course, the buck stops with the boss, and the boss is President Biden. But our experience [as global health experts] with this administration so far has been a positive one.So do I think we will see some response to this? I think we will.Joanne Lu is a freelance journalist who covers global poverty and inequity. Her work has appeared inHumanosphere,The Guardian,Global WashingtonandWar is Boring.

Many hospitals in Israel are at full capacity following a sharp increase in coronavirus infections.Israel was the first country on Earth to fully vaccinate a majority of its citizens against COVID-19. Now it has one of the world's highest daily infection rates — an average of nearly 7,500 confirmed cases a day, double what it was two weeks ago. Nearly one in every 150 people in Israel today has the virus.What happened, and what can be learned about the vaccine's impact on a highly vaccinated country? Here are six lessons learned — and one looming question for the future of the pandemic.About Goats and SodaGoats and Soda isNPR's global health and development blog. We tell stories of life in our changing world, focusing on low- and middle-income countries. And we keep in mind that we're all neighbors in this global village.Sign up for our weekly newsletter.Israel had fully vaccinated slightlyover halfits population by March 25. Infections waned, venues reopened to the vaccinated and the prime minister told Israelis to go out and have fun. By June, all restrictions, including indoor masking, were abolished.But Israel paid a price for the early rollout. Health officials, and then Pfizer, said their data showed a dip in the vaccine's protection around six months after receiving the second shot.It was a perfect storm: The vaccine's waning protection came around the same time the more infectious delta variant arrived in Israel this summer. Delta accounts for nearly all infections in Israel today."The most influential event was so many people who went abroad in the summer — vacations — and brought the delta variant very, very quickly to Israel," said Siegal Sadetzki, a former public health director in Israel's Health Ministry.The good news is that among Israel's serious infections on Thursday of this week, according to Health Ministry data, the rate of serious cases among unvaccinated people over age 60 (178.7 per 100,000) was nine times more than the rate among fully vaccinated people of the same age category, and the rate of serious cases among unvaccinated people in the under-60 crowd (3.2 per 100,000) was a little more than double the rate among vaccinated people in that age bracket.The bad news,doctors say, is that half of Israel's seriously ill patients who are currently hospitalized were fully vaccinated at least five months ago. Most of them are over 60 years old and have comorbidities. The seriously ill patients who are unvaccinated are mostly young, healthy people whose condition deteriorated quickly.Israel's daily average number of infections has nearly doubled in the past two weeks and has increased around tenfold since mid-July, approaching the numbers during Israel's peak in the winter. Deaths increased from five in June to at least 248 so far this month. Health officials say that currently 600 seriously ill patients are hospitalized, and they warn they cannot handle more than 1,000 serious infections at the same time.Popular Goats and Soda StoriesHow Inuit Parents Teach Kids To Control Their AngerAre We Raising Unhelpful, Bossy Kids? Here's The FixTo Fix That Pain In Your Back, You Might Have To Change The Way You SitThe country jumped out ahead of all other countries on vaccines, and 78% of eligible Israelis over 12 years old are vaccinated.But Israel has a young population, with many under the eligible age for vaccination, and about 1.1 million eligible Israelis, largely between the ages of 12 and 20, have declined to take even one dose of the vaccine.That means only 58% of Israel's total citizenry is fully vaccinated. Experts say that's not nearly high enough."We have a very large fraction of our population who are paying the price for a small fraction of the population who did not go to get the vaccine," saidEran Segalof the Weizmann Institute of Science, who advises the Israeli government  on COVID-19.Unvaccinated people helped fuel the rapid spread of the virus while the country remained open for business in recent months with few serious restrictions."That will lead to mass infection, which is exactly what we are seeing now," said Segal.Israel is trying to slow the wave without resorting to a new lockdown, which Prime Minister Naftali Bennett says would take an economic toll and "destroy the future of the country." The country is placing caps on gatherings, increasing hospital staff and pleading for unvaccinated people to get immunized.On Israel's doorstep, the vaccination rate is much lower in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Only around 8% of Palestinians have been fully vaccinated. Palestinians are wary of certain brands of vaccine in ample supply, like AstraZeneca's, while Pfizer-BioNTech's vaccine is in shorter supply for Palestinians. But the Palestinian population is not a source of transmission in Israel. Only vaccinated Palestinians are given permits to enter Israel and Israeli settlements.As for the low rate of vaccination in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, "we don't have a shortage of vaccine. It is the hesitancy," said Randa Abu Rabe, a local World Health Organization official working in the Palestinian territories.An Israeli health worker administers a third dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine at a vaccination center in Jerusalem. Israel is the first country to launch a national booster campaign for the Pfizer vaccine.Menahem Kahana/AFP via Getty Imageshide captionAn Israeli health worker administers a third dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine at a vaccination center in Jerusalem. Israel is the first country to launch a national booster campaign for the Pfizer vaccine.Israel is the first country to offer a third shot of the Pfizer vaccine in a nationwide booster campaign. Preliminary research in Israel suggests booster shots significantly increase protection against the coronavirus a week after a person receives the third dose.Israeli national HMO Maccabi Healthcare Services, which conducted the preliminary study of 149,144 Israelis who received three Pfizer shots, said for Israelis above age 60, a Pfizer booster shot reduced the chances of infection by 86% and reduced the chances of severe infection by 92%.The early data reflects studies by vaccine-makers Pfizer and Moderna and provides a glimpse at boosters' effects in a real-world setting.After reviewing data on breakthrough infections in Israel, the U.S. announced a booster shot campaign beginning in late September for anyone eight months after their second shot. The U.K. has promised boosters soon, and Turkey is offering Pfizer shots to those immunized with the Sinovac vaccine to help citizens planning to travel, since some countries will not recognize the Chinese vaccine.Israel has lowered the minimum age for boosters to 40. "The triple dose is the solution to curbing the current infection outbreak," Anat Ekka Zohar of Maccabi said in a statement.Boosters are not being offered in the Palestinian territories yet, and the World Health Organization has called on countries to stop giving COVID-19 booster shots in order to help poorer countries get vaccinated."Israel very much respects the World Health Organization but acts according to local considerations and the interests of Israeli citizens. We help the world a lot," an Israeli health official told NPR, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the issue. "If the U.N. didn't secure enough vaccines for Chad, Mali, Myanmar and Guatemala, that doesn't mean that Israel shouldn't seek to prevent a pandemic from happening here."Experts warn if countries do not vaccinate their populations, more variants will develop, threatening even vaccinated nations.The Cinema City movie theater complex in Jerusalem teems with young children and parents, but steps from the box office is a makeshift vaccination station where dozens of mostly older residents wait their turn to get booster shots.More than a million Israelis have received a Pfizer booster shot in the last several weeks. They are being watched around the world, as Israel is the first nation to give a third dose of Pfizer on a mass scale, just as it was ahead of the curve on the first round of shots."They make the test of us," said Etti Ben Yaakov, sitting in a vaccination booth with her brother as he got a booster shot. "But in the first [round], it was the same. So I don't feel it's something wrong. I think it's good."She predicts the coronavirus, like the flu, will mean shots every year. "We will have to live with the corona," she said.Ido Hadari, of HMO Maccabi, which led the preliminary booster shot study, questioned whether regular shots will become the norm."I don't know of any disease where we are vaccinated every six months, and to be honest, I don't think the public will come to get vaccinated every six months," Hadari said. "But you cannot predict anything with this disease."An earlier version of this story misspelled the Weizmann Institute of Science as the Weitzmann Institute of Science.An earlier version of this story misspelled the Weizmann Institute of Science as the Weitzmann Institute of Science.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

John Bel Edwards' mask mandate for schools shout in opposition to wearing a face covering at the Board of Elementary and Secondary Education meeting on Wednesday in Baton Rouge, La.Tom Leonard, the superintendent of Eanes Independent School District in Austin, Texas, is desperately trying to keep "mask wars" out of his schools.But the subject of masking is so polarizing that parents are becoming violent toward the very people they entrust their children with.During a back-to-school event this week, an angry parentripped a mask offa teacher's face. Others yelled at a teacher who was wearing a mask, saying they could not understand her while her face was covered.Leonard had to write a note asking people to "be kind" to educators."I just do not want the mask wars occurring in my schools," Leonard told NPR. "I don't want my principals and teachers and bus drivers dedicating any of their limited bandwidth to fighting with either parents or kids.""Take it outside," he said.But fights like this are erupting across the United States.Leonard said he has been talking with education leaders and friends in California, Illinois and New York who say similar issues are cropping up in their school districts too. "This is everywhere," Leonard said.Law enforcement officials have been called in to curb angry protesters at school board meetings in states such asNevadaandPennsylvania.  In one school district inColorado, sheriff's deputies were called to stand outside a few schools on the first day of classes to make sure protests didn't disrupt learning. And in Salt Lake City, protesters who disrupted a school board meeting this year are now facingcriminal charges.Joann Marcus (left) cheers as she listens to the Broward County School Board's emergency meeting last month in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.

At a California elementary school, a parent has been banned from campus afterattackinga principal and teacher over the mask-mandate policy.Leonard said the aggressive incidents that took place this week were "isolated" but reflective of the long-standing tension in the community amid the coronavirus pandemic and the politicization of wearing masks."Somewhere along the line this got politicized. Somewhere along the line, some people decided to fight the battles in our schools. ... We have other things to focus on," he said.Despite the disruptions, those protesting mask mandates in schools are in the minority nationwide.A recent Axios-Ipsospollshowed a majority of Americans — 69% — support mask mandates in schools. But opinion is starkly divided by political party: 92% of Democrats support a mandate versus just 44% of Republicans."The bottom line is, this is a vocal minority," said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers. "The people who are acting out this way are doing it to intimidate and to bully. And there has to be consequences to that kind of behavior."Families protest any potential mask mandates before the Hillsborough County School Board meeting last month in Tampa, Fla.Octavio Jones/Getty Imageshide captionFamilies protest any potential mask mandates before the Hillsborough County School Board meeting last month in Tampa, Fla.Weingarten said it's also likely more schools will increase the presence of law enforcement if incidents that harm educators and students continue to occur."It just adds to the stress that has been piling on our students, frankly on our staff, for months and months and months. It makes teachers' jobs harder. It makes parents' jobs harder," she said.Leonard said he hopes the added stress of protests and disruptions doesn't take away from the "magic" of seeing students back in classrooms."Our kindergarteners were jumping up and down today," Leonard said."Yeah, with masks," he added. "But they're still happy to see their friends, they're still happy to eat the cafeteria food and they're excited to meet their new teachers."The pandemic hasn't taken that excitement away from kids — and he doesn't want politics to get in the way.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

More than 70% of reports to the FAA of unruly passengers this year were related to people failing to comply with mask mandates and causing a disruption as a result.Stefani Reynolds/Bloomberg via Getty Imageshide captionMask-wearing travelers head through Reagan National Airport in Arlington, Va., in May. More than 70% of reports to the FAA of unruly passengers this year were related to people failing to comply with mask mandates and causing a disruption as a result.Officials have already fined unruly airline passengers upward of $1 million in civil penalties this year, and many of those citations are related to aggressive refusal to wear masks as required byfederal rules.The Federal Aviation Administration announced in anews releaseThursday that since the beginning of the year, the agency has received around 3,889 reports of passengers behaving badly, and around 2,867 — more than 70% — were related to individuals failing to comply with mask mandates and causing a disruption as a result.During a flight from New York to California in May, an unnamed male passenger not only refused to wear a mask but then also allegedly started harassing other passengers: He threw a playing card at one person and began making "stabbing gestures" at others aboard the aircraft, according to the report. He then snorted what looked to be cocaine out of a plastic bag and continued to be unruly, prompting the crew members to arm themselves with mallets used for crushing ice and zip ties in the event they had to restrain him.Many of the 34 incidents described by the FAA are similar. In April, a woman flying from Massachusetts to Florida refused to wear a mask and was met by police at the gate after she shouted curses at the crew and punched another passenger in the face. A man flying to Kentucky from Florida the same month also refused to wear a mask and then urinated on the floor of the plane bathroom, letting urine leak into the kitchen area.The FAA has azero tolerance policyin regard to unruly behavior from customers. Fines for airline passenger misconduct cited in this week's report range from $7,500 to $45,000.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention beganrequiringface masks on all forms of public transport in January, and that mandate still includes indoor areas such as the interiors of planes and buses; outdoor transportation areas are, however, exempt.Despite the well-posted rules, as airlines began to see an influx of passengers this year as compared with 2020, they also saw a jump in the number ofdisruptive incidents,according to anFAA letterissued to airlines this month.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
The Associated PressNurses and doctors in the CoxHealth Emergency Department in Springfield, Mo., don personal protective equipment to treat patients with COVID-19 on July 16. Many overwhelmed hospitals, with no beds to offer, are sending critically ill COVID-19 patients to far-flung states for treatment.Nathan Papes/The Springfield News-Leader via APhide captionNurses and doctors in the CoxHealth Emergency Department in Springfield, Mo., don personal protective equipment to treat patients with COVID-19 on July 16. Many overwhelmed hospitals, with no beds to offer, are sending critically ill COVID-19 patients to far-flung states for treatment.MISSION, Kan. — Manyoverwhelmed hospitals, with no beds to offer, are putting critically ill COVID-19 patients on planes, helicopters and ambulances and sending them hundreds of miles to far-flung states for treatment.The surge in the delta variant of the virus, combined with low vaccination rates, has pushed hospitals to the brink in many states and resulted in a desperate scramble to find beds for patients.The issue is that large hospitals in urban areas already were running short of space and staff with non-COVID procedures like cancer biopsies and hip replacements when the summer surge started. That means they have very few free beds to offer to patients from small rural hospitals without ICUs or from medical centers in virus hotspots."Just imagine not having the support of your family near, to have that kind of anxiety if you have someone grow acutely ill," said Steve Edwards, CEO of CoxHealth, whose hospital in Springfield, Missouri, is treating patients from as far away as Alabama.Hospitals across the U.S. had more than 75,000 coronavirus patients as of last week, a dramatic increase from a few weeks ago but still well below the winter surge records. However, Florida, Arkansas, Oregon, Hawaii, Louisiana and Mississippi all have set pandemic records for COVID hospitalizations in recent weeks.Unlike the winter surge, hospitals this summer were already strained because emergency room volumes are back to pre-pandemic levels and patients are catching up on care they put off."We are seeing COVID patients and we are seeing car accidents and we are seeing kids come in with normal seasonal viral infections. And we are seeing normal life come into the emergency department along with the extra surge of COVID patients so it is causing that crisis," said Dr. Mark Rosenberg, president of the American College of Emergency Physicians.In Arizona, a special COVID-19 hotline is getting desperate calls from hospitals in Wyoming, Arkansas, Texas and California who are in search of bed space.Often, there are no takers."We just can't get them out," lamented Dennis Shelby, CEO of the 15-bed Wilson Medical Center in Neodesha, Kansas. Officials at the small hospital recently called 40 other facilities in multiple states seeking a bed for a COVID-19 patient, before finally finding one more than a day later about 220 miles (354.06 kilometers) away. Six of its seven patients have COVID-19, a pandemic high.In Kansas, sick COVID-19 patients at small rural hospitals are waiting an average of nearly 10 hours to be flown somewhere else, according to Motient, a company contracting with the state to help manage transfers.Dr. Richard Watson, founder of Motient, said Kansas patients are being sent as far away as Wisconsin Illinois, Colorado and Texas. Often, though, the rural hospitals just muddle through."That is just the worst day that you can have in the emergency room as a provider to be taking care of a patient that you are totally helpless to give them what you know they need," he said.He said the delayed transfers can have dire consequences for patients, especially those who urgently need to see specialists, often available only in bigger hospitals, for issues such as strokes or heart attacks."Imagine being with your grandma in the ER who is having a heart attack in western Kansas and you are saying, 'Why can't we find a bed for her?' We are watching this happen right in front of us. 'This is America. Why don't we have hospital bed for her.' Well here we are."In Washington state, the 25-bed Prosser Memorial Hospital doesn't have an intensive care unit, so it often sends critically ill patients elsewhere in the state. Hospital spokeswoman Shannon Hitchcock said Washington state hospitals are full, so Prosser patients are being sent as far away as eastern Idaho — 600 miles (965.61 kilometers) away.Luke Smith, director of the Arizona Surge Line, which coordinates COVID-19 patient transfers for Arizona patients and offers advice to out-of-state hospitals, said people arriving at emergency rooms "are more acutely ill than we have seen historically."Finding a hospital to take them is made more difficult by staffing shortages, after pandemic-fatigued doctors and nurses walked away."Most of them are saying it isn't that they don't have an open bed, it is that they don't have nursing staff to care for them," said Robin Allaman, chief nursing officer at the 25-bed Kearny County Hospital in tiny Lakin, Kansas. Officials there called hospitals in Nebraska, Oklahoma and New Mexico before one in Colorado Springs, Colorado, 200 miles (321.87 kilometers) away, agreed to take a recent patient.Allaman has no idea how many calls they made. "I think we quit counting," she said.High vaccination rates among the 65-plus age group group that filled beds early in the pandemic were supposed to protect hospitals from becoming overwhelmed again. But Justin Lessler, a professor of epidemiology at John Hopkins, said there hasn't been the kind of reduction in hospitalizations that officials had hoped for because the delta variant seems to be more severe, particularly in younger age groups, whose vaccination rates are lower.University of Iowa Healthcare in Iowa City has been getting calls from out-of-state hospitals seeking transfers, said Dr. Theresa Brennan, the hospital's chief medical officer. They turn down most of them "because we have beds full of our Iowans."Des Moines emergency medicine specialist Dr. Clint Hawthorne, like many doctors in Iowa, is concerned the situation could get worse after the Iowa State Fair, which is expected to draw 1 million people."How are we going to be able to handle that?" Hawthorne said. "There's not a good answer to that."Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

Most U.S. parents support mask mandates in schools, but are against vaccine requirements for eligible students, aKaiser Family Foundation surveyfinds.Opinions on masks and vaccinesAcross the country,some state leaders are demanding schools make face coverings optional. But more than 6 in 10 parents of school-age kids would like to see their children's school institute a mask mandate for unvaccinated students and staff.At the same time, 58% of parents are against schools requiring students ages 12-17 to get the vaccine, according to the KFF survey. Vaccination rates among teenagers remain low. Only about 1 in 3 children aged 12 to 15 are fully vaccinated,according to the latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Children under 12 are not yet approved to get vaccines.Read more about KFF's survey methodology here.What parents say about safety protocolsWith regards to COVID-19 testing in schools,a RAND Corporation surveyfinds that 51% of parents would take advantage of voluntary, free weekly testing, and 75% supported symptomatic testing.As the delta variant surges, most parents are still sending their kids back to school buildings, the RAND survey finds. But parents also want more information about the safety protocols in place at schools.According to the RAND survey, only 27% of parents said that they already knew the specific COVID-19 safety measures their child's school will use. Sixty percent of parents wanted to know more about which COVID-19 safety measures their child's school is enacting this fall.Read more about the methodology of the RAND survey, conducted with the Ipsos Knowledge Panel.This story originally appearedin the Morning Edition liveblog.Sneha Dey is the NPR education intern.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

Inslee announced that Washington state is expanding its vaccine mandate to include all public, charter and private school teachers and staff as well as those working at the state's colleges and universities.Ted S. Warren/APhide captionWashington Gov. Jay Inslee speaks at a news conference Wednesday at the state Capitol in Olympia. Inslee announced that Washington state is expanding its vaccine mandate to include all public, charter and private school teachers and staff as well as those working at the state's colleges and universities.All K-12 teachers and staff in Washington state, including public, private and charter school employees, could be fired if they aren't fully vaccinated against COVID-19 by Oct. 18.Gov. Jay Inslee issued the order Wednesday, which also applies to higher education institutions and most child care facilities in the state. Washington now has stricter and more decisive requirements than many other places in the United States. Mask mandates have proven divisivein Florida, Arizona and Texas, where school boards, parents and state governments are clashingover who gets to decide requirements."This is a serious issue. This is not some suggestion or whimsical idea we're floating. It is a job requirement," Inslee said.Washington's mandate is wide-ranging: It applies to anyone working in a school environment, including bus drivers, coaches and volunteers. If employees don't comply, they could be subject to dismissal. Exemptions for religious or medical reasons will be allowed, but "personal or philosophical exemptions" aren't acceptable, according to Inslee.Inslee announced the order likely affects about 118,000 workers in early-learning and child care programs, and about 90,000 employees in higher education institutions.The vaccine requirement doesn't apply to any students or to tribal schools, but Inslee also issued a new indoor mask requirement for all residents ages 5 and up, set to go into effect Monday.Inslee also highlighted the mandate requires full vaccination by Oct. 18, meaning school employees must get the second dose of the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, or the only dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, by Oct. 4 to be in compliance. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention considerspeople fully vaccinatedtwo weeks after they've received their final required dose of the COVID-19 vaccines.In Washington, the spread ofthe delta variant is driving up infection rates.As of Aug. 9, Washington averaged 2,665 cases per day, and Inslee reports more than 95% of COVID-related hospitalizations in the state are among unvaccinated people.This story first appeared on theMorning Editionlive blog.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Pien HuangSydney LupkinCarmel WrothFederal health officials are planning ahead to give booster shots in the fall to all U.S. adults, starting with those who were vaccinated early on, like the elderly, health care workers and first responders.Mario Tama/Getty Imageshide captionFederal health officials are planning ahead to give booster shots in the fall to all U.S. adults, starting with those who were vaccinated early on, like the elderly, health care workers and first responders.Health officials are preparing to roll out COVID-19 booster shots in the United States this September. According to aplan announcedAug. 18, all U.S. adults who received a two-dose vaccine would be eligible for an additional jab of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine eight months from when they got their second one."These booster shots are free," President Biden said in remarks Wednesday afternoon encouraging people in the U.S. to get the shots when it's their turn. "It will be easy. Just show your vaccination card, get a booster. ... It will make you safer and for longer. And it will help us end the pandemic faster."The timing of the move comes as something of a surprise. It was just a few days earlier that the FDA and CDC recommended a third shot of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccinefor a more limited population— people who are moderately to severely immunocompromised. The agencies made no mention then of imminently expanding this recommendation to the wider population.The new plan has been endorsed by both the Food and Drug Administration and an advisory committee of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The White House announcement raised numerous questions about how urgently Americans need boosters, how the rollout will go and more. Here's what we've learned so far:Federal health officials are seeing a trend. "The data consistently demonstrate a reduction of vaccine effectiveness against infection over time," the CDC's director, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, said at the White House briefing.The evidence presented at the briefing consists of several recent studies from health systems that have been collecting data on breakthrough infections. These include theNew York state health department, theMayo Clinicand theCDC's reporting system for nursing homesin the U.S., plusIsrael's ministry of healthabroad."We know that even highly effective vaccines become less effective over time," U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy said at the briefing. "It is now our clinical judgment that the time to lay out a plan for COVID-19 boosters is now."Importantly, the studies do not show any major increases in severe COVID-19 disease, hospitalization or death among fully vaccinated people. However, Walensky noted that data from Israel suggests "increased risk of severe disease amongst those vaccinated early."Dr. Anthony Fauci, Biden's chief medical adviser, also presented recent evidence showing that a third shot of either mRNA vaccine greatly increased antibodies against the virus that causes COVID-19.Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and top infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci were among other federal officials who have called for the U.S. to begin to roll out booster shots in September.J. Scott Applewhite/Pool photo/Getty Imageshide captionDr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and top infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci were among other federal officials who have called for the U.S. to begin to roll out booster shots in September.No, anyone who is fully vaccinated is still very well protected from getting seriously ill from COVID-19. Health officials were emphatic on this point.For now, anyone who has completed the two-dose mRNA vaccine course is considered fully vaccinated with "a high degree of protection against the worst outcomes of COVID-19," Murthy said.The rationale for laying the groundwork for boosters in the months ahead is to avert potential COVID-19 deaths in the future if vaccine-induced protection against serious illness wanes."We are concerned that the current strong protection against severe infection, hospitalization and death could decrease in the months ahead, especially among those who are at higher risk or who were vaccinated earlier," Walensky said. Booster shots, she said, would "maximize vaccine induced protection."J&J issueda press releaseon Aug.25 with preliminary results of a small study suggesting a second shot of the J&J vaccine could rapidly increase antibody levels in recipients.For now, though, booster shots are being advised for the mRNA vaccines only. A separate booster recommendation for individuals who received a Johnson & Johnson one-dose vaccine is expected soon, health officials say. The J&J vaccine was authorized for use in the U.S. a little later than the others — in March — and firm data on the safety and efficacy of an additional dose aren't yet available.Assuming the FDA and CDC give their blessing, all adults who got one of the mRNA vaccines will be eligible for boosters eight months after their second shot, starting Sept. 20. (As we mentioned above, the timeline and guidance from health officials on J&J boosters has yet to be determined, and may be different).Murthy notes that this plan automatically gives priority to high-risk groups."The plan ensures that people who were fully vaccinated earliest in the vaccination program will be eligible for a booster first. This includes our most vulnerable populations, like our health care providers, nursing home residents and other seniors," Murthy said.However, this is only true if a September launch date holds across the U.S. That would be eight months from when the highest priority groups got vaccinated originally. By later in the fall, there's a much wider pool of people who are eight months out from their initial shots.Giving out a third booster should go more smoothly than the initial bumpy vaccine rollout, says Claire Hannan, head of the Association of Immunization Managers, since the vaccine supply is bigger now and lessons have been learned about how to distribute it quickly. She expects there will be fewer mass vaccination sites and more people getting shots from their local pharmacies, workplaces and doctors.At Cleveland Clinic Community Care in Ohio, Dr.Michelle Medina, associate chief of clinical operations, says they plan to offer booster doses in the places where they currently give out COVID-19 vaccines, including at community health centers, outpatient pharmacies and specialty clinics.Yes. There's much to learn still about the vaccines and how they provide immunity to COVID-19.One big, open question is how long it takes for vaccine protection against severe disease and death to wane.If all goes to plan, booster shots will be available in the fall at locations such as pharmacies and hospitals.Mandel Ngan /AFP via Getty Imageshide captionIf all goes to plan, booster shots will be available in the fall at locations such as pharmacies and hospitals.Dr. Celine Gounder, an infectious disease specialist and epidemiologist at the NYU School of Medicine, says there's reason to believe that protection from severe disease lasts a good deal longer than protection from a mild-to-moderate respiratory infection."Injected vaccines like we have for COVID induce good systemic immunity, in the main organs of the body," she explains, meaning that even if people are getting breakthrough infections in their nose and upper respiratory tract, their lungs are probably still very capable of fighting off the virus.And while waning antibody levels in the blood are the main measure researchers are using at the moment, other elements of the immune system,such as memory B cells and T cells, are more difficult to measure but also play a crucial role in fighting off infections."The T cells generated by the vaccines are holding up amazingly well, with 99% of the hospitalizations being among unvaccinated adults in the US,"Dr. Monica Gandhi, an infectious disease physician at UCSF,wrote in a tweetWednesday. Estimates for the percent of unvaccinated people accounting for COVID-19 hospitalizations vary, but generally fallbetween 95% and 99%."Until you see hard outcomes — like a true increase in severe disease, hospitalization and death — it's unclear that what people are measuring with breakthrough infections is really predictive of waning immunity in the lungs when and where you need it," Gounder says.But health officials say they're not waiting to find out. And some scientists looking at the current trajectory think an increase in severe breakthrough hospitalizations and deaths is likely unless steps are taken soon."I think the growing evidence says that without boosters, that's probably what we'd be seeing by late fall," UCSF's Wachter wrote.Some health experts question whether giving boosters in the U.S. makes the best use of a limited global vaccine supply. They also question whether offering third doses to Americans will make a significant impact on stopping the pandemic."Vaccines need to be thought of as population-level interventions," says NYU School of Medicine's Gounder. She argues that getting a higher percentage of people vaccinated will protect a community more than giving already vaccinated people additional shots because it provides "community immunity," which reduces the amount of virus present.Meanwhile, other parts of the world are in dire need of COVID-19 vaccines. The World Health Organization hascriticized countries for giving boostershots when front-line health care workers in poor countries still haven't been vaccinated. "We're planning to hand out extra life jackets to people who already have life jackets and leaving other people to drown," Dr. Mike Ryan, head of WHO's health emergencies program, said at anews conference Wednesday.President Biden defended the decision to give boosters domestically as a "both, and" situation."We can take care of America and help the world at the same time," the president said in his remarks Wednesday. He pointed out that the U.S. has already donated 115 million dosesto efforts abroad— more than "every other country in the world combined" — and has pledged to send more than 600 million vaccines in total to other countries.The FDA could take multiple approaches to OK'ing the boosters, former agency officials say. It could first grant a full approval to Pfizer or Moderna for two doses (approval for Pfizer's was granted Aug. 23) and then issue an emergency use authorization for a booster dose, for instance. Or it could delay granting full approval and ultimately grant it later for two doses and a booster.Either way, if the FDA follows its usual protocol, the agency would first convene a meeting of its outside advisory committee, as it did when it originally granted emergency use authorization for each COVID-19 vaccine."We know in sort of the heat of the moment, and when we're all dealing with a real public health emergency, it becomes almost doubly important that we continually reassess and have the normal processes in place," saysDr. Jesse Goodman, a professor at Georgetown University's School of Medicine who used to be the chief scientist at FDA.Goodman says he worries that setting a start date for a booster program before the relevant data can be evaluated through the normal federal processes may put "the cart before the horse."The committee of outside experts typically hears presentations from the government, the product manufacturer and the public. Then, it often votes on whether the FDA should give a given product the green light. The agency doesn't have to follow the committee's advice, but it usually does.Norman Baylor,a former director of the Food and Drug Administration's Office of Vaccines Research and Review, says putting those committee meetings together in a month — as the administration's Sept. 20 booster start date would imply — is "pushing it."The agency's interim commissioner, Janet Woodcock,tweeted about the agency's booster plansAug. 18, though she didn't commit to convening the FDA's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee."FDA supports the administration's work to plan for the deployment of additional vaccine doses, or boosters, this fall," she wrote. "FDA will undertake an independent scientific evaluation of the safety and efficacy of boosters for each vaccine."After an FDA authorization, the CDC's independentvaccine advisory committeewould also weigh the evidence and make a recommendation.Yes, or at least it will. While the U.S. has plenty of vaccine doses that haven't yet been administered, it doesn't have enough in hand right now to give everyone a third shot immediately.But more doses are on the way.The United States struckdeals with Pfizerand Modernaearlier this summer to purchase another 400 million doses, which are expected to be delivered starting next month — whenthe Biden administration says it plans to begin offering boosters— through April of 2022.That should be enough to give all 258 million U.S. adults a third shot and to vaccinate any children under 12 who are likely to soon be eligible for vaccinations. The tens of millions of leftover shots from the first wave of purchase agreements will likely help prevent scarcity throughout the booster rollout.It's important to keep in mind that the administration is planning for a gradual rollout with the people who were originally vaccinated earliest going first."If the booster is based upon elapsed time since completion of the initial series, you wouldn't need all the doses to be on hand," says Hannan, of the Association of Immunization Managers. "So assessing the supply is a little complicated. But suffice to say, we have plenty of supply right now."Jeffrey Zients, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, says the Biden administration is "ready" for boosters."We have enough vaccine supply for every American," Zients says. "It will be just as easy and convenient to get a booster shot as it is to get a first shot today."NPR's Allison Aubrey and Rob Stein contributed to this report.
   
Michaeleen DoucleffPeople line up last week to receive COVID-19 vaccines in Kampala, Uganda, after weeks of no supply. In Uganda, only 2.2% of the population had received one dose of a vaccine as of Aug. 15.Hajarah Nalwadda/Xinhua News Agency via Getty Imageshide captionPeople line up last week to receive COVID-19 vaccines in Kampala, Uganda, after weeks of no supply. In Uganda, only 2.2% of the population had received one dose of a vaccine as of Aug. 15.In September, the U.S. will startofferinga third COVID-19 shot to all adults vaccinated with Pfizer and Moderna, even though these vaccines still offer high protection against hospitalization and death from the delta variant.Officials at the World Health Organization said Wednesday that it strongly opposes booster shots for all adults in rich countries because the boosters will not help slow down the pandemic. By diverting doses away from unvaccinated people, booster shots will help drive the emergence of more dangerous mutants,  the WHO doctors said."I'm afraid that this [booster recommendation] will only lead to more variants. ... And perhaps we're heading into an even more dire situation," WHO chief scientist Dr.Soumya Swaminathansaid.The problem with a call for boosters, she said, is that the virus is primarily circulating in unvaccinated people — not in the fully vaccinated.In defending the U.S. booster decision, Dr. Vivek Murthy, the surgeon general, said on Wednesday: "I do not accept the idea that we have to choose between America and the world. We clearly see our responsibility to both, and we believe we have to work on both fronts as we have been."Federal officials said they havesent more than 100 million doses overseasand plan to donate 500 million doses.The WHO estimates11 billion dosesare needed to bring the pandemic under control. Billions of people have not received even one dose of the vaccine,  said Dr.Bruce Aylward, senior adviser to the WHO director-general. In most low-income countries, less than 5% of the population is immunized. The unvaccinated include many health care workers and people at high risk of death and severe disease. In many middle-income countries, including most of Latin America, only about a third of the population has received shots.To stop the evolution of new variants, the world needs to focus on immunizing these populations before handing out extra protection to low-risk individuals in rich countries, Aylward said. "The problem is not enough people have been vaccinated. So our first priority is relatively simple: Get as many of the unvaccinated with two doses before you move beyond that."People wait Tuesday for a COVID-19 vaccine dose at a temporary vaccination center inside a school in Mumbai, India.Punit Paranjpe/AFP via Getty Imageshide captionPeople wait Tuesday for a COVID-19 vaccine dose at a temporary vaccination center inside a school in Mumbai, India.Rachel Silverman, a health researcher at the Center for Global Development, agrees. "I recognize it's a complicated policy decision for the Biden administration [on whether to offer boosters], and their primary responsibility is to American citizens," she said."On the other hand, if you're looking at how to get the world — and Americans — out of this crisis, just doubling down on vaccinating Americans with more and more boosters isn't going to work while there's widespread global circulation of the virus. Inevitably more variants will pop up, and one of them will inevitably be vaccine resistant."So recommending boosters is a bit of a myopic policy," Silverman added.But the solution isn't for individuals in wealthy countries to turn down boosters, she said. "There's not necessarily any direct benefit to someone like you or me refusing a vaccine," she said. "That doesn't mean it's actually going to go into someone else's arm. So I don't think it makes ethical sense as an individual to refuse a vaccine or a booster for that purpose. But certainly at a social level and a society-wide level, the ethics of making that prioritization decision are pretty tenuous."Any booster policy is questionable from an ethical standpoint, asserts WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. Offering booster shots will only exacerbate the massive vaccine inequity already present worldwide, Tedros said. "The divide between the haves and have-nots will only grow larger if manufacturers and leaders prioritize booster shots over supply to low- and middle-income countries," he said.Any available vaccine should first go to people around the world who are at high risk of hospitalization and deaths, said Dr.Michael Ryanof the WHO. "If we think about this in terms of an analogy, we're planning to hand out extra life jackets to people who already have life jackets, while we're leaving other people to drown without a single life jacket."Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

Australia's most populous state reported a record 633 new infections on Wednesday.Dan Himbrechts/APhide captionAustralian Defense Force personnel assist the public at a COVID-19 vaccination clinic in Sydney, Wednesday, Aug.18th. Australia's most populous state reported a record 633 new infections on Wednesday.SYDNEY — Australia's most populous state reported a record 633 new coronavirus infections on Wednesday as concerns grew about the delta variant's spread beyond Sydney.The previous record in New South Wales, which includes Sydney, was 466 on Saturday. Three people died on Tuesday, bringing the death toll from the outbreak first detected in Sydney in mid-June to 60."I can't express enough my level of concern at these rising numbers of cases," state Chief Health Officer Kerry Chant said. "I'm incredibly concerned."Infections were also reported in towns in the west, north and central regions of the state in recent days, Deputy Premier John Barilaro said. "The delta strain is really putting regional New South Wales on that knife edge," Barilaro said.Sydney has been in lockdown since June 26 and the entire state has been locked down since Saturday.Premier Gladys Berejiklian has rejected criticism that Sydney's lockdown restrictions needed to be tougher, describing the lockdown as "extremely harsh and extremely strict" and based on expert health advice.The national capital Canberra, which is surrounded by New South Wales, reported 22 new infections from the cluster that originated in Sydney. There have been 67 infections detected since the coronavirus was first discovered in Canberra on Thursday last week.In other developments in the Asia-Pacific region:— The first outbreak in six months in New Zealand has grown to seven people. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said Wednesday that number is expected to keep growing, especially after some of those infected spent time at a church, a school, a casino and a hospital. Ardern also announced people will be compelled to wear masks in supermarkets, gas stations and pharmacies during strict lockdowns. That came after the government on Tuesday imposed a strict lockdown of at least three days for the entire country and at least seven days in Auckland and Coromandel after identifying the first infection. Ardern said genome testing has confirmed that the outbreak is of the delta variant and originated from the outbreak in Sydney, although it's not yet clear how the virus breached New Zealand's border quarantine controls.— Beijing's top official is reiterating the need for strict anti-coronavirus measures at next year's Winter Olympics, now less than 200 days away. Cai Qi, the city's Communist Party chief and president of the organizing committee, was quoted as saying Beijing was intent on holding a safe Olympics. On a tour of venues, Cai emphasized strict measures to prevent the spread of the virus were needed but did not say whether general spectators would be permitted in the stands. The Tokyo Olympics were held without fans and with participants contained in a bubble with frequent testing and mask-wearing. State media report Olympics staff may get vaccine booster shots as a further safeguard.— The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies says Southeast Asia is battling the world's highest COVID-19 death toll, driven by the delta variant and unequal distribution of vaccines. Southeast Asia recorded 38,522 deaths from COVID-19 in the last two weeks, nearly twice as many as North America, it says, citing data from John Hopkins University. Seven of the top 10 countries where COVID-19 deaths have doubled the fastest are in Asia and the Pacific, with Vietnam, Fiji and Myanmar in the top five, according to Our World in Data. Its Asia Pacific director Alexander Matheou called Wednesday for richer countries to urgently share their excess vaccine doses with Southeast Asian nations to curb record surge in infections and deaths in the region. It said vaccine companies and governments also need to share technology and scale up production to help ramp up low vaccination rate in the region. While the United Kingdom, Canada and Spain have fully vaccinated over 60% of their population, it said Southeast Asian nations are falling far behind. Malaysia has fully vaccinated 34% of its population, Indonesia and Philippines close to 11% and Vietnam less than 2%. Matheou said each country must aim for mass vaccination rates of 70%-80% for the world to overcome the pandemic.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Will StoneAllison AubreyJoe PalcaOnly kids 12 and older are eligible — so far — to get vaccinated against COVID-19 in the U.S. But the shots could be available for younger children as soon as this fall, say researchers studying the vaccine in that age group.Chris O'Meara/APhide captionOnly kids 12 and older are eligible — so far — to get vaccinated against COVID-19 in the U.S. But the shots could be available for younger children as soon as this fall, say researchers studying the vaccine in that age group.With the U.S. in the grips of a frightening surge of coronavirus cases, many parents are understandably eager to know when the COVID-19 vaccine will finally be available for children under 12.This age group accounts for about50 million Americansand currently none of them qualify for a shot. But scientists are racing to figure out how one of the COVID-19 vaccines currently available for adults could be given to this age group.Pfizer and Moderna are both running large pediatric trials to study the effectiveness and safety of using their COVID-19 mRNA vaccines for children under 12.Here's what we can expect:What do we know from the vaccine studies of children under 12?Researchers have already shared some early findings about how a COVID-19 vaccine may be used in younger children.In the clinical trial for the Pfizer vaccine, the data collected shows that one-third of the adult dose is the optimal range for children younger than 12 and older than 5, saysDr. Flor Muñozat Texas Children's Hospital and Baylor College of Medicine, who is running the Pfizer study." 'Optimal' meaning the dose that will give you a similar immune response that will be protective, as we have seen with adolescents, with the minimum amount of side effects," she says.Muñoz and her team have enrolled children as young as 6 months and up through age 11. Her team is now in the next phase of the study, where they randomly assign children either to receive a vaccine or a placebo. Comparing a vaccinated group with a placebo group allows researchers to be confident that any benefit or risk during the study is truly related to the vaccine.The Pfizer study won't test to see whether the vaccine actually prevents children from getting sick. Instead, it will look at their blood to see if they are making the kinds of antibodies that have been shown to prevent disease. Studies of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine in adults have already shown that such antibodies indicate that someone is well-protected from becoming severely ill with COVID-19. Children will remain part of the study for two years so researchers can determine how long protection lasts, whether any rare, long-term health issues arise, and whether a booster is needed.Moderna is conducting asimilar pediatric studyof its COVID-19 vaccine. Children enrolling in the Moderna trial now have a 3 to 1 chance of getting the vaccine, because only 25% of the participants are in the placebo arm of the trial."We are testing different doses in the different age groups because younger children may not need the same dose as adults," says Dr. Jacqueline Miller, senior vice president at Moderna.When could shots be available?This depends on how quickly the studies collect the necessary data and what regulators at the Food and Drug Administration ultimately decide when they review the results.At the moment, it looks like the Pfizer vaccine will be the first shot available to children under 12. The vaccine-maker expects to have enough data by the end of September to support anemergency use authorizationfor its vaccine in children who are ages 5 to 11."We're hoping to have authorization — depending on both results and, of course, a few decisions — not too long after the school year starts," Dr. Phil Dormitzer, chief scientific officer for viral vaccines at Pfizer, told NPR recently.The data for children under 5 will be submitted shortly thereafter, a Pfizer spokesperson told NPR.Right now the other mRNA COVID-19 vaccine authorized for use in the U.S. — Moderna's — can be given to individuals who are 18 and older. Moderna says it expects to have enough data by the end of the year to seek authorization for a shot that can be given to children who are between the ages of 6 and 11.Moderna recently expanded the size of its trial and is now enrolling 12,000 children in an effort to increase the likelihood of detecting any rare, but serious adverse events. The Pfizer study currently plans to enroll up to 4,500 children, a company spokesperson told NPR."The safety profile so far is really comparable to the adults and, so far, no safety concerns," says Miller, referring to the Moderna vaccine. Data for children under 6 could be submitted to the FDA by "early next year," she says, "but that could be done more rapidly, depending on the rate of enrollment."Do we need to give children COVID-19 shots?Even with the emergence of new variants, the risk of severe illness from COVID-19 remains quite low for younger children compared to the adult population. But with so many infections each day in the U.S., a huge number of children are now being exposed to the virus and testing positive.More than 120,000 COVID-19 cases were reported among children between Aug. 5 and 12 — about 18% of the total weekly case count,according to the American Academy of Pediatrics."They do have a milder illness and lower likelihood of becoming infected," says Muñoz of Texas Children's Hospital. "But they can be infected. They can have severe illness and they can transmit the virus."And with such high numbers of infections nationally and no protection from a vaccine if they do get infected, more children are at risk of becoming one of the unlucky few who do get seriously ill or face long-term symptoms post-infection — a syndrome widely known as "long COVID."Dr. Paul Offit, a pediatric vaccine specialist at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, says a vaccine for younger children can't come soon enough, given the growth in cases.Only adding to the sense of urgency, hospitals in some parts of the country are admitting record numbers of children with COVID-19."We have more pediatric patients right now hospitalized with COVID than at any point prior in this pandemic," saysDr. LouAnn Woodward,who oversees the University of Mississippi Medical Center. "We are seeing a younger group of patients that are getting very sick with this."In aletter sent earlier this month, the head of the AAP urged the FDA to work "aggressively toward authorizing safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines for children under age 12 as soon as possible.""Simply stated, the delta variant has created a new and pressing risk to children and adolescents across this country, as it has also done for unvaccinated adults," wrote AAP presidentDr. Lee Savio Beers.Many parents do not want to risk their children's health, especially as the school year begins — a fact that's also reflected in the outpouring of interest from parents who are trying to enroll their kids in the clinical trials."I get multiple emails a day asking, and unfortunately we just have limited spots," says Baylor College of Medicine'sDr. Erin Nicholson, who is running a study of the Moderna vaccine in children under 12.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Bill ChappellRaiders fans do the wave during last weekend's preseason game in Las Vegas as a stadium sign reminds them to wear face masks. The team now says spectators will have to show proof of vaccination — and that no masks will be required for those who have been vaccinated.Ethan Miller/Getty Imageshide captionRaiders fans do the wave during last weekend's preseason game in Las Vegas as a stadium sign reminds them to wear face masks. The team now says spectators will have to show proof of vaccination — and that no masks will be required for those who have been vaccinated.When the Las Vegas Raiders kick off their NFL season next month, the team wants its home stadium to look as normal as possible, with stands full of fans. There's just one catch: To get in, every spectator will have to show proof they've gotten a COVID-19 vaccine. Anyone who hasn't can still enter — after they get a shot at Allegiant Stadium.Spectators will be required to show proof of their vaccination status on a mobile app with a "health pass" feature, the Raiders organizationsaid. If they do so, they can attend games without wearing a face mask.Fans who have opted to get a vaccine shot just before entering the stadium will have to wear a mask due to the lag time for the vaccines to take full effect.The Raiders' rules will be in effect for the team's first regular season home game — aMonday Night Footballmatchup with the Baltimore Ravens on Sept. 13.The Raiders unveiled their new policy late Monday after Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak announced a shift in hisrecent mask mandatethat opens the door for large-scale venues to hold mask-free events if all guests are vaccinated."This is cutting edge. There's no other venues in the country that are doing this,"Sisolak said, adding he hopes people feel reassured about attending an event where everyone is vaccinated.In late July, the Centers for Disease Control and Preventionupdated its guidanceon masks, stating: "If you are fully vaccinated, to maximize protection from the Delta variant and prevent possibly spreading it to others, wear a mask indoors in public if you are in an area of substantial or high transmission."The agency'swebsitecurrently lists Clark County, Nev. — home to Allegiant Stadium — as a place where the level of community transmission is high.The Raiders say their vaccine rule reflects Sisolak's latest policies on holding large events. The team was already requiring vaccines for all employees — a move it says was mirrored by stadium and concessions operators.The NFL says it's not considering a league-wide policy on vaccination, allowing teams to coordinate with local officials and health experts as well as follow federal guidelines."We are planning on full stadiums across the league this year but will remain flexible and adaptable as necessary," NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy told NPR. "Like last season, there may be different fan experiences, depending on the current situation in the local markets working in conjunction with public health authorities."The Raiders say their new rule makes them "the first team in the National Football League to announce a vaccine/no mask policy."But they're not the first team to announce an attendance policy linked to vaccines: Last week, the New Orleans Saintssaidthe Superdome will be open to spectators at full capacity for the first time in more than a year and a half.Citing new local policies fromNew Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell, the team added that fans who want to attend home games must show either proof of vaccination or the negative results of a coronavirus test taken within 72 hours before game time.The mayor's policy applies to all events at the Superdome, along with restaurants, bars and other congregating spots.Both Cantrell andLouisiana Gov. John Bel Edwardshave issued indoor mask mandates for everyone age 5 and older — another policy that the Saints and their fans will follow.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Suzette LohmeyerIs it OK to lie to get a booster shot? What about to get a vaccine for your not quite 12-year-old? Last week we publisheda post exploring the medical, practical and ethical consequences of lying.And we asked our readers to weigh in: Is it unethical to get a vaccine when the government says it's not your turn. Some of you gave us a "Heck yes, it's unethical!" Others are willing to break, or at least bend, the vaccine rules if you 1. Think those rules won't keep you or your loved ones healthy and/or 2. Believe unused vaccines will end up in a dumpster.Here's a sampling of what you had to say. Thanks to everyone who responded. Responses have been edited for length and clarity; initials rather than full names are used to protect the respondents from online harassment.L.M., TexasOur son turned 12 on August 12 – school starts on August 16. Earlier that week I took him to get his first dose of the Pfizer vaccine. He was basically days away from being 12 — and the governor is offering our kids no protections. He has backed us into a corner and we are taking matters into our own hands to protect our kids. I am not alone — I am in MANY mommy groups on Facebook, and this is happening everywhere, not just in Texas.When parents fear for their children's lives when they are headed back to school, you know there's a problem. I can rest somewhat easier knowing our son has at least some protection from his first vaccine dose, and he will wear a mask to school at least until he's a few weeks beyond his second dose.I have exactly zero regrets.J.B., PennsylvaniaI just found out two people I know lied about their vaccine status to get a booster. I was stunned they did this for many reasons but particularly the ethical and health reasons. Both are educated professionals and one of the two works in the health-care field. I felt they exhibited a selfish entitlement attitude by taking vaccines that could have gone to others. Also, the misrepresentation that it was their first vaccine taints the actual state department of health where they live and the CDC reporting of newly inoculated people.I blame in part this rush for a third vaccine on the Pfizer CEO. How self-serving of him when he made an announcement about the reasons why their company thought boosters were required, stepping ahead of WHO and CDC.B.Z., MarylandYou did not address the very real issue of immunocompromised people and their need for a third vaccine.After extensive collaboration with my medical team, they advised me to "do whatever I needed to do" to get a third vaccine as soon as possible and not to wait for FDA to make a decision. So I lied. I don't know who will pay the costs and frankly I don't care. I could not get into a study and we needed to try to get my antibody levels up. When vaccine doses are being discarded because there are not enough people who want them, I do not feel at all guilty for using one of them.As it turns out, the FDA announced a week after I got the 3rd vaccine that they would be making a decision 'within a week'. We'll see. I hope so.[Editor's note: On August 12, the FDA authorized athird COVID-19 dose for people with weakened immunity.]T.W., CaliforniaI'm on a temporary hiatus from New York City and have found myself in a very rural part of California where it is all big trucks, confederate flags and maskless militia supporters. Every pharmacy window has handwritten signs trying to encourage people to walk in off the street: "Extra vaccines! They are free!" It has been this way since the very beginning and it is clear that no one is taking them up on the offer.Is there any strategy coming down the pipeline to better allocate these shots, which are inevitably expiring, to the places that actually need and want them? Are these locations constantly getting a stream of usable vaccines only to trash them shortly after? I'd love to believe that by not using these unclaimed vaccines that they are actually being reallocated to people in need. What is the system for balancing out the national/global supply, and are we watching what could be extra protection for those who need it be washed down the drain?R.T., Fla.I got a Pfizer backup for my J&J and I didn't lie, but I may not have answered in the most direct way either."First shot?""Pfizer? Yes."I can't say that I feel bad about it. I live in a huge hotspot surrounded by every variant. Look at Sturgis, Lollapalooza, Rolling Loud and countless other large events. Look at the pastors and politicians, radio and TV personalities and social media influencers telling people to not trust or take the vaccine at all.What could possibly go wrong? It's like when Patrick had 10 hooks in his mouth and he tells SpongeBob, "I sense no danger here." Except it's tens of millions of Patricks. I can't help them.If I could have sent that dose to Africa, I would have. We all know that at the end of that day doses were thrown out. Odds are very high that all I took was something that was pre-garbage. Alabama has reportedly had to toss 65,000 doses. Don't try to judge me for protecting myself as I wade through a sea of idiots.Not up for discussionP.R., PhilippinesNo one should lie, period.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

A history of racial tension dating to the Civil War still stings in Cairo. And like many rural towns across the U.S., the community feels underappreciated and misunderstood.Lee Wright was hard at work, constructing a nail salon near the abandoned hospital in Cairo, Ill., when Jody Johnson stopped by to introduce himself on a recent afternoon.Johnson, who works for theUniversity of Illinois Extension program, chatted with Wright casually in the summertime heat. For Johnson, it was the first step to building trust in this town of fewer than 2,200 people as extension programs across the U.S. — long valued in rural communities for helping farmers and supporting 4-H clubs — expand their service to include educating the public about COVID-19 vaccines.Wright, 68, was unvaccinated and planned to remain so, even though he'd followed other public health guidelines during the pandemic. But when it came to getting the shots, he'd decided to leave his fate to his faith."Doctors are good. Don't get me wrong," Wright said. "But we got to have something that we can really depend on."Cairo residents Lee Wright and son Roman Wright take a break from construction work earlier this summer. Both decided not to get vaccinated. "I'm like my dad," Roman Wright says. "I was born and raised in church all my life. So I say we believe in God. I know my parents pray for me. We pray for each other, and we just believe in God."Cara Anthony/Kaiser Health Newshide captionCairo residents Lee Wright and son Roman Wright take a break from construction work earlier this summer. Both decided not to get vaccinated. "I'm like my dad," Roman Wright says. "I was born and raised in church all my life. So I say we believe in God. I know my parents pray for me. We pray for each other, and we just believe in God."Johnson didn't talk to Wright about the vaccines that day. He just listened. "No one wants to feel ashamed or belittled because they're not doing something," Johnson said later.Only16% of residentshere in Alexander County are fully vaccinated against COVID-19. That's the lowest rate in Illinois, according to the state health department, and case counts of coronavirus infections are rising. So theCooperative Extension System, which is tied to a network of land-grant universities, plans to spend the next two years talking about vaccines in this community and elsewhere across the United States. It may take that long or more to convince enough people to get vaccinated.The extension system has a long tradition of bringing research-based information to communities on a wide variety of topics, including water quality, food safetyand disaster preparedness. With its roots sunk deep in rural America, where vaccines have been slow to catch on, the systemis now using state and federal funding to pay forimmunization education effortstailored to specific communities.Already 4-H clubs have been making masks and face shields. In Illinois, the agency has aCOVID-19 resource guidefor families, business owners and farmers. The office covering the southern portion of the state is looking to hire someone in the community to help get out the word on why vaccinations matter. Johnson also wants to team up with local churches, civic groups and business owners to get the job done."This is not our first global pandemic," said Carissa Nelson, a spokesperson for 4-H programs in Illinois. The organization'sagents and club members nursed patientsduring the1918 flu pandemicthat devastated the world.This time around, the extension service's strategy could also help in these rural communities and the urban areas it serves. But local leaders say there's no quick solution for improving vaccination rates in Cairo or across the country; getting people vaccinated is a nuanced challenge in every community. In Cairo, a long history of racial tension dating to the Civil War still stings. Like many rural towns across the U.S., the community also feels underappreciated and misunderstood.Beverly Davis (left) shows off a catfish along the riverbank in Cairo. Davis fishes often for dinner and gives away much of her catch to the community. Ronnie Woods (right), a local pastor and retired schoolteacher, explains why he got vaccinated against COVID-19: "I have strong faith," Woods says. "And at my age, my risk factors, I just felt that God placed science there to help us."Cara Anthony/Kaiser Health Newshide captionBeverly Davis (left) shows off a catfish along the riverbank in Cairo.

"And at my age, my risk factors, I just felt that God placed science there to help us."Vaccine apathy is common here, where infection rates remained low until recently."We haven't had great turnouts," said Tyrone Coleman, president and co-founder of the Alexander and Pulaski NAACP chapter, which has helped organize vaccine clinics in Cairo.In June, he invited the health department to the city's Juneteenth celebration at St. Mary's Park. More than 300 people attended. But the event's pop-up clinic hosted by the state didn't have many seeking vaccinations during its six hours of operation."We only had two," Coleman said.More than 15,000 people lived in Cairo in the early 20th century, helping it earn the nicknames "Little Chicago" and "the Gateway to the South." Old factories, antebellum homes, an ornate library and a vacant hospital remain as reminders of the city's majestic past. The library prominently displays the work of Samuel Clemens, the American writer best known as Mark Twain. After traveling through Cairo, Twain wrote about the city in his 1884 novel,The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.In the novel, Cairo represents freedom and the chance for a better life.But the hospitalshut downin 1987. The only grocery store in town closed years ago; public housing was torn down in recent years, and the only nursing home closed during the pandemic, forcing residents to find a new place to live without much notice. On top of all that, flooding has threatened to wipe the city out more than once.Today, fewer than2,200 people, the majority of them Black, live here. And locals say the population has continued to drop with all the closures. The city is often mislabeled by the press and travel guides asabandoned."Cairo is not a ghost town," said Ronnie Woods, a local pastor and retired schoolteacher. "It's not dead at all."Tourists still stop by to see the confluence of the Mississippi and Ohio rivers. But they don't typically see the rocky riverbank where residents fish for their dinner. Beverly Davis, 60, heads there often with rod in hand and gives much of her catch away to other members of the community. The scenic waterfront, though, is carpeted with driftwood and dead fish that washed ashore."I guess it's meant to be like this," Davis said, standing on the riverbanks among the fish carcasses. " 'Cause if not, it would be better."But many residents continue to believe their city will return to its past glory. "The world hears that this is a negative part of the country, and it's not," Johnson said. "We've got too many good things and people here."On this day, the only outdoor basketball court in the city, anchored by a single hoop, was busy in a rural community fighting to stay alive long before the pandemic hit. The men on the court didn't seem worried about catching COVID-19."I haven't had COVID, so I feel like I don't need to get vaccinated right now," Jeffery DeWitt, 24, said. "I'll just take it as it goes."Wright's son, Roman Wright, 36, said much the same thing while helping his dad build the nail salon across town. He works for the prison system. One of its facilities nearby reported COVID-19 cases, but Wright hadn't contracted the disease.Like his father, he said he didn't plan on getting the shots."I'm like my dad," Roman Wright said. "I was born and raised in church all my life. So I say we believe in God. I know my parents pray for me. We pray for each other, and we just believe in God."Woods, the pastor, has a different point of view. He keeps his vaccination card in a plastic sheath and carries it with him wherever he goes."I have strong faith," Woods, 66, said. "And at my age, my risk factors, I just felt that God placed science there to help us."But Woods said it's going to take work to persuade others in Cairo to get vaccinated, even if they know someone who died of COVID-19. Aprominent doctorwas among the dead in the community. "It's going to take more than explaining," he said. "It is going to take a cultural shift because people are just not trusting."University of Illinois Extension director Jody Johnson (right) exchanges contact information with Lee Wright (left) and son Roman Wright.

As a 51-year-old white man who grew up in a predominantly white community 45 miles outside of Cairo, he recognizes that local residents would be more likely to share their thoughts with someone who lives here. Plus, he spends most of his time talking with community leaders and public officials. He is searching for someone who will spend time with locals who don't hold titles and positions."Everybody doesn't think like me," Johnson said.

Dave MistichA fleet of Broward County School Buses are parked in a lot on July 21, 2020, in Pembroke Pines, Fla. Three county educators have died of complications from the coronavirus.Johnny Louis/Getty Imageshide captionA fleet of Broward County School Buses are parked in a lot on July 21, 2020, in Pembroke Pines, Fla. Three county educators have died of complications from the coronavirus.Less than a week before schools are set to reopen in Florida's Broward County, local union officials say three educators have died of complications from the coronavirus. The deaths were all recorded within a 24-hour span, according to union officials representing employees of the local school district.Broward Teachers Union President Anna Fusco said the start of the new school year has been a mix of emotions as the first day approaches."The whole excitement of going back was just running through our teachers when we went back to work on Wednesday," Fusco told NPR by phone Saturday. "And then the sense of anxiety that our governor's interfering with the safety protocols and wanting to block the mask mandate because they know it's an extra layer of protection. And then the deaths that were reported."Fusco said 48-year-old Pinewood Elementary teacher and union steward Janice Wright, 49-year-old Dillard Elementary teacher Katina Jones and 49-year-old teaching assistant Yolonda Hudson-Williams, also of Dillard Elementary, were the educators who lost their lives to COVID-19 this past week.None of them were vaccinated, Fusco said.Schools in Broward County are expected to reopen for the new academic year on Wednesday.In an act of defiance aimed at Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, the Broward County School Board voted 8-1 Tuesday to make wearing masks in all district schools and facilities mandatory for students, staff, and visitors, member stationWLRN reported.The board allowed for parents to have their children "opt out" of wearing a mask.DeSantishas threatened to withhold payfrom superintendents and board members who buck an executive order banning mask mandates in schools."He's just pushing his political agenda to cater to the same constituents that were pro-Donald Trump," Fusco said of the governor. "I think because they scream louder, [he thinks] there must be more of them than the constituents that are taking this virus really [seriously] and want to be safe and secure."Cases of the coronavirus have spiked in Florida in recent weeks, spurred on by thehighly contagious delta variant.Between Aug. 6 and Aug. 12 state officials recorded 151,415 new cases of the virus, 14,675 of which were in Broward County.According todata published Fridayby the Florida Department of Health, 74% of Broward County's population of 12-year-olds and older has been fully vaccinated — well above the overall total for the state, which stands at 65%.Fusco said she is currently "torn" over talks of mandating vaccinations, although she said she may change her mind once the Food & Drug Administration fully authorizes the vaccines."I don't think that we should have that position of mandating it right now — especially not me, the union president of 18,000 bargaining unit members," she said. "But a mask mandate? You're not injecting anything in your body. It's just a covering."In neighboring Palm Beach County, more than 1,000 studentswere quarantinedthis week following an outbreak of the virus upon the opening of schools there.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Joe NeelThe CDC recommended that people with weakened immune systems get a third shot of either the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccine. The move follows the FDA's authorization of such use a day earlier.Patrick T. Fallon/AFP via Getty Imageshide captionThe CDC recommended that people with weakened immune systems get a third shot of either the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccine. The move follows the FDA's authorization of such use a day earlier.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is officially recommending that people with weakened immune systems get a third shot of either the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccine.It comes hours after a unanimous vote by a panel of advisers Friday to recommend the guidance and less than 24 hours after theFood and Drug Administrationauthorized such use.Providers generally wait for a CDC recommendation on vaccine use, even if the FDA has approved or authorized a vaccine.Immunocompromised people make up about 2.7% of U.S. adults, or around 7 million people. They are more likely to get severely ill from COVID-19, and they are at higher risk for prolonged coronavirus infection and transmission. They also have a lower antibody response to the initial vaccine regimen and are more likely to transmit the virus to household contacts, according to studies that CDC officials presented to the advisory committee.People with conditions that weaken the immune system or who are taking treatments that suppress immunity are also far more likely to have breakthrough infection than people in more normal health. One U.S. study shows 40% to 44% of hospitalized breakthrough cases are in immunocompromised people.Studies have also shown the vaccine is less effective in these people, ranging from 59% to 72%. That compares with 90% to 94% among people without serious immune deficiencies. People who've received a solid organ transplant have the lowest immunity after the standard vaccine regimen.The agency says people withthe following conditionsshould take a third dose:The recommendation is limited to adults 18 and older for the Moderna vaccine because that vaccine has not been authorized for adolescents yet. That authorization is expected from the FDA in the next few weeks. The Pfizer vaccine is authorized for adolescents 12 and older and adults.People with other conditions are not being advised to get an additional dose at this point. "This would not include long-term care facility residents, persons with diabetes, persons with heart disease — those types of chronic medical conditions are not the intent here," the CDC's Dr. Amanda Cohn said. Additional studies of how long immunity lasts in healthy people are underway and will determine the timing of any additional doses for the general population, both FDA and CDC officials said.The CDC said attempts should be made to match the additional dose type to the one used in the original set of shots someone receives. But if that is not feasible, an additional dose with the other vaccine is permitted. The additional dose should be administered at least 28 days after completion of the primary vaccine series, according to the data reviewed by the committee.On Thursday, the FDA said that the agency was unable to extend the authorization for an additional dose to the Johnson & Johnson vaccine due to insufficient data. Representatives of both agencies said they are "actively engaged" to determine the best course of action for recipients of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.In a presentation to the committee, the CDC's Dr. Kathleen Dooling said immunocompromised people, including those who receive an additional dose, should continue to follow prevention measures, including wearing a mask, staying 6 feet apart from others they don't live with and avoiding crowds and poorly ventilated indoor spaces until their health care provider advises otherwise.Close contacts of immunocompromised people should be strongly encouraged to be vaccinated against COVID-19, she said.Separately, the CDC said about 1.1 million people who do not necessarily have immune system dysfunction have already received one or more additional doses of the Moderna or Pfizer vaccines. About 91,000 have received one or more additional doses of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.The CDC's recommendation comes during an intense new surge driven by the delta variant. Since July 1, the number of confirmed cases has gone up 700%, according to the CDC.According to the agency, emerging experimental and observational data in adults suggest that an additional COVID-19 vaccine dose with the Moderna or Pfizer vaccine enhances antibody response and increases the proportion of immunocompromised patients who respond to the vaccine.In her review of the evidence, Dooling said that small studies of an additional dose of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine found no serious adverse events. However, the standard dose regimen of these vaccines has been associated with rare but serious adverse events, including anaphylaxis and myocarditis and pericarditis in young adults. The impact of immunocompromising conditions on these rare events is unknown, she said.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Adela WuA mask is still an important protective measure for both the unvaccinated and the vaccinated. A new study looks at the best ways to encourage folks to mask up.Ian Morton/NPRhide captionA mask is still an important protective measure for both the unvaccinated and the vaccinated. A new study looks at the best ways to encourage folks to mask up.How do you get someone to wear a mask?The question is back on many people's minds as cases of the delta variant rise among unvaccinated and vaccinated people and pressures mount to mask up.Despite mask mandates, social pressure and even rewards — givinggift cardsto kids who wear their masks properly, for example — the country remains divided on mask-wearing. President Biden condemned anti-masking behavior at a press conference Thursday at the White House.But some countries have been making progress in getting people to mask up. Researchers from Stanford, Yale, the Bangladeshi nonprofit GreenVoice and the research groupInnovations for Poverty Action, among others, areconducting an ongoing studyin 600 villages in Bangladesh to figure out the most effective behavior-changing techniques, with the goal of sharing them across the globe.The researchers say these methods could be especially helpful in reducing COVID-19 transmission in low-income countries where the supply of vaccines is limited. While the measures may not work in every country, there may be helpful takeaways — including for countries such as the U.S., where masking has become politicized.Mushfiq Mobarak, a professor of economics at Yale University, says the experiment was inspired by a concerning observation he made early in the pandemic. While working in his native Bangladesh in May 2020, he noticed that despite government masking mandates and fines for the unmasked, no one around him was wearing a face covering.Bangladeshis line up (and mask up) last week for the coronavirus vaccine.Munir Uz Zaman/AFP via Getty Imageshide captionBangladeshis line up (and mask up) last week for the coronavirus vaccine.Mobarak was alarmed — masks are the best chance for Bangladeshis to stop the spread of the coronavirus. Bangladesh is one of the most densely populated countries in the world, making it nearly impossible to distance in public spaces. And a weak health care system means that people sick with COVID-19 may not immediately get the treatment they need, says Lawrence Gostin, professor of global health law at Georgetown University, who was not involved in the research.So Mobarak set out on a quest to find out how to get Bangladeshis to wear masks.Mobarak and a group of researchers teamed up with the Bangladesh Medical Research Council and the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare to design and conduct a program that would evaluate different strategies to increase mask-wearing.They'd do this by testing it out in the real world — with 341,830 people in 600 villages, some in rural parts of Bangladesh and some just outside big cities. The experiment rolled out in waves from November to January.The researchers randomly chose 300 villages to receive mask interventions for eightweeks. Another 300 villages received no intervention at all — they'd be the comparison group.People who lived in the 300 intervention villages were subjected to a set of core practices during the testing period, inspired by "the best ideas in social, economics, psychology, marketing literature," Mobarak says.The strategies essentially centered on free face coverings and reminders. Each household got three free masks, but people could also get free masks at mosques or markets. People were shown videos of notable Bangladeshis, such as national cricket star Shakib Al Hasan or Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, discussing how and when to wear the face coverings. Local imams at Friday prayers discussed the importance of wearing masks using a script from the researchers. And program volunteers routinely reminded people to mask up at outdoor public spaces such as marketplaces several days a week.In addition to the core interventions, the researchers wanted to test out a few more behavioral nudges.To evaluate incentives, the researchers divided the test group into three. One set of villages could get $190 to purchase an item for the whole community if at least 75% of its adult residents were still masking up eight weeks after the start of the experiment.Another tactic focused on text messages. Two-thirds of the group received text messages twice a week during the intervention period with reminders to mask up.Finally, the researchers tested out style. One-third of the test group received a cloth mask in various colors, including one printed with the Bangladeshi flag, instead of a blue or green surgical mask.After the eight-week period of interventions was over, researchers began the second phase of the experiment. They observed people going about their business in markets, mosques and other public spaces. For 10 weeks, they counted how many people in the villages were wearing masks.Mobarak and his team were surprised by what they found. The core interventions — which included the free masks and frequent reminders — more than tripled mask use, from 13% in the comparison villages to 42% in the treatment villages.Furthermore, people kept wearing masks after the volunteer promoters of masks left the villages. "Even after 10 weeks, after we finished everything, the mask-wearing persisted. That's what got us excited," Mobarak says.None of the extra nudges or incentives were helpful, saysLaura Kwong, assistant professor in environmental health sciences at University of California, Berkeley, who worked on the study.The text messages weren't effective because people just got too many texts, she says. And the money reward didn't work because the goal — getting 75% of the village to wear masks — was too high.Even the failed interventions are still good lessons, Kwong says. "The benefit of this study is that we learned a lot about what you don't need to do to make [masking] effective."Individual color preferences for face coverings, however, did seem to make an impact. Those who got a blue surgical mask were 2.9% more likely to wear it than those who received green ones, Mobarak says. And in villages where cloth masks were distributed, people were 5.8% more likely to wear a mask if they received a violet one than a red one.The next phase of the study will focus on measuring whether the mask interventions helped lower rates of COVID-19 in the villages, Mobarak says.For now, the researchers have turned the best practices from their experimentinto a modelcalled NORM, short for:The international development groupBRACand other partners are now scaling up the NORM model to more than 100 million people across Bangladesh, India, Mexico, Nepal, Pakistan and Uruguay. The program began in June.Georgetown'sGostinsays masking interventions could be tremendously helpful in these low-resource settings. "[Masks are] never going to prevent a raging epidemic, but it might flatten the curve to save the health system," he says. "You're using masking to buy precious time — until they get more vaccines."Can NORM get more Americans to mask up, too?"I don't think it would have the same dramatic effect in the U.S." saysJay Van Bavel, associate professor of psychology at New York University, who studies the social science of human behavior.Face masks, along with vaccines, have been so politicized in the United States that they've become a symbol of identity, Van Bavel says.Surveys conducted early in the pandemichave shown that Democrats are more likely to wear masks than Republicans — and that behavior has stuck, he says. People continue to "refuse to wear masks on ideological grounds," he adds.But some of the methods in the NORM model may be marginally helpful, Van Bavel says — offering free masks in convenient locations, for example. "I've often said there should be a box of free masks at the front of grocery stores, because some people just forget them or they're not at hand or they're financially strapped to keep replacing them," he says.And role models can encourage health behaviors. Van Bavelcites a paperpublished in the journalPNASin August. "They found that if [former President Donald] Trump had endorsed the vaccine [after he got vaccinated], that would've nudged more Republicans to get vaccinated. But he didn't come out and advocate. He didn't do a public video."If all else fails, you can try to legislate behavior, Van Bavel says. For example, "universities and companies are now requiring everyone to get vaccinated" to be allowed to come to school or work. People may not like it — this week, protesters rallied against a school masking mandate in Tennessee — but "a lot of [employers and teachers] are at their wits' end."Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Joe HernandezFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis, here at a news conference Tuesday, has announced plans for a state-run mobile unit providing monoclonal antibody treatments.Marta Lavandier/APhide captionFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis, here at a news conference Tuesday, has announced plans for a state-run mobile unit providing monoclonal antibody treatments.Florida is rolling out a mobile unit to administer monoclonal antibody treatments to coronavirus patients,Gov. Ron DeSantis announced.Officials are expanding the availabilityof the treatments, which have emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration, asa record numberof new coronavirus infectionsis straining Florida's health care system."There's clear benefits to this early treatment for keeping people out of the hospital and reducing mortality," DeSantis said during a Thursday news conference.Monoclonal antibodies — which hold the coronavirus in check by mimicking the body's natural immune defenses — can be used totreat people with mild to moderate COVID-19 who are 12 years of age or older. But the treatment doesn't work for those who've already developed more severe symptoms or are hospitalized.Both vaccinated and unvaccinated people who are infected can receive the treatments, officials said.Former President Donald Trump received Regeneron's monoclonal antibody treatment when he contracted coronavirus last fall.But some states have struggled to make the treatment widely available since it is administered by an intravenous infusion that can take up to an hour and requires medical staff that may already be overworked.While announcing the new rollout, DeSantis noted that monoclonal antibody treatments may not be as well-known in the battle against COVID-19 because they received emergency authorization around the same time that the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines also did.Florida is looking to offer monoclonal antibody treatments atother locations throughout the state, and it will send "strike teams" into long-term care facilities to offer the treatment to older residents and others where they live.The state has become a hot spot for new COVID-19 cases in recent weeks as the highly contagious delta variant has caused transmission rates to explode.Still, DeSantis has resisted forcing students, many of whom are under age 12 and ineligible for the vaccine, to wear masks during the upcoming school year. He has threatened towithhold fundingfrom any school districts that don't let parents choose whether their children wear masks, though several counties have ignored the threat and kept their mask mandates or imposed new requirements.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

Puskar/APhide captionOne year after the Little League World Series was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the upcoming series will be played without spectators from the general public. Here, players are seen on the field at Lamade Stadium in South Williamsport, Pa., during the tournament's 2019 edition.Young baseball players are competing for a spot in the Little League World Series. But when the popular tournament begins next week, the general public won't be invited due to the spike in COVID-19 cases driven bythe delta variant.Last year's Little League tournament was canceled outright for thefirst time in its history. The decision to hold this year's tournament with only a very limited number of spectators is "disappointing," officials said, but they add that the move is required by the new coronavirus wave.Organizers had planned to distribute some 3,000 tickets for each day of the tournament, which is traditionally played in South Williamsport, Pa. Butthey've now pulled that plan, citing the need to protect players and their families, along with coaches and volunteers.The Little League World Series is slated to run fromAug. 19-29and will feature the  top two teams from each of eight U.S. regional tournaments.In-person spectators will be limited to "the family and friends of our 16 participating teams and our highest-level volunteers and supporters," said Steve Keener, Little League International's president and CEO.Teams that play in the tournament will each get 250 passes for their friends and family, organizers say."All spectators, regardless of vaccination status, will also be strongly encouraged to wear a face mask when on the complex, especially while in any indoor facility during their visit," the league said.Little League organizers decided in May to move ahead with holding this summer's baseball and softball tournaments. The softball tournament isalready underwayin Greenville, N.C."As this virus evolves, we must continue to stay vigilant and do everything we can to reduce exposure of COVID-19 to our players and participants," said Dr. Daniel Lueders, a physician who leads the Little League's pandemic advisory commission."Reducing fans in Williamsport is a disappointing but necessary measure we must make to support that effort at this time," Lueders said.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Will StoneJane GreenhalghThe FDA announced that it has authorized a third COVID-19 vaccine dose for people with weakened immune systems.Joe Raedle/Getty Imageshide captionThe FDA announced that it has authorized a third COVID-19 vaccine dose for people with weakened immune systems.The Food and Drug Administration is authorizing an additional dose of a COVID-19 vaccine for certain people with weakened immune systems caused either by disease, medical treatments or organ transplants.The move comes after studies have shown these people may not have sufficient immunity to head off the more serious complications of COVID-19 after the standard vaccine regimen.Late Thursday night,the FDA amended the emergency use authorizationsfor both the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines to allow for an additional dose for certain immunocompromised people, specifically, solid organ transplant recipients or those who are diagnosed with conditions that are considered to have an equivalent level of immunocompromise. The CDC estimates the population to be less than 3% of adults."The country has entered yet another wave of the COVID-19 pandemic," said acting FDA Commissioner Dr. Janet Woodcock, noting that immunocompromised people are particularly at risk for severe disease. "After a thorough review of the available data, the FDA determined that this small, vulnerable group may benefit from a third dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna Vaccines," Woodcock said.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is convening a meeting of its immunization advisory committee Friday to consider the scientific evidence supporting the FDA's action and whether to recommend the additional dose for these people. The committee will also evaluate more broadly the need for a booster for people who are not immunocompromised.Some countries have already started administering an additional dose to seniors, based on studies showing a decline in immunity over time. The committee is not scheduled to take any action on the broader question of boosters for the general population.At a White House briefing Thursday, Dr. Anthony Fauci said there is a need for boosters for these people whose immune systems do not produce a strong response to the regular vaccine regimen. And while he believes that boosters will ultimately be needed for the general population, that time has not arrived."We believe sooner or later you will need a booster for durability of protection," he said. "But right at this moment, apart from the immunocompromised ... we do not believe that others, elderly or nonelderly, who are not immunocompromised need [another dose of] vaccine right at this moment."He emphasized that the government was preparing for that need and would be "ready to do that and do it expeditiously." At the same time, with millions of people around the globe still waiting for their first dose, the World Health Organization is calling for a moratorium on booster shots to help make vaccine distribution more equitable.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
The Associated PressMayor London Breed walks in San Francisco with California Gov. Gavin Newsom in June.Eric Risberg/APhide captionMayor London Breed walks in San Francisco with California Gov. Gavin Newsom in June.SAN FRANCISCO — Worried that thehighly contagious delta variantof the coronavirus could derail San Francisco's economic rebound, Mayor London BreedannouncedThursday that the city will require proof of full vaccination at indoor restaurants, bars, gyms and entertainment venuesto help keep businesses open."This is to protect kids, is to protect those who can't get vaccinated, is to make sure that we don't go backwards, is to make sure that I never have to get up in front of you and say, 'I'm sorry, I know we just reopened and now the city is closed again because we are seeing too many people die,' " Breed said.The mandate will be more stringent thanthe one announced by New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio last week. San Francisco will require proof of full COVID-19 vaccination for all customers and staff, while New York mandated proof of at least one dose for indoor activities.It will take effect Aug. 20, but businesses will have two more months to verify employees' vaccination status "to preserve jobs while giving time for compliance." The mandate does not apply to people ineligible for vaccines, including children under 12.The Chase Center, home to the Golden State Warriors basketball team, reacted to the news by asking ticket holders to a Sept. 15 rock concert to show proof of vaccination. AEG Presents, the giant concert and live event promoter, also announced Thursday it will require proof of vaccination for COVID-19 to attend its shows and festivals starting Oct. 1.In addition to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention paper cards that people get when they are vaccinated, California has established an online record with a bar code that vaccinated people can use to prove their status. Breed said a photo of the CDC card will suffice, and that it will be up to businesses to enforce the requirement. Proof of vaccination issued by foreign governments is also acceptable.The goal is to raise the vaccination rate in a city where 78% of the eligible population already is fully vaccinated, she said. San Francisco was among the first to ban large gatherings and close schools at the beginning of the pandemic and has been at the forefront of other COVID-19 restrictions, including requiring all city employees to be vaccinated without the option of testing regularly.Los Angeles is considering a similar vaccine requirement, with people needing at least one dose before going to indoor restaurants, bars, gyms, movie theaters and other venues. Leaders there voted Wednesday to direct city attorneys to work out the details.Also Wednesday, Gov. Gavin Newsom said all employees at public and private schools in California will have to show proof of vaccination or face weekly testing.Diners eat at the Buena Vista Cafe amid the coronavirus outbreak in San Francisco in November.

The city will require proof of full vaccination against COVID-19 to enter places such as restaurants.Breed announced the mandate Thursday at the historic Vesuvio Cafe in North Beach, a favorite haunt of the beat poets. The cafe is among many San Francisco businesses that have already been requiring proof of vaccination indoors."Most people were really happy that we had started the policy. It took patience on everyone's part. So, the people who were impatient or didn't like the policy would just leave," Vesuvio co-owner Janet Clyde said."Having the weight of the government behind you, the science, the health department" makes it easier to enforce, she said.Bar owners, already struggling to find enough staff, want to protect their employees and stay open, said Ben Bleiman, president of the San Francisco Bar Owner Alliance.He said he was forced to close his bar one night after the bartender got infected at another job.A group representing nearly 100 fitness studios said the mandate would help avoid the capacity limits or another potential shutdown that hurt their businesses last year."We support the city's vaccine requirement for indoor fitness as it provides our clients with one more level of assurance that they can experience the mental and physical benefits of fitness in a safe, healthy environment," said Dave Karraker, a board member of the San Francisco Independent Fitness Studio Coalition.Thursday's order also extends the vaccination requirement for certain health care providers, including employees at adult day care centers, residential care facilities, dental offices, home health aides and pharmacists, who are not included in the state health order on vaccinations.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
The Associated PressJen Ho Lee, a 76-year-old South Korean immigrant, poses in her apartment in Los Angeles on March 31 with a sign from a recent rally against anti-Asian hate crimes.Jae C. Hong/APhide captionJen Ho Lee, a 76-year-old South Korean immigrant, poses in her apartment in Los Angeles on March 31 with a sign from a recent rally against anti-Asian hate crimes.The frequency of anti-Asian incidents — from taunts to outright assaults — reported in the United States so far this year seems poised to surpass last year despite months of political and social activism, according to a new report released Thursday.Stop AAPI Hate, a national coalition that became the authority on gathering data on racially motivated attacks related to the pandemic, received 9,081 incident reports between March 19, 2020, and this June. Of those, 4,548 occurred last year, and 4,533 this year. Since the coronavirus was first reported in China, people of Asian and Pacific Islander descent have been treated as scapegoats solely based on their race.Lawmakers, activists and community groups have pushed back against the wave of attacks. There have been countless social media campaigns, bystander training sessions and public rallies. In May, President Joe Bidensigned the bipartisan COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act, expediting Justice Department reviews of anti-Asian hate crimes and making available federal grants. Those supporters should not feel discouraged because the data hasn't shifted much, Stop AAPI Hate leaders said."When you encourage hate, it's not like a genie in a bottle where you can pull it out and push it back in whenever you want," said Manjusha Kulkarni, co-founder of Stop AAPI Hate and executive director of the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council. "There's too much perpetuating these belief systems to make them go away."Several factors contributed to the data, from an increase in incidents to a greater desire to report, according to Kulkarni. As the economy opened up more in the past few months, it meant more public interactions and opportunities to attack, she said. Also, a bump in reporting typically occurs after a high-profile incident like the March 16 Atlanta-area spa shootings that left six Asian women dead."There, too, is where we saw some that were incidents that had taken place weeks or months before, but they just were either not aware of our reporting center or didn't take the time to report," Kulkarni said.The reports aggregated by Stop AAPI Hate are from the victims themselves or someone reporting on their behalf, like an adult child. Overall, the report found verbal harassment and shunning — interactions that don't qualify legally as hate crimes — make up the two largest shares of total incidents. Physical assaults made up the third. But their percentage of the incidents this year increased from last year — 16.6% compared to 10.8%.More than 63% of the incidents were submitted by women. Roughly 31% took place on public streets, and 30% at businesses.Many Asian Americans and others blame former President Donald Trump for ratcheting up the danger by talking about the virus in racially charged terms. While Biden has demonstrated allyship, there is concern that a U.S. investigation into the origins of COVID-19  could lead to more hostility and treatment of Asian Americans as enemy foreigners."We understand that other nation-states are competitors to the United States, and a number of them do have authoritarian regimes," Kulkarni said. "But the ways in which we talk about the people and the ways in which blame is assigned somehow looks different for communities of color than it does for, say, the Russian government or the German government."Many of the headline-making attacks over the past year and a half have been against elderly Asian people on both coasts. In most of those cases, a senior was beaten, kicked, shoved or even stabbed out of nowhere. Several such incidents have been caught on video.A U.S. Census survey released earlier this month found Asian American households were twice as likely as white households to admit they didn't have enough food throughout the pandemic because they were afraid to go out — not due to affordability or transportation issues. In contrast, other racial groups' households said they were experiencing food insecurity because of the pandemic. Asian American respondents didn't say specifically if it was fear of racial attacks that kept them at home.Anni Chung, president and CEO of San Francisco-based Self-Help for the Elderly, says the seniors they help were hit by a "second virus that is a hate virus." The nonprofit provides food and programs to more than 40,000 older adults in the Bay Area, most of them Asian. The organization went from transporting a pre-pandemic load of 400 meals daily to over 5,000 per day. Last year, they gave out 963,000 meals overall compared with 436,000 typically."Sometimes when we talk to seniors, they say this hatred drove them to be stuck in their house even worse than the pandemic," Chung said.For them, the fear is more than a headline but something in their own backyard."One of our clients was on the bus. Right before the man got off the bus, he just punched her," Chung said. "She said no one — not the bus driver and a number of Chinese on the bus — went to her care."Giving into that fear means seniors have missed important things like doctor's appointments or exercise routines at the park. So, in June, with some funding from the city, Self-Help for the Elderly expanded a volunteer escort service to accompany seniors on errands or outings around Chinatown and other neighborhoods. It had more than 200 requests that month.The onslaught of verbal and physical assaults has drawn more skepticism than sympathy from some. Peter Yu, a Republican U.S. Senate candidate in Colorado who is also Chinese American, came under fire last month for characterizing anti-Asian hate crimes as exaggerated."I would welcome him to look at the data and see there has been a significant increase," Kulkarni said. "This may be a situation when people refuse to see racism or misogyny. I think they're just really refusing to see reality and how unfortunately, in the U.S, we have allowed those forces to prevent people from living their lives."Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

While students and staff are required to wear masks in the district, Interim School District Superintendent Michael Burke said in an interview withMSNBCthat 5,700 Palm Beach students have opted out, per an order from Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis thatallows parents to give permission to their children to do so.Burke blamed the opt-out rule as the reason for the spike in cases, calling on DeSantis to make changes to protect students from infection."The governor has got to take responsibility for establishing the ground rules we're operating under," Burke said. "This ability for families to opt out is leading to more cases, which will ultimately send more kids home and deprive them of that traditional classroom experience."DeSantis had previously announced that the state Board of Education couldwithhold payfrom school leaders who implemented mask mandates for students after several superintendents and school board members neglected to follow an executive order from DeSantis banning school districts from requiring students to wear face coverings."I think if we really are committed to keeping kids in school, we should reassess the situation," Burke said.Josie Fischels is an intern on NPR's News Desk.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Ari ShapiroKaren ZamoraCourtney DorningTo mask or not to mask became the question at the tail end of what many wanted to be a "hot vax summer." Instead, uncertainly about life after the pandemic, and if such a thing will ever exist, lingers.Scott Olson/Getty Imageshide captionTo mask or not to mask became the question at the tail end of what many wanted to be a "hot vax summer." Instead, uncertainly about life after the pandemic, and if such a thing will ever exist, lingers.Many people were calling this the "hot vax summer," as growing vaccination numbers against the coronavirus meant a rebound in travel, andearly summer CDC guidancesaid it was safe to return to eating indoors at restaurants and bars."I think people were starting to think that there's a light at the end of the tunnel in the spring," Dr. Lucy McBride, a primary care physician in Washington, D.C, says. "People were getting vaccinated. Case rates and hospitalization rates from COVID-19 were dropping. And we knew at that moment in the spring, through accumulated evidence, that kids are protected at least in part by being surrounded by immune-vaccinated or naturally immune adults."Things look starkly different now. The highly contagious delta variant is driving a new surge of COVID-19 cases throughout the country. Masks mandates are back, and instead of experiencing nerves overrelearning how to socialize with people in person, many are dealing with feelings of anxiety, frustration and grief, knowing that this pandemic is far from over.Does anyone have an antidote for emotional whiplash? My vaccinated patients are asking."Does anyone have an antidote for emotional whiplash? My vaccinated patients are asking," Dr. McBride tweeted last month. Her own advice is that anxiety is a justified emotional response: "It's how we run from danger," she says. But it's also important to remember "to calibrate it to our particular reality," otherwise we risk running our bodies and minds into the ground.Dr. McBride spoke withAll Things Considered'sAri Shapiro about creating coping strategies for anxiety, the effects of decision fatigue — a deteriorating quality of decision-making when faced with serious questions like whether to cancel trips home or taking kids out of in-person school — and how the path forward rests on a careful line between hope and realistic expectations. Listen in the audio player above, and read on for highlights of the conversation.This interview has been edited for length and clarity.On accepting feelings of anxiety, grief and frustrationThe first step is acknowledging the trauma that we've experienced, the stacked stressors we've all been through over the last 17 months. That is real: It takes a toll on our bodies and minds. And once we allow ourselves to feel those complicated feelings, then we can unlock some coping strategies like making sure we exercise, prioritize sleep, connect with our loved ones and follow the facts. Make sure that you are looking to experts, including your trusted primary care provider, for nuanced advice to help marry broad public health advice with your unique situation. There is no one-size-fits-all prescription for human behavior in a pandemic. So, we really need to drill down into what it is that gives us a sense of safety and security, what it is we need to feel protected from disease and despair in tandem, and that is going to look different for each person.On how to deal with decision fatigueThere is no one-size-fits-all prescription for human behavior in a pandemic.We're wired, we're hypervigilant and we're tired; so many decisions, so much information. We need to realize that this is normal and that we need to give ourselves a little latitude and grace as we navigate these complex times. When we're exhausted, when our guard is down, that's when we're more prone to excess anxiety that's out of proportion to reality. That then drives behaviors that may not be appropriate for that particular situation. At the same time, we need to make sure we are protecting ourselves and our families and our communities from disease and despair. So I'm not saying I have the answer for everybody on this program; I'm saying let's recognize it, let's name it, and then let's navigate it with facts in the driver's seat and fear out of the driver's seat.On maintaining hopewhile managing expectations for the futureIt's justified to be mourning the loss of life as we knew it. It's justified to be emotionally exhausted watching the ongoing death and destruction. We also need to realize that amidst loss, there is reason for hope. We know that these vaccines against COVID-19 are extraordinarily effective, even against delta, at preventing the worst consequences. And we know exactly how to protect kids in school. We need, really, for everybody in this country to get vaccinated and to protect each other so we can move on in a healthy way.At the same time, we also need to realize that COVID is here for the duration. It's not about eliminating risk; that's just not on the menu. But what we need to do is, just as we have to modulate fears so that we protect ourselves without driving ourselves crazy, we need to manage expectations for what life is going to look like once we have this virus under better control.Karen Zamora and Courtney Dorning produced and edited this story for broadcast.

That includes New York City's Webster Hall, Los Angeles' El Rey Theatre, Denver's Bluebird Theater and others.The policy will also cover the festivals run by AEG Presents — including Coachella, Firefly, and Day N Vegas.The announcement did not specify a policy about masking.In a statement announcing the policy, AEG Presents CEO Jay Marciano said "just a few weeks ago, we were optimistic about where our business, and country, were heading. The Delta variant, combined with vaccine hesitancy, is pushing us in the wrong direction again."The live music industry had been on the verge of returning to normalcy with tours kicking off and music festivals happening across the country. But the delta variant has dampened that initial burst of excitement. Concerts have been cancelled due to positive COVID tests, shows have been delayed, even AEG's own New Orleans Jazz Fest was cancelled this year due to a surge of COVID cases across Louisiana."Certain states' regulations may override our mandate, or a few artists may not want to immediately get on board with the plan," said AEG Presents General Counsel Shawn Trell in the press release. "But we know that using our platform to take a strong position on vaccinations can make an impact."AEG's rival Live Nation took a different route. According toVariety, it's letting artists make individual decisions about whether to make any requirements at their shows.AEG Presents' policy applies only to the clubs, theaters and festivals it owns or operates. A spokesperson for the company says AEG will make the request on behalf of their touring artists when they play shows at non-AEG venues.A previous version of this story said that AEG would accept a negative test in lieu of a proof of vaccination. The company will accept negative tests only until Oct. 1. After that, concert attendees and staff must show proof of vaccination.A previous version of this story said that AEG would accept a negative test in lieu of a proof of vaccination.

Health officials in Mississippi said the state's hospital system could collapse in five to 10 days if the current trajectory continues.Current vaccinesprotect againstsevere disease, hospitalization and death — and institutions across the country are strengthening their vaccine requirements and guidance.For instance, the Centers for Disease Control and Preventionis now strongly urgingall pregnant people get vaccinated. The Food and Drug Administration could decide this week whether to extend its emergency use authorization to booster shots for immunocompromised people, a move thatDr. Anthony Faucidescribed to NPR'sMorning Editionas "imminent."More places are now requiring vaccinations, or penalizing people who don't get the shot. The Defense Departmentis moving to require vaccinesfor service members, and the Department of Health and Human Servicesis ordering themfor its thousands of health care workers. Plus, some small colleges say theywill charge unvaccinated studentsan extra fee.With different rules and regulations in place in every state, the fight to control COVID-19 looks a little different depending on where you live.You can find a state-by-state breakdown on the latest case numbers and vaccination rates here.Californiajust became the first stateto require all teachers and staff in K-12 public and private schools get vaccinated or undergo weekly coronavirus testing.As KQED's Julia McEvoyreported onMorning Edition, the move affects some 300,000 teachers and tens of thousands of school staff such as bus drivers and custodians.Gov. Gavin Newsom said the move is intended to reassure parents and motivate people to get vaccinated. Schools have until Oct. 15 to show that all employees are immunized or begin regular testing.Officials in Brevard County, on Florida's east coast, are urging residents to "consider other options before taxing ambulance services with non-emergency calls and showing up at the ER for a COVID test when other test sites are available," according to itsemergency management office.All three of the county's hospital systems are already over capacity and have had to implement surge plans that involve canceling elective procedures and converting regular rooms into COVID-19 spaces, said Brevard County Emergency Director John Scott.He noted that hospital emergency rooms are seeing "comparable surges" in patients with COVID-19 symptoms who are not necessarily experiencing emergencies, which puts other patients — such as those seeking care after accidents or heart attacks — in danger.The county's fire department is also overwhelmed with calls from coronavirus-positive and symptomatic patients, which means slower turnaround time for ambulances, too.Fire Rescue Chief Mark Schollmeyer said his department is seeing an increase in patients that "equals, if not exceeds, the height of the pandemic in 2020."

And if we track back a week or so when we look at the case positivity rate, the number of new positives that we're seeing, the rate of testing positives and the rate of hospitalizations based on what we are seeing — if we continue that trajectory within the next five to seven to 10 days, I think we're going to see failure of the hospital system in Mississippi."The University of Mississippi Medical Center system is preparing to construct a field hospital on the bottom floor of a parking garage, as theMississippi Free Press reported, and has requested federal support to boost its staffing.Read morefrom Mississippi Public Broadcasting.The state reported 1,376 COVID-19 hospitalizations on Monday,surpassing a recordit set in January.

Sneha DeyIn late July, Jeremiah Monteiro, a rising sophomore at Purdue University, got a surprise visit from his school's mascot.The black and yellow train, known as theBoilermaker Special, pulled up to Monteiro's family home in Naperville, Ill., and Purdue officials presented the sophomore with a Willy Wonka-inspired golden ticket worth $9,992, the equivalent of a year's in-state tuition at the Indiana school."I was really shocked," Monteiro says. ""I'm glad that not that many people were outside at that time."Back in May, when Monteiro had shared his proof of vaccination against COVID-19 with Purdue, he had been entered in a drawing — and officials explained he was one of 10 students to win a golden ticket."Out-of-state tuition is very expensive, so I'm glad that I can use that and help my parents out with paying tuition," says Monteiro. He immediately FaceTimed his mother in India — even though it was nearly midnight there — to share the good news.Purdue is among the hundreds of U.S. colleges that are counting on high COVID-19 vaccination rates to keep their campuses safe this fall. Colleges haveadopted vaccine mandates, a few arecharging students a feefor being unvaccinated and many arehosting vaccine clinicson move-in days. If all that wasn't enough, countless colleges are also offering flashy rewards to encourage students and faculty to get their shots.At West Virginia University, students and employees who submitted proof of vaccination were entered in a raffle for achance to winlaptops, $250 gift certificates for Chick-fil-A and a free zip-lining session on the school's course. At Ohio University,prizes includeda one-hour fall photoshoot, dinner with the men's basketball coach, a VIP ride in the school's homecoming parade and a drink named after the winner at an on-campus coffee shop."Incentives really work best when they're aimed at people who are not against being vaccinated, but they have for whatever reason not prioritized vaccination up until now," says Emily Largent, a professor of medical ethics and health policy at the University of Pennsylvania.College students, she says, are in an age group that has likely not prioritized the COVID-19 vaccine, and incentive programs give them a "tangible and immediate" reason to get their shot.The College of Charleston, in South Carolina, haspromised to celebratehigh vaccination rates with the return of some four-legged friends. Before the pandemic, "puppy therapy" was a regular campus feature, says Melantha Ardrey, director of residential life. When the student body is 70% vaccinated, therapy dogs will come back to campus, and fraternities and sororities can start recruiting in-person again.When 80% of students are vaccinated, Ardrey says the university will host a campuswide pizza party.And when 90% are vaccinated, students can expect a big splash: The school's president, Andrew Hsu, will sit in a dunk tank.Ardrey says the college tried to design its incentives around College of Charleston traditions and social events that students could not participate in during the pandemic."We wanted to highlight that human connection, that traditional college experience that students have been missing," she explains.She knows the college's 90% goal is ambitious, but she says, "We want our students to know this is important, and we want to be able to return to normal."Ardrey hopes the program will help mitigate the virus's spread on campus. Last year, she says, college administrators worked hard to prevent outbreaks in dorms; they limited the number of students who could live in residential halls, and moved those who tested positive for COVID-19 into isolation spaces.This year, with dorms fully occupied and fewer isolation spaces, Ardrey says it's even more important that students get vaccinated.Missouri State University is offering about $150,000 in prizes to vaccinated students. Those who get the shot (or shots) havea chance to winfree housing, free tuition and free parking, among other things.The cost of the prizes will be covered by private donations, says David Hall, director of university safety. The awards are a financial dream for many students — and, in some ways, for the university too."It reduces the need for testing and reduces the need for our COVID housing," Hall explains. "This actually is saving the university money, in addition to the benefits that we're getting to the students."Missouri State is based in Greene County, a conservative area thatvoted forformer President Donald Trump in the 2020 election. Hall was concerned about how the program would be received by the college's surrounding community, but he says he hasn't heard much criticism."There's an understanding of the economics of this and how it makes good financial sense," he explains. "We've not seen any significant pushback politically, even though we do live in a very conservative area."Case Western Reserve University, in Cleveland, offered vaccinated students a $500 textbook credit, free parking and a semester of free tuition. But those incentives only got them so far: The college says about 73% of students on campus were either fully vaccinated, or on their way to becoming fully vaccinated, by mid-July."We got stuck," explains Eric Kaler, the school's president. "It was clear that additional incentives were probably not going to be effective in moving us to the 95-plus percent level that we think is necessary."The college decided torequirevaccination, and Kaler says that requirement — in addition to follow up phone calls and emails to students who hadn't registered their vaccine yet — helped increase the vaccinated rate to 98% of students on campus.Kaler knows not all universities are able to require vaccines, given legal and political constraints, but for his campus, it was the thing that worked.Batool Ibrahim, a rising senior at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, says it's time for her college to go beyond incentives.The start of the fall semester is a couple weeks away, and with the surge of the delta variant, Ibrahim is worried. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that even vaccinated peoplewear a mask indoorsin areas experiencing high COVID-19 spread. Lancaster County, where the University of Nebraska-Lincoln is located, falls into that category, but the college isn't currently requiring vaccines or universal masking.Monthly massages, football tickets and free ice cream areamong the prizesthe university is handing out to students and faculty who register their vaccination status this summer.Ibrahim says those incentives can certainly start conversations about getting the vaccine, but she would like to see her school implement stricter health and safety protocols for unvaccinated students."While we're pushing students to get vaccinated on campus, we're battling with students that are coming from states where a mask mandate is banned ... or they're coming from states where the vaccine is more than questioned, it's a conspiracy," Ibrahim says. "I'm just realizing that we probably need to come at it from a lot more angles."She commutes to campus from her family's home in Lincoln, and she's worried about bringing the virus home to family members who are immunocompromised."I'm actually very scared to go into class not knowing if I'm sitting next to students that are not vaccinated," Ibrahim says."This is literally life or death that we're talking about."A university spokesperson told NPR that the school is working closely with the local health department to develop health and safety guidance, including around masking. Unvaccinated community members will also be subject to random COVID-19 testing.Valerie Jones, an advertising and public relations professor at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, says she has been closely following COVID-19 case rates this summer. At first, with vaccines widely available, she was optimistic about the safety of her classroom in the fall. She was even eyeing the university's grand prize for vaccinated faculty: a trip to Ireland to watch the Huskers play in the Aer Lingus College Football Series.But now, with COVID-19 casesrising among children, Jones worries about bringing the virus home to her 7-year-old son and an 11-year-old daughter."It does make you think a little bit differently about how we interact and how you teach," Jones explains. "You do have to be a little bit more careful in the classroom."For now, she's counting down the days until her daughter turns 12 and will be eligible for the vaccine.Sneha Dey is an intern on NPR's Education Desk.Elissa Nadworny contributed to this story.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Nurith AizenmanKomal Rana, 19, a student in the Veerni Institute program, has faced pressure to marry since India's pandemic lockdown forced her to return home to her hamlet of Jhalamand near Jodhpur.Mahender Singh Deora/Veerni Institutehide captionKomal Rana, 19, a student in the Veerni Institute program, has faced pressure to marry since India's pandemic lockdown forced her to return home to her hamlet of Jhalamand near Jodhpur.Since 2015, NPR has been following the efforts of a charity in northern India that has an interesting solution to the problem of child marriage. It's called theVeerni Institute, and it offers village girls who are child brides — or who are at risk of being married off young — the chance to continue their high school education. The institute runs what is effectively a boarding school for these girls in the city of Jodhpur. But on March 24, 2020, it had to scramble when India abruptly declared the first COVID-19 lockdown at 8 p.m. The staff had just four hours to get all 110 girls back to their homes in dozens of surrounding villages. And that would prove just the beginning of the challenges ahead. Here's what happened next:Komal Rana, then in 10th grade, remembers the anxiety that night at the dorm as she rushed to pack her things."It was all so confusing," she says. "Everything was being shut down. I worried about my family. And I worried most of all about my studies."Specifically, she adds, "My board exam."It's a national test that every sophomore in India has to pass to go on with high school. It was coming up soon, and Rana had been spending hours preparing.But the moment she got to her home in the hamlet of Jhalamand, Rana says, "Everybody in my extended family started telling my parents, 'Enough with her studies. She's already gotten through ninth grade. What's the point of studying further? It's time to get her married!' "As a college student, Mahendra Sharma took on the challenge of convincing fathers to send their daughters to the Veerni Institute. He now serves as its director.Poulomi Basu for NPRhide captionAs a college student, Mahendra Sharma took on the challenge of convincing fathers to send their daughters to the Veerni Institute. He now serves as its director.The director of the Veerni Institute boarding school program, Mahendra Sharma, says this attitude is common in communities such as Rana's for a simple reason: "It's closely connected with poverty."In the impoverished rural villages surrounding Jodhpur, there are often no high schools nearby. And parents can't afford to send their daughters to schools farther afield. Many see their daughters as just one more mouth to feed.Adding to this, Sharma says, is a fear among parents that "it's a danger" to keep unmarried girls as they grow into their teens, because they could be sexually assaulted and consequently stigmatized and rendered unable to be married. It's a sense, Sharma says, that "anything could happen to a girl. So because of that, the parents feel that the girl is their burden and they need to be released from that burden as soon as possible."Marrying a daughter into another family by the time she's 15 — or even much younger — is seen as the solution — even though child marriage is illegal in India.Veerni Institute's boarding school program offers parents an alternative. Sharma and his staff tell the families that if they send their daughter to the program she'll get free room, board and schooling through high school. And with that diploma, she can get a good job."It's explaining to the parents, 'Look their daughter can easily become an earning member of their family,' " Sharma says.But the lockdown upended that deal: Suddenly school was suspendedindefinitely.Rana had just turned 18. Her parents — who work as day laborers in construction — immediately loaded her with the chores expected of a girl in her community."We have cattle that I have to look after," she says. "There's all kinds of housework I have to do. I didn't have a chance to even touch my books."Rana, here at her family's home, has been trying to study remotely, but she says her family loaded her with chores expected of a girl in her community. "There's all kinds of housework I have to do," she says.Mahender Singh Deora/Veerni Institutehide captionRana, here at her family's home, has been trying to study remotely, but she says her family loaded her with chores expected of a girl in her community. "There's all kinds of housework I have to do," she says.Rana is drawn to science. She says she's wanted to become a doctor since she was 15 and first came to the Veerni Institute's program."After meeting the teachers there, it struck me that there is not a single doctor in my village," she says. "That's when I thought, 'Maybe I should become one!' "And she usually does well on tests. But last summer, when officials finally held the 10th grade exam, she barely passed.Even now her voice catches as she gives her score: "Fifty-four percent," she says. "When I found out, I cried for two whole days, nonstop. Because your score on the 10th-grade exam affects so much — even what job you can get."Meanwhile, Rana says, the pressure to get married was growing even more intense because of yet another twist of the pandemic: It made weddings cheap.Normally families feel obligated to invite legions of guests. "But with the lockdown, you can't invite a lot of people to a wedding," Rana says. "So everyone has gone ahead and done them. Many of my relatives have been married in this period. So my paternal grandparents have been insisting that I should be married — that there is social pressure and the cost will also be low."Back in Jodhpur, Sharma, the director of the boarding school program, was crafting a plan to help Rana and the others.The key, he says, was to make clear to their families that, even while the girls were at home, they could still get an education through remote learning. The challenge: There's no internet in the villages."Most of the girls were not connected with online stuff. It was next to impossible."Then Sharma had an insight. Because of the lockdown a lot of migrant workers had returned to their villages. And these men had mobile phones ... with data plans."So we told them, 'Look, we are creating a WhatsApp group. Would you help us?' "The migrants agreed to lend their phones, and from then on every day, the girls would do their lessons in a notebook, snap a photo and text it to the teacher.By September, Sharma came up with a more sophisticated plan. He used Veerni's funds to purchase enough tablets for each student, then loaded them with lessons. The program staff drove from village to village, dropping the tablets off along with other supplies such as food, masks, hand sanitizer — and menstrual pads, Sharma says.Rana was grateful. But she adds ruefully, "It's so much harder to follow these online lessons. In the classroom when the teacher writes on the blackboard and explains it to you, you understand so much better."So Rana was overjoyed in January when the lockdown was lifted.Sharma was relieved that all the students were able to come back. "I can proudly say that not a single girl has been married during the lockdown," he says.Still, there were signs at least some of the girls had come out of the experience with scars. Eight students, in particular, seemed notably withdrawn, Sharma says."These are girls who [before the lockdown] were doing exceedingly well in their education," he says. But on their return to the Veerni Institute, "suddenly they are not performing well. They have no intention to eat. They have no intention to participate in any activities. And yet they don't want to go back home. They don't want to meet their parents during the time of the parents meeting."Based on prior experience, he worries that the girls might have been subjected to some type of sexual assault during the months they were stuck in their villages — possibly by some of the many migrant men who flooded into the villages during the lockdown. "I don't know for sure — but these are the signs," Sharma says. He immediately arranged for a psychologist to begin visiting with the girls.But within just a few months, in April, another lockdown sent all the students right back home.For Rana, the pressure to marry returned, too. She says she's been trying to stave it off by tutoring some younger children in her community in exchange for money from their families. Because of the lockdown, she notes, there's not a lot of work for her parents. "So I'm trying to support them monetarily." And she hopes it will convince her family she can already be a breadwinner.Yet her older relatives, especially her grandfather, are unmoved. Recently, Rana says, they presented her with a suitor."Everybody in the family was saying, 'He's a good match! Go ahead with it, go ahead with it!' " she says.But Rana says her father, at least, has told them no."Thanks to the support of the boarding school program," she says, "my father is telling them that he's going to let me study, as far as I want to go."Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

Around 8,600 people could have received the saline solution instead of the vaccine, Sven Ambrosy, a district administrator of Friesland, said onFacebook."I'm totally shocked by the incident," Ambrosy said. "The district of Friesland will do everything possible to ensure that the affected people receive their vaccination protection as soon as possible."The saline solution is not dangerous, but officials are urging anyone who got vaccinated at the Roffhausen Vaccination Center during that period to get vaccinated again. They are contacting by phone or email those who may have received a fake vaccine, and a dedicated information phone line has also been established, officials wrote onFacebook.Health officials in Lower Saxony said that the nurse in question had access to the vaccines because she was "responsible for the preparation of vaccines and the preparation of syringes during her working hours in the vaccination center,"CNNreported.It is unclear if there have been any arrests or charges filed related to the case, according to Reuters. The nurse has not been named publicly, and the possible motivation has not been stated; however, the person in question did reportedly have social media posts expressing skepticism about the COVID-19 vaccines.A similarscandalunfolded in India last month. Thousands paid to receive the COVID-19 vaccine at a "vaccination camp" but instead were given shots of saline solution. Authorities arrested 14 people, alleging they gave around 4,000 people fake or expired vaccines and collected thousands of dollars in the process.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
The Associated PressCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom appears at a news conference in Oakland, Calif., on July 26. On Wednesday, he announced that the state's teachers and school staff will be required to be vaccinated for COVID-19 or undergo weekly testing.Jeff Chiu/APhide captionCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom appears at a news conference in Oakland, Calif., on July 26. On Wednesday, he announced that the state's teachers and school staff will be required to be vaccinated for COVID-19 or undergo weekly testing.SAN FRANCISCO — California will become the first state in the nation to require all teachers and staff in K-12 public and private schools toget vaccinatedor undergo weekly COVID-19 testing, Gov. Gavin Newsom announced Wednesday.The statewide vaccine mandate comes as schools return from summer break amid growing concerns of thehighly contagious delta variant.The new policy will affect the state's 320,000 public school teachers, more than 250,000 support staff — from cafeteria employees to cleaners — and at least 80,000 private school employees, according to the California Department of Education and labor unions. It will also apply to school volunteers.Newsom announced the new policy at a San Francisco Bay Area school that has already reopened after summer break. Many California schools are back in session, with others starting in the coming weeks."We think this is the right thing to do and we think this is a sustainable way to keeping our schools open and to address the number one anxiety that parents like myself have for young children," Newsom said.Several large school districts in the state have issued similar requirements in recent days, including San Francisco, Oakland, San Jose and the Long Beach Unified.California, like the rest of the country, has seen a troubling surge in COVID-19 infections because of the delta variant, which represents the vast majority of new cases. It has affected children more than previous strains of the virus.Newsom earlier issued a mask mandate for indoor classes that applies to teachers and students but until Wednesday had left the decision of whether to require vaccines up to local districts.California's two largest teachers unions, both powerful political allies to the governor, said they fully supported Newsom's policy.On Sunday, the president of the nation's second-largest teachers union, Randi Weingarten, said "the circumstances have changed.""It weighs really heavily on me that kids under 12 can't get vaccinated," said Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers.The California Teachers Association and the California Federation of Teachers both cited state and national polling that indicates nearly 90% of educators have been vaccinated but said the rising spread of the delta variant, particularly among children, makes the new policy necessary. Children under 12 are not yet eligible to be vaccinated.A vaccination site for employees of the Los Angeles school district in Inglewood, Calif., in March.Marcio Jose Sanchez/APhide captionA vaccination site for employees of the Los Angeles school district in Inglewood, Calif., in March.While Hawaii Gov. David Ige announced last week that all Department of Education staffers would be required to disclose their vaccination status or face weekly testing, California's order is far more sweeping, applying to all staff who work in both public and private schools in the country's most populous state.Vaccine mandates are perilous for Newsom, a Democrat, who faces a recall election next month fueled in part by anger over his handling of the pandemic.California was the first state to order a pandemic lockdown in March 2020, which shuttered businesses and schools statewide. While many private schools maintained in-person classes, most public schools kept students in distance learning for up to a year. Newsom faced intense political pressure to reopen schools from Republican opponents and supporters who urged him to override powerful labor unions. Many public schools finally reopened last spring, lagging much of the country.Newsom pushed for a full return to in-person learning this fall. But his mask mandate for schools has angered some parents and been criticized by Republican candidates vying to replace him.Several of the GOP candidates criticized the new plan Wednesday. Former San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer, who has encouraged everyone to get vaccinated, said state officials "should not be pushing uniform statewide orders on every school district across the state" but should leave it to local districts.Details of how the new policy will be enforced were not announced. Labor unions say those logistics still need to be worked out.Schools are required to be in full compliance with the new policy by Oct. 15, giving schools time to verify vaccination status and have in place weekly testing for unvaccinated staff, said Amelia Matier, a spokeswoman in the governor's office.A previous version of this Associated Press story said California is the first state to require all teachers to be vaccinated.

Michaeleen DoucleffIn a leaked report, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention made a surprising claim about the delta variant of the coronavirus: It "is as transmissible as: - Chicken Pox," the agencywrotein a slideshow presentation leaked toThe Washington Poston July 26.Chickenpox is one of the most contagious viruses known. Each individual can spread the virus to as many as "90% of the people close to that person," the CDCreports.Is the delta variant that contagious as well?The short answer is no, says evolutionary biologist and biostatisticianTom Wenseleersat the University of Leuven in Belgium.Loading..."Yeah, I didn't find the CDC's statement entirely accurate," says Wenseleers, who was one of the first scientists to formallycalculatethe transmission advantage of the alpha and delta variants over the original versions of SARS-CoV-2.Nonetheless, delta is still highly transmissible, he adds. It's one of the most contagious respiratory viruses that we know of, he says.Here's why.When scientists measure a virus's transmissibility, they often use what's known as R0, or "R nought. " It's the number of people a sick person will infect when the entire population is vulnerable to the virus."So it's the virus's potential of spreading, given ideal conditions for the virus, when no one has any immunity," says computational biologistKarthik Gangavarapuat the Scripps Research Institute.For example, the flu has an R0 of about two. Each person infected with flu passes the virus on to two people on average. Some people will infect more than two people, and some will infect fewer. But over time, the average will be about two.Chickenpox, on the other hand, is way more contagious, Gangavarapu says.Chickenpox has an R0 of about nine or 10. So each person with chickenpox infects about 10 other people on average. Outbreaks are explosive.For SARS-CoV-2, the R0 has actually risen over the course of the pandemic as the virus evolved. When the coronavirus first emerged in 2019, SARS-CoV-2 was slightly more contagious than flu, Gangavarapu says. "The initial COVID-19 strain had an R0 between two and three."Then about a year later, the virus began to mutate quickly. The alpha variant emerged, likely in the U.K., and was more transmissible than the original strain. A few months later, the delta variant emerged, most likely in India. It was even more transmissible than alpha."For the delta variant, the R0 is now calculated at between six and seven," Wenseleers says. So it's two- to three-times as contagious as the original version of SARS-CoV-2 (R0 = 2 to 3) but less contagious than the chickenpox (R0 = 9 to 10).So why did the CDC say the delta variant was "just as transmissible as" the chickenpox?For one, the leaked document underestimated the R0 for chickenpox and overestimated the R0 for the delta variant. "The R0 values for delta were preliminary and calculated from data taken from a rather small sample size," a federal official told NPR. The value for the chickenpox (and other R0s in the slideshow) came from a graphic fromThe New York Times, which wasn't completely accurate."At the end of the day, this delta variant is much more transmissible than the alpha variant," the official added. "That's the message people need to take from this." The official requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media on this topic.The difference between an R0 of three and six is massive. For example, with the original strain of SARS-CoV-2, one person would infect about three people, and each of those people would infect three more. So after only two rounds of transmission, cases would rise by nine (3 x 3 = 9). After three rounds, cases would rise by 27 (3 x 3 x 3 = 27). But with the delta variant, the first person would infect six others, who would each then infect six more people. So after two rounds of transmission, cases would already rise by 36 (6 x 6 = 36). After three rounds, cases would surge by 216 (6 x 6 x 6 = 216).With an R0 of six, delta will be extremely difficult to slow down unless populations reach high levels of vaccination, Wenseleers says. And even then surges in cases will still occur, as is now happening inIcelandand parts of the U.S. The vaccine is less than 90% effective at stopping infections with delta, meaning at least 1 in 10 people could have breakthrough infections. And vaccinated people can still spread the virus. In addition, people who aren't vaccinated have a very high risk of infection, Wenseleers says. "Anyone that chooses not to get vaccinated will in all likelihood get infected by the delta variant over the coming months."For example, in San Francisco, daily case levels are rapidly rising toward those seen last winter despite the fact that more than 70% of the population is vaccinated, per San Francisco Department of Public Healthreports.Although cases of delta are inevitable, hospitalizations aren't, Wenseleers points out. "As long as people would get vaccinated, then we will not get huge wave of hospitalizations." For example, the city of San Francisco has had 3,041 people hospitalized with COVID-19 since March 18, 2020. Only 16 of them were fully vaccinated.In an earlier version of this story, evolutionary biologist and biostatisticianTom Wenseleersat the University of Leuven in Belgium stated that the delta variant of the coronavirus was "probably the most contagious respiratory virus that we know, for the moment." Wenseleers clarifies that he was referring to viruses that primarily affect the respiratory tract. Although the primary infection with measles occurs in other tissues besides the respiratory tract, measles can cause a runny nose and sneezing. Its R0 factor makes it more contagious than the delta variant.In an earlier version of this story, evolutionary biologist and biostatisticianTom Wenseleersat the University of Leuven in Belgium stated that the delta variant of the coronavirus was "probably the most contagious respiratory virus that we know, for the moment."

The Associated PressAndres Veloso, 12, gets vaccinated on Monday in Miami. Florida is reporting a surge of COVID-19 cases caused by the highly contagious delta variant.Marta Lavandier/APhide captionAndres Veloso, 12, gets vaccinated on Monday in Miami. Florida is reporting a surge of COVID-19 cases caused by the highly contagious delta variant.The rapidly escalating surge in COVID-19 infections across the U.S. has caused a shortage of nurses and other front-line staff in virus hot spots that can no longer keep up with the flood of unvaccinated patients and are losing workers to burnout and lucrative out-of-state temporary gigs.Florida, Louisiana,Arkansasand Oregon all have more people hospitalized with COVID-19 than at any other point in the pandemic, and nursing staffs are badly strained.InFlorida, virus cases have filled so many hospital beds that ambulance services and fire departments are straining to respond to emergencies. Some patients wait inside ambulances for up to an hour before hospitals in St. Petersburg, Florida, can admit them — a process that usually takes about 15 minutes, Pinellas County Administrator Barry Burton said.One person who suffered a heart attack was bounced from six hospitals before finding an emergency room in New Orleans that could take him in, said Joe Kanter, Louisiana's chief public health officer."It's a real dire situation," Kanter said. "There's just not enough qualified staff in the state right now to care for all these patients."People line up for COVID-19 tests in North Miami on Monday.Marta Lavandier/APhide captionPeople line up for COVID-19 tests in North Miami on Monday.Michelle Thomas, a registered nurse and a manager of the emergency department at a Tucson, Arizona, hospital, resigned three weeks ago after hitting a wall."There was never a time that we could just kind of take a breath," Thomas said Tuesday. "I hit that point ... I can't do this anymore. I'm so just tapped out."She helped other nurses cope with being alone in rooms with dying patients and holding mobile phones so family members could say their final goodbyes."It's like incredibly taxing and traumatizing," said Thomas, who is unsure if she will ever return to nursing.Miami's Jackson Memorial Health System, Florida's largest medical provider, has been losing nurses to staffing agencies, other hospitals and pandemic burnout, Executive Vice President Julie Staub said. The hospital's CEO says nurses are being lured away to jobs in other states at double and triple the salary.Staub said system hospitals have started paying retention bonuses to nurses who agree to stay for a set period. To cover shortages, nurses who agree to work extra are getting the typical time-and-a-half for overtime plus $500 per additional 12-hour shift. Even with that, the hospital sometimes still has to turn to agencies to fill openings."You are seeing folks chase the dollars," Staub said. "If they have the flexibility to pick up and go somewhere else and live for a week, months, whatever and make more money, it is a very enticing thing to do. I think every health care system is facing that."Nearly 70% of Florida hospitals are expecting critical staffing shortages in the next week, according to the Florida Hospital Association.In Oregon, Gov. Kate Brown announced Tuesday that state employees must be fully vaccinated by Oct. 18 or six weeks after a COVID-19 vaccine receives full federal approval, whichever is later. Her office planned to announce a statewide indoor mask requirement on Wednesday."Oregon is facing a spike in COVID-19 hospitalizations — consisting overwhelmingly of unvaccinated individuals — that is quickly exceeding the darkest days of our winter surge," Brown said. "When our hospitals are full, there will be no room for additional patients needing care."Texas Gov. Greg Abbott on Monday directed state officials to use staffing agencies to find additional medical staff from beyond the state's borders as the delta variant overwhelms its present staffing resources. He also has sent a letter to the Texas Hospital Association to request that hospitals postpone all elective medical procedures voluntarily.Parts of Europe have so far avoided a similar hospital crisis, despite wide circulation of the delta variant, with help from vaccines.Janice Perez, a clinical technician, is tested for COVID-19 in North Miami, after a colleague at her office recently tested positive.Marta Lavandier/APhide captionJanice Perez, a clinical technician, is tested for COVID-19 in North Miami, after a colleague at her office recently tested positive.The United Kingdom on Monday had more than 5,900 COVID-19 patients in hospitals, but the latest surge has not overwhelmed medical centers. As of Tuesday, the government said 75% of adults have been fully vaccinated.The same was true in Italy, where the summer infections have not resulted in any spike in hospital admissions, intensive care admissions or deaths. About 3,200 people in the nation of 60 million were hospitalized Tuesday in regular wards or ICUs, according to Health Ministry figures.Italian health authorities advising the government on the pandemic attribute the relatively contained hospital numbers to the nation's inoculation campaign, which has fully vaccinated 64.5% of Italians 12 years of age or older.The U.S. is averaging more than 116,000 new coronavirus infections a day along with about 50,000 hospitalizations, levels not experienced since the winter surge. Unlike other points in the pandemic, hospitals now have more non-COVID patients for everything from car accidents to surgeries that were postponed during the outbreak.That has put even more burden on nurses who were already fatigued after dealing with constant death among patients and illnesses in their ranks."Anecdotally, I'm seeing more and more nurses say, 'I'm leaving, I've had enough,'" said Gerard Brogan, director of nursing practice with National Nurses United, an umbrella organization of nurses unions across the U.S. "'The risk to me and my family is just too much.'"Hawaii is seeing more new daily virus cases than ever.In a Honolulu hospital's emergency department, patients have had to wait for beds for more than 24 hours on gurneys in a curtained-off section because there's not enough staff to open more beds, nurse Patrick Switzer said."Somebody who's been sitting in the emergency room for 30 hours is miserable," he said.He described being "in this constant state of anxiety, knowing that you don't have the tools that you need to take care of your patients because we're stretched so thin."COVID-19 hospitalizations have now surpassed the pandemic's worst previous surge in Florida, with no signs of letting up, setting a record of 13,600 on Monday, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. More than 2,800 required intensive care. At the height of last year's summer surge, there were more than 10,170 COVID-19 hospitalizations.At Westside Regional Medical Center in Plantation, Fla., the number of COVID-19 patients has doubled each week for the past month, wearing down the already short staff, said Penny Ceasar, who handles admissions there.The hospital has converted overflow areas to accommodate the rise in admissions. Some staffers have fallen ill with COVID-19."It's just hard. We're just tired. I just want this thing over," Ceasar said.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

Joe HernandezA child watches as a nurse administers a COVID-19 vaccine during a pop-up vaccination event in April at Lynn Family Stadium in Louisville, Ky.Jon Cherry/Getty Imageshide captionA child watches as a nurse administers a COVID-19 vaccine during a pop-up vaccination event in April at Lynn Family Stadium in Louisville, Ky.Coronavirus cases among children are rising at a time when the highly infectious delta variant is advancing across the United States at a rapid clip.New state-level dataanalyzed by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Children's Hospital Association shows that children accounted for roughly 15% of all newly reported COVID-19 casesacross the nation for the week ending on Aug. 5.Nearly 94,000 child cases of COVID-19 were recorded during that period, a 31% increase over the roughly 72,000 cases reported a week earlier. In the week before then, there were 39,000 new child cases.Loading...The American Academy of Pediatrics and the Children's Hospital Association said that new coronavirus cases in children have been increasing since July after a period of decline in the early summer."This virus is really tracking the unvaccinated," said Dr. Yvonne Maldonado, a professor of pediatrics and infectious diseases at Stanford University. "Because children under 12 are not able to be vaccinated, we're just seeing the same increase in infections in that group because [the delta variant] is so infectious."One big question for parents — whether delta is making kids sicker than previous strains — still has no clear answer.But the numbers appear to show that severe illness, hospitalization and death are rare in children infected with the coronavirus.In states where data was available, less than 2% of all child COVID-19 cases required hospitalization and 0.00% to 0.03% were fatal."I'm not seeing any patterns that suggest the virus is more virulent or more serious or more severe in children than it was before this variant appeared," Maldonado added.Still, the growing number of children hospitalized with COVID-19 could further strain an already overburdened pediatric health care system.Many children's hospitals are not only dealing with patients who've contracted the coronavirus but also kids with issues indirectly related to the pandemic. Many children have developed mental health problems stemming from social isolation, and others deferred medical care during the peak of the outbreak last year."These kind of indirect impacts of COVID have actually been a much bigger volume impact on pediatric intensive care capacity than the direct count of COVID kids," said Mark Wietecha, CEO of the Children's Hospital Association.Despite no sharp rise in the number of hospitalizations, Wietecha said many children hospitalized with COVID-19 now, likely driven by the delta variant, are sicker than those who had contracted previous strains. While the overall picture remains unclear, he said pediatric hospitals are nonetheless now in need of specially trained medical staff who understand the unique requirements of treating young patients.Cases are spiking in children as many of them prepare for the start of a new school year, which is now tinged with uncertainty. Some states areattempting to block school districts from requiring students to wear masks.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Vanessa RomoVaccination cards are key to a lot of activities, so they need to be both protected and available.Rogelio V. Solis/APhide captionVaccination cards are key to a lot of activities, so they need to be both protected and available.While the debate over mandated "vaccine passports" rages on, a growing number ofemployers, businesses and venues are demandingproofof vaccination. That's making it increasingly important for workers and customers to carry documentation that can be whipped out whenever the need arises.Here are some suggestions to ensure that vaccinated people are always covered.Everyone who gets at least one inoculation gets one of these paper cards from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, at 4-by-3 inches they are larger than the average wallet, which means they're bound to suffer some abuse. The good news is they can be easily protected from everyday wear and tear with a little extra care.One option is to get the card laminated. Some office supply stores, such as Staples, were offering the service for free earlier this year but now are charging about $3 per card.Along the same lines, there are lots offunctionaland/orcutevaccination card holders for safekeeping.Yes, we do live in the 21st century! And some states, counties and cities have made it quite easy to get a digital COVID-19 vaccination record that can be stored on a smartphone or computer or be printed out.Some states make these available through their department of health websites, while others have linked the vaccine records to digital state IDs. You can run a search for the name of your state and the keywords COVID-19 vaccine digital record.Walmart and Sam's Cluballow users to store their COVID-19 vaccine records in a pharmacy account on Walmart.com or Samsclub.com. The company says the vaccine record can be printed, saved on a device, or shared.While all of the digital records vary slightly, the general procedure requires a person's first and last name, date of birth, email or phone number, and maybe a PIN to access a personalized link.The digital cards themselves contain the recipient's full name, date of birth, the vaccine manufacturer and dates the shot or shots were administered. They also include a scannable QR code. Users are directed to store the card on their phone — either within an app or take a screenshot for easy access.You may also want to reach out to your vaccine provider and ask whether a digital card is something they now offer.Additionally, Apple'sfall iOS 15 software updatewill allow users to store the information in its upgraded Health app.In a pinch, a photo of the CDC-issued card can also work. Just make sure it is easily accessible by putting it in a recognizable album as this reporter learned the hard way. (Found it after 20 minutes of scrolling through my photos.)Another option is to scan a photo of the card into a Notes app and then pin the note so it can be quickly retrieved.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Will StoneModerna and Pfizer COVID-19 vaccines sit in a refrigerator at a mass vaccination site in June in Cranston, R.I. As demand for vaccines lags in the U.S., expiration dates loom. At the same time, lower-income countries are eager for more doses as infections rise.David Goldman/APhide captionModerna and Pfizer COVID-19 vaccines sit in a refrigerator at a mass vaccination site in June in Cranston, R.I. As demand for vaccines lags in the U.S., expiration dates loom. At the same time, lower-income countries are eager for more doses as infections rise.The vast majority of COVID-19 vaccines have gone straight from drug companies to affluent countries such as the United States. Worldwide only about 1% have made it to low-income countries.And here's what's happening all across the United States: Millions of vaccine doses at risk of spoiling are sitting on freezer shelves, with no easy way to get them to countries desperately waiting for shots.In North Carolina, for example, more than half a million Pfizer shots are set to expire by the end of August. Alabama just threw away 65,000 doses. Last month, Arkansas said it was going to toss 80,000.State health officialswarn the current demandfor the vaccine may not be enough to get much of the supply into arms before they reach their expiration dates.It's a stark reminder of the chasm between the COVID-19 vaccine haves and have-nots.How many shots are ultimately at risk of going to waste? The answer is hard to come by given how decentralized the systems are.Jenny Ottenhoff,senior policy director for global health and education at the ONE Campaign, says her best guess is that the total number of expired vaccines combined with those about to spoil in the coming weeks and months, is in the millions in the United States."We should be moving those as quickly as possible, especially as we know more doses will be coming into the U.S in the coming months," she says.The Food and Drug Administration came up with a workaround recently when itextended the shelf lifeof the Johnson & Johnson vaccine by six weeks — buying states more time to make use of the shots. But in some places, the grace period won't change the fact that interest in vaccines has dwindled. And brands such as Pfizer have not yet received the OK to move back the expiration date.So there are still a good chunk of vaccines that won't make it into arms before they spoil."I'm angry, upset, disappointed," says José R. Romero, the Arkansas secretary of health. "As a nation, we've worked so hard to get these vaccines out, and not to have them accepted by the public is very disappointing, very disappointing. If you look at it from a global point of view, millions of people are affected by this virus around the world and we're throwing it away."It is difficult to understand and difficult to accept."It also seems difficult to understand why the soon-to-expire doses can't be sent to nations that don't have enough vaccines. But at the moment, a combination of red tape and logistical challenges have left states with no clear pathway to send the extra doses to countries that need them.States can't just bypass the federal government and send their leftover doses to countries that need them, but federal officials should be able to give states permission to take this route, saysGovind Persad, a professor at the University of Denver Sturm College of Law.Yet there are legitimate concerns about trying to retrieve doses and ensuring that all the conditions of storage and temperature are maintained, saysPrashant Yadav, a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development and an expert on health care supply chains.Aside from the logistics, moving these soon-to-expire doses is not only complex, Yadav says, but also runs up against some legal obstacles, including concerns among drugmakers about liability if their products cause harm in another country.Persad says another barrier could be the contracts that the Trump administration signed with vaccine makers in which there appears to be some language restricting the use of vaccines abroad — although the contract language isn't fully public."Most of us have come to realize, once it's out in the states and particularly if it's been distributed to local communities, pulling it all back is kind of asking for some error or problem," saysDr. Marcus Plescia, chief medical officer for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials. "The only option is to get people to take it here."States have already stopped asking for new deliveries — a move that at least assures the pool of unused doses isn't growing any larger, he says.Meanwhile, the White House is purchasing and giving away doses. Last week,the Biden administrationannounced it had donatedand shipped 110 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines to more than 65 countries and plans to ship hundreds of millions more later this year and next. Those doses, however, have come from manufacturers and federal stockpiles, not from states that already have the doses in hand."Is there something different about the vaccine being in a state already, as opposed to coming directly from the stockpile?" Persad says. And it's also unclear why drug companies would want to sue if vaccines were used abroad, he says, "given that the basic sort of PR [public relations] of the suit would be we would rather these vaccines be thrown out in America than used to protect people overseas."International advocates are pressuring the United States to get its unused doses to other countries. Every dose available right now remains a precious resource in the face of the global surge of the delta variant, saysDr. Carissa Etienne, director of the Pan American Health Organization, an international public health agency affiliated with the World Health Organization."Please don't wait until you have surplus doses. You [countries that have enough doses] need to share out of what you have now," Etienne told reporters last month.While it could be complex and costly to reclaim these orphaned doses, the University of Denver's Persad says the U.S. shouldn't lose sight of what those vials represent — human lives that could be saved: "If you get even 100 vaccines that would help people instead of being wasted, that's actually really important."Editor's note: The 80,000 doses in Arkansas expected to expire in July was an estimate provided to NPR by the Arkansas Department of Health on July 29. After this story was published, a spokesperson for the Arkansas Department of Health wrote to say that the actual wastage turned out to be much lower, with only 5,744 doses expiring in July. The spokesperson attributed the gap between the expected and actual wasted doses to more complete reporting from vaccine providers and increased vaccination rates. NPR was not able to independently verify the information.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Pien HuangKindergartner Allyson Zavala joined with other students and school superintendent Austin Buetner for a class selfie in April inside teacher Alicia Pizzi's classroom at Maurice Sendak Elementary School in North Hollywood, Calif.Robert Gauthier/Los Angeles Times via Getty Imageshide captionKindergartner Allyson Zavala joined with other students and school superintendent Austin Buetner for a class selfie in April inside teacher Alicia Pizzi's classroom at Maurice Sendak Elementary School in North Hollywood, Calif.It's inevitable that when kids mix — returning from camp or heading back to school — germs spread. And in a pandemic year fueled by the delta variant, some of those germs may cause COVID-19. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has advice for keeping your child protected from this highly contagious version of the coronavirus now and this fall: Mask up in schools and other crowded venues, and make sure everyone age 12 and older in the family gets a COVID-19 shot.But what if your kids are younger than that? What if they develop symptoms or come into contact with someone who tests positive for the coronavirus?Rules for testing and quarantining vary from place to place, so we asked several public health experts — all parents — about their personal strategies for keeping their kids and families safe these days.Keep your child at home and consult the pediatrician."This happened to us [recently], for camp," saysSeema Lakdawala, a virologist who studies flu transmission at the University of Pittsburgh. She has two daughters, ages 5 and 8. "My [8-year-old] daughter woke up and was sneezing and had a runny nose."She kept her daughter home and then called the pediatrician to talk through her symptoms. The likely culprit was allergies, the doctor told her; the child has known allergies to grass pollen, and it's already hay fever season where she lives. Sure enough, when Lakdawala gave her daughter allergy medication, her symptoms resolved.The key, says Lakdawala, is that her daughter had no known exposures to COVID-19. "If we had been on a plane recently, or otherwise traveling, then I would definitely want to get her tested for COVID," the mom says.Test for the coronavirus when warranted.Ahead of those sniffles, while everyone's healthy, figure out where your child and others in your home can getPCR-testedfor the coronavirus on short notice with quick results. "Our pediatrician's office, like many pediatric clinics, has walk-in hours for children who are sick," saysDr. Cassandra Pierre, medical director of public health programs at Boston Medical Center and a parent of 3-year-old twins. "Those hours are in the morning, which means my child could get tested and, hopefully, get the results in the same day."Keep your child at home until those test results come back.Another option is to purchase some over-the-counter,rapid antigen testsfrom the pharmacy now and keep them in your medicine cabinet for a time when you might need them, saysGigi Gronvall, an immunologist and researcher at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. She has two kids, ages 11 and 14. These swab tests are less sensitive than PCR tests (so they might miss very minor infections). But they're quick, easy to use, and considered to be fairly accurate in people who are actively sick. "They certainly provide peace of mind, especially if they're symptomatic," Gronvall says.Even if those symptoms turn out to be "just a cold," try not to spread it.Whatever your child's COVID-19 status, please don't send them back to school if they're still coughing and sneezing, Pierre says.Her 3-year-old was home sick from day care with a cold the day we spoke with her. "If my son is still sick tomorrow, still stuffy and having nasal secretions, I wouldn't necessarily put him right back and expose other children to another respiratory virus," Pierre says. As difficult as it is to arrange for child care, the pandemic has driven home to her that "we really rely on the decisions that other people make," she says. "I want to make sure that I'm making good decisions to prevent other children and parents potentially from getting sick."If kids must return to camp or school or day care with mild cold symptoms, they should wear masks consistently, saysDr. Monica Gandhi, an infectious disease doctor at the University of California, San Francisco."Don't panic," says Pierre. "The first thing to remember is that children are incredibly resilient." Most cases of COVID-19 inchildren are mild. Keep a close eye on your child and check in with the pediatrician, particularly if your child has underlying health conditions that may need monitoring.Think ahead of time about who will take care of whom — and how — if somebody gets sick.Households are complicated, but think right now about how you could limit the sick child's contact with others in your home. Consider how you and other members could best divvy up care. Lakdawala and her husband have walked through this scenario. They are both fully vaccinated, but their two children are not yet eligible. If one child tests positive for the coronavirus, she says, they will split the household into parent-child pairs in different parts of the house. They might then take turns in the kitchen and minimize the amount of time they're in enclosed spaces with each other.If your situation requires more backup, Lakdawala suggests reaching out to fully vaccinated family members, friends or neighbors who may be able to step in and offer help.Layer protections to reduce the risk of household transmissionThe key is to rely on multiple types of protection.The first defense is vaccines, Pierre says. "We really should be thinking about getting as many people in the household vaccinated as possible to protect themselves, but also to protect the child." Vaccinated people can provide carewithout needing to quarantine, so long as they remain healthy, without COVID-19 symptoms.An older child who is sick with COVID-19 may be able to isolate in a bedroom, maybe with a bathroom to themselves, says Pierre. This limits the presence of the virus to a specific part of the home.But even if space and bathrooms are limited, there are proven ways to reduce the risks of transmission.COVID-19 is primarily transmittedthrough the air, so Pierre notes that "respiratory hygiene is your No. 1 priority."If indoor space is shared with a sick person, everyone in the houseshould wear masksas much as possible, says Gandhi. This means at all times, except when eating, drinking and sleeping. For the sick person, this reduces the amount of virus they exhale into the air, and for others in the household, it limits the amount of virus they breathe in.Get fresh air into the house to disperse any clouds of virus that may be lingering in the air, Lakdawala advises: "Open the windows, turn on the fans, get some air circulating."Air purifierscould help filter virus out of the air in a closed room, Pierre adds.Another possible route of transmission is picking up the live virus on your hands and touching your eyes, nose or mouth. So periodicallyclean and disinfectshared surfaces such as the bathroom counter or kitchen table, particularly if a sick person has been coughing or sneezing nearby, Pierre says. After a few days (the CDC recommends3-5 daysafter a known exposure), it's a good idea to get the rest of the household tested for the coronavirus.Keep your child home until they're no longer contagious.Though asymptomatic infections can spread disease, too, people with COVID-19 are most likely to spread the infection to others when symptoms first appear. So10 days later, if those symptoms have resolved without the continued use of fever-reducing medicine, the illness is no longer considered contagious, Gronvall says. Sometimes, children develop symptoms such as loss of taste and smell that can last longer, "but as far as there being a danger to others, these symptoms don't need to interfere with them going back to school," she says.Wear any mask that fits well — with no gaps around the mouth, nose or chin — and is comfortable. While adults these days are being encouragedto step up our mask gamebeyond cloth versions, the advice for children may be a little different. "The best mask is one that they can wear for long periods of time, even in school," Pierre says. "A cotton mask is the most comfortable, lightweight and breathable."Bonus points if the kids like the design. "My kids have the cutest masks," Lakdawala says. "They have the ones that look like little cat faces and smiley faces or dogs or bears or whatever." Gronvall's 11-year-old prefers a mask that is "silky and has pictures of cats in outer space that have lasers coming out of their eyes," so she has ordered several of those masks to send with him to school. A child is more likely to wear a mask they find appealing, and to wear it consistently and correctly.If you want to add more protection, Gandhi suggests wearing two masks, which creates a tighter mask fit on the face, or adding a filter layer to a child's mask. "You can buy a cloth mask with a pocket, anduse vacuum bag material as a filter. It's thin and it blocks virus very effectively," she says. Still, she agrees that the bottom line with kids is comfort. So if these interventions make them less likely to wear the mask, she says you can skip them.The reassurance of physical contact — hugs and cuddles — can be important, especially for little ones, Lakdawala says. "I'm not going to deny or deprive my child of that comfort when they're not feeling well." And you may feel that way, too. But Pierre says that if the kids are older, "I would recommend physical distancing."Studies suggestthat a person with COVID-19 is most infectious in the first five days, so Gandhi says she'd aim to limit close contact in that period. "For the first five days, I'd let them watch TV and I would try to not be as cuddly," she says."At night, if a child has a fever and needs comfort, that can be difficult," says Pierre. Nobody recommends wearing a protective mask while sleeping, but if you're sharing a bed with a sick child, you might consider facing in the same direction from behind them, or away — so they're not breathing directly into your face — and opening up the windows or using air purifiers to help clear the air.Lakdawala says wearing masks when someone is sick with COVID-19, and, again, divvying up care responsibilities between the parents (including hugs), can help reduce the risk that everyone in the household gets sick.If your child is unvaccinated, quarantine your child, wear masks, watch for symptoms and test.If the school district provides specific instructions for quarantining, follow that guidance, Pierre says. The CDC has a specific definition for "close contact" between kids in schools, andit is more lenientthan in other settings: "If your child is physically distancing 3 feet from another child who's sick and both of them are wearing masks consistently, we would not actually consider that to be an exposure," says Pierre. "But if that is not what has happened, then the child needsto be quarantined."In the house, take reasonable precautions, says Pierre, "but it's not necessarily with the rigor of having to go to your room and stay there," unless your child develops symptoms or tests positive for the coronavirus. Instead, try to keep some physical distance between the quarantining child and other household members, and have the child and/or those other family members wear a mask, especially those who are the most vulnerable and unvaccinated.In Lakdawala's home, her two children — both too young to be vaccinated — typically share a room. If one were in quarantine, "I would separate them in terms of where they would sleep, but I would probably still send the other one to school if it was just an exposure," she says.She would wait a few days and then get the quarantining child tested for the coronavirus with a PCR test. In the interim, she'dwatch for symptoms. If no symptoms develop or the test comes back negative, it's fine to resume all the usual activitiesafter seven to 14 days, depending on your school's policy.And while the child in quarantine is staying home, Lakdawala says, the rest of the household can keep on with essential business — school, work, grocery shopping and the like — with some precautions. The whole family should refrain from playdates or dinners out and wear masks in public, indoor settings.NPR editor and producerJane Greenhalghand correspondentRob Steincontributed reporting to this story.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Vanessa RomoGov. Ron DeSantis said the state Board of Education may "narrowly tailor any financial consequences" for those who violate the law. It adds that the governor, who has opposed all face covering mandates since the start of the pandemic, is intent on protecting parents' rights.Rick Bowmer/APhide captionGov. Ron DeSantis said the state Board of Education may "narrowly tailor any financial consequences" for those who violate the law. It adds that the governor, who has opposed all face covering mandates since the start of the pandemic, is intent on protecting parents' rights.As the majority of Florida's K-12 schools prepare to reopen campuses at full capacity this week — many of them on Tuesday — Gov. Ron DeSantis announced that the state Board of Education could withhold pay from school leaders who implement mask mandates for students.The move to potentially punish educators followsdays of controversyduring which school district superintendents and school board members seeking to comply withCenters for Disease Control and Prevention guidelinesignored anexecutive orderfrom DeSantis banning school districts from requiring students to wear face masks.In a statement toCBS4, the governor's office said the State Board of Education may "narrowly tailor any financial consequences" for those who violate the law. It adds that the governor, who has opposed all face covering mandates since the start of the pandemic, is intent on protecting parents' rights."Ultimately — Education funding is for the students. The kids didn't make the decision to encroach upon parents' rights. So any financial penalties for breaking the rule would be targeted to those officials who made that decision," the governor's spokeswoman, Christina Pushaw,saidin a tweet.Teachers and other employees' pay would not be withheld."Only the salaries of those superintendents and school board members who intentionally defy the EO and the subsequent rules protecting parents' rights" could be affected by the latest directive, sheexplained.Florida is ensnared in an alarming COVID-19 spike fueled by the highly contagious delta variant, making many pockets of the state dangerous hot spots. Case numbers aresoaringand hospitals are filling up with COVID-19 patients, including children.As of Sunday, at least135 childrenwere hospitalized with the coronavirus.Children 12 and older are eligible for the COVID-19 vaccines, but Dr. Marcos Mestre, who works at the Nicklaus Children's Foundation Hospital in Miami, told NPR all of the patients he has seen within that age range have not been inoculated.Due to the highly contagious nature of the delta variant, the CDCrecommendsuniversal indoor masking for all students ages 2 and older, regardless of vaccination status. The agency also says students should maintain at least 3 feet of physical distance within the classroom to reduce transmission risk and recommends screening tests.Miami-Dade Public Schools Superintendent Alberto Carvalho responded to DeSantis' threat on Monday afternoon. He said the fourth-largest school district in the nation has established a plan made in consultation with health experts."At no point shall I  allow my decision to be influenced by a threat to my paycheck; a small price to pay considering the gravity of this issue and the potential impact to the health and well-being of our students and dedicated employees," Carvalho said.He added: "I want to thank the governor for recognizing that our students should not be penalized."Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Jaclyn DiazThe Norwegian Gem cruise ship leaves the Port of Miami in April 2020. The Norwegian Gem's first trip since a pandemic-induced hiatus is scheduled to sail from Miami on Aug. 15.Cliff Hawkins/Getty Imageshide captionThe Norwegian Gem cruise ship leaves the Port of Miami in April 2020. The Norwegian Gem's first trip since a pandemic-induced hiatus is scheduled to sail from Miami on Aug. 15.Norwegian Cruise Line can require that passengers show proof of a COVID-19 vaccination before boarding any of its ships in Florida, a federal judge has ruled.The decision by U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams in Miami to grant Norwegian's request for a preliminary injunction comes despite a state law passed in May that fines businesses that require proof of such vaccinations.The law, championed by Gov. Ron DeSantis, slaps businesses with a fine of $5,000 per violation for asking customers to prove that they have been inoculated against the coronavirus.In her decision, Williams said Norwegian would likely succeed in a court trial with its argument that Florida's so-called vaccine passport ban risks public health and infringes on the cruise line's First Amendment rights.Williams' decision also allows Norwegian to proceed with its first trip from Miami since the pandemic widely disrupted the cruise line industry in March 2020. Norwegian Cruise Line is one of several companies that sail from ports in Florida.Frank Del Rio, president and chief executive officer of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings,said in a statement Sundaythat the company welcomes Williams' ruling. He said it "allows us to sail with 100% fully vaccinated guests and crew which we believe is the safest and most prudent way to resume cruise operations amid this global pandemic."Confirmed coronavirus cases and hospitalizations in Floridaare at an all-time highas the delta variant surges around the nation and the world. On Sunday, approximately 1 in 4 hospital beds in Florida had a COVID-19 patient in it.Despite this, DeSantiscontinues to fightmore sweeping coronavirus measures such as mask mandates.Norwegian said it implements a 100% vaccination level rule for guests and crew members in each port it sails out of around the world.The company is relying on "robust science-backed health and safety protocols" in which vaccines are the "cornerstone" to provide what Norwegian believes is the safest experience for travelers.Despite the ongoing pandemic, and the latest surge in Florida, the state prohibited Norwegian from implementing its vaccine documentation rule. The company filed its lawsuit in July against Florida's surgeon general and the head of the state's Department of Health after failing to reach an agreement with officials over vaccine requirements.Neither the surgeon general nor the Florida Department of Health issued a statement on the judge's ruling Sunday.To date, the halt in operations during the pandemic cost Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings, which operates the Norwegian Cruise Line, Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises brands, more than $6 billion, the company claims in court documents.Norwegian Cruise Line's first trip departing out of Floridasince the pandemic disrupted business last year is scheduled to leave Miami on Sunday.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Geoff BrumfielIt's not a known side effect, but some people are experiencing changes to their menstrual cycles after getting the COVID-19 vaccine. Reports have led some researchers to take a closer look at the possible connection.Scott Eisen/Getty Imageshide captionIt's not a known side effect, but some people are experiencing changes to their menstrual cycles after getting the COVID-19 vaccine. Reports have led some researchers to take a closer look at the possible connection.Sore arms. Headaches. Low-grade fevers.These are some of the expected side effects of a COVID-19 vaccine — a sign that the body's mounting an immune response and learning how to fend off the coronavirus.But thousands of people in the U.S. think they may have had other side effects that drugmakers and doctors never warned them about: unexpected changes in their menstrual cycles. Though many researchers and gynecologists say a causal link hasn't yet been established between the vaccines and the reported changes, it hasn't stopped the worry among some people. And so far, scientists haven't collected much data on whether or how the vaccines might affect a menstrual period.Kate Clancy,a human reproductive ecologist and associate professor of anthropology at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, and biological anthropologistKatharine Leeof Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis hope to change that. Clancy has centered her research for decades around uterine function, ovarian hormones and menstrual cycles, and Lee is also a data engineer; her current postdoctoral work includes "collaborations on physical activity and reproductive hormones across the lifespan in healthy adult premenopausal women."The two researchers have collected more than 140,000 reports from people who say they've noticed a change in their periods after vaccination; Lee and Clancy are formally documenting those cases in an open-ended study.Clancy's interest was first piqued by her own experience."My period after dose one was one of the heaviest I remember having ever in my life," she says.She took to social media with her story, and five months later, people are still responding to her original tweet."I did not anticipate it blowing up to the extent that it has," Clancy says. "A lot of emails, a lot of Instagram DMs and a lot of tweets of people who are just baring their souls to us."The individual stories, even in large numbers, are not enough to prove vaccines are causing changes to menstruation. A healthy menstrual cycle is a complex hormonal process thatcan vary widely from person to person and month to monthand is affected by many factors.Stress can contributeto lighter or heavier periods, for example,as can medication, a recentswitch to a different form of birth control,or someherbal supplements.The Food and Drug Administration and all three manufacturers of COVID-19 vaccines authorized for emergency use in the U.S. tell NPR that they have not seen evidence that any of the vaccines cause menstrual irregularities —let alone causing any health problems related to menstruation or fertility. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says it is aware of the reports, but that vaccination is highly recommended and that there is no reason to schedule vaccination around periods or other menstrual events."Obstetrician-gynecologists and other women's health care practitioners should lead by example by being vaccinated and encouraging eligible patients to be vaccinated as well,"the association says.Nonetheless, the outpouring of interest and concern among people who menstruate points to a blind spot in the way that clinical research on the COVID-19 vaccines was done. As with many other vaccine trials, the earlyCOVID-19 studies did not ask much about reproductive health aside from questions around pregnancy. "It seeds doubt," Lee says. "It makes people feel like their bodies were not considered in part of the [clinical] trial."The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is giving the issue a closer look. A CDC spokesperson tells NPR that the agency is reviewing reports from one of its databases, called theVaccine Safety Datalink, to see whether it's possible to detect how the vaccine may affect menstruation.The stories collected by Lee and Clancy usually describe only brief disruptions to menstruation. "From what we have seen so far, it appears that the changes to the menstrual cycle seem to be short-lived, just a couple of cycles," Lee says.After vaccination, many people in the survey have reported heavy flows or bleeding at an unexpected time in the menstrual cycle, what's known asbreakthrough bleedingor spotting.This is what Lee went through after getting her first shot: spotting and cramping, "which for me is really, really unusual," she says. "I'm on the Mirena IUD so I normally don't experience a period."Lee says it wasn't particularly serious, but that the cramps were uncomfortable. Many people who have contacted the researchers for their survey reported similar changes, but others had different experiences."We started hearing a lot about breakthrough bleeding, from people on long-acting reversible contraception, people on gender-affirming hormones, and postmenopausal people who were years and years out from their last period, sometimes decades out," Lee says.Both researchers describe themselves as "pro-vaccine," especially given the dangers of COVID-19. Still they're troubled by the reports they've collected that some people are having their concerns dismissed out of hand by doctors. That's the sort of dismissiveness that can seed mistrust, Lee and Clancy note, and it's happening in part, they believe, because changes to menstruation are not officially listed as a possible side effect.Rumors of menstruation problemshave also fed larger conspiracy theories, and Lee says that further undermines the vaccines' credibility in some circles. "It seeds distrust, because it's not expected," she says.Even if the disruption to the menstrual cycle is minor and transient, people taking the vaccine have a right to know if it might temporarily alter their cycle, so research determining that once and for all should be done, saysAlice Lu-Culligan, an MD-Ph.D. candidate who studies immunology and reproductive health at Yale University: "That's a very simple question that they deserve to have an answer to," she says. "But at this time we really don't have an understanding of those changes."The multitude of stories represents just a small fraction of the many tens of millions of people who have been vaccinated against COVID-19. Most have not experienced changes to menstruation, including women in the clinical trials, according to statements to NPR from Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson."We haven't really heard much concern about menstrual issues," saysDr. Kathryn Edwards, a professor at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine who sits on an independent data monitoring committee for the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine and is paid by the company for that work.Edwards says the clinical trials would have picked up any issues that were truly dangerous. For example,researchers were able to detectan extremely rare and dangerous side effect, known as "thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome," that sometimes caused incidental changes to menstruation. "If it were leading to hospitalizations and severe illness, we would capture that," she says.But she acknowledges that relatively minor or unusually rare changes to menstruation might be missed. Participants in the clinical trials are handed a checklist asking about minor side effects such as headaches or arm soreness, but Edwards says there aren't any specific questions such as, "Are your menstrual periods irregular? Is your flow heavier?"Because this data isn't collected, trial participants are left to report changes to menstruation as "adverse events'' — a situation that could cause the trials to miss relatively minor disruptions, she said.Lee, one of the anthropologists studying the effect of the vaccines on menstruation, says she doesn't think she would personally describe her breakthrough bleeding as an "adverse event."New research does suggest there's at least a plausible route by which vaccines could alter menstruation. Yale's Lu-Culligan says that recent studies show immune cells play a role in both building up and breaking down the uterine lining during a cycle."When you're altering your immunological state with a vaccine, it's certainly possible that you could be altering a bit of the normal dynamics you could have," she says.But proving whether or not it's possible the vaccine could cause a minor menstrual disruption is difficult because periods can be so variable from person to person and cycle to cycle, saysDr. Laura Riley, chair of obstetrics and gynecology at New York-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center in New York City."The menstrual cycle itself is just so incredibly difficult to study, because there are so many other things that may impact it," Riley says.Factors such as stress or minor illness can change the duration of a period or the amount of bleeding, and some people have irregular cycles all the time. Moreover, what constitutes a "heavy" period varies from person to person and is highly subjective. "Just even thinking about how you would design that study to me is mind-boggling," Riley says.Edwards says the COVID-19 vaccine posed an especially difficult challenge for drugmakers. As the companies hurried to test the vaccines last year, safety monitors were focusing all their energy on spotting truly dangerous side effects. "I want people to understand that we're not blowing them off," Edwards says, "but we have some priorities that we have to have."The CDC says exploratory work to look into the issue is now underway, although the agency did not offer a timeline for when, or even if, a full study could be conducted.But even if the question can't be answered for COVID-19 vaccines, Riley says she believes issues such as the effects on menstruation need to be addressed in future clinical trials of drugs and vaccines: "Because when you can't answer those questions, you're asking people just to believe."An earlier version of the web story incorrectly described the three COVID-19 vaccines available for use in the United States as U.S.-approved. In fact, they have been authorized for emergency use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.An earlier version of the web story incorrectly described the three COVID-19 vaccines available for use in the United States as U.S.-approved.

Her daughter, Nancy, (left) is newly vaccinated. Her son, Dr. Edward Kenyi, is lobbying his "mum" to agree to the inoculation.Nancy Luka, Edward Kenyihide captionElizabeth (in purple), who lives in South Sudan, is undecided about getting a COVID vaccine. She's heard rumors that make her think it's not a good idea. Her daughter, Nancy, (left) is newly vaccinated. Her son, Dr. Edward Kenyi, is lobbying his "mum" to agree to the inoculation.Vaccines are not readily available in many countries. Yet when a limited supply does arrive, people are not always interested. On March 25,South Sudan received 132,000 doses of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccinethrough the COVAX program, the global effort to provide vaccines to poorer countries. They were free to all comers. But there was no rush to get the vaccines. As of August 3,only 56,989 vaccine doses have been administeredin country of approximately 12 million people. South Sudan returned some 72,000 doses to COVAX, which were shipped to Kenya instead. South Sudanese physician Edward Kenyi, now living in the U.S., plans to send this letter to his mother, Elizabeth, who's reluctant to take the vaccine, to try and change her mind.Dear Mum,The last time I called you on the phone a few weeks ago, you told me you were yet to take the COVID-19 vaccine. Although I have been telling you to take it for weeks, you said you are still waiting for the right time.I hope this letter will persuade you once and for all that the time is right now.Mum, since the beginning of the pandemic, when cases were rising in South Sudan and many people were dying of COVID-19, I implored you to take the necessary precautions to avoid catching the disease. You're in your 70s, which puts you among the most vulnerable groups of people at risk of getting seriously ill ... and of dying.Before the vaccines were invented, you told me you heard messages broadcast over the radio every day and saw many big posters on the streets advising all to wash their hands often, use face masks and practice physical distancing to stay healthy.Every time I spoke to you, you were either going to a funeral for a relative or returning from the marriage ceremony of another. You said even at these funerals and marriages, they talked about precautions.You told me that at some of the funerals you attended, no one would declare the cause of death – but that many people suspected COVID-19.In those early months of the pandemic, you seemed to take the disease seriously. You were concerned about me in America, where the disease was affecting many people, and advised me to be very careful.However, with time you have stopped taking the disease seriously. You told me you heard the disease is no longer a threat in Juba, where you live, because the number of people testing positive or dying from it has declined. I know that this is not true. Here's what the numbers say. As of the end of July 2021, there have been 11,090 confirmed cases of COVID-19 with 120 deaths, reported to the World Health Organization.And when I've urged you to avoid going to funerals for the time being to avoid exposure to the virus, or to at least wear your face mask, you told me that people you know say Black people are immune in general — and if they're not, they do not get serious disease.Mum, as a medical doctor and a public health physician who spends my days raising awareness about the pandemic, I feel pained that you are not following the simple steps that we advocate. Why do you trust the rumors and stories from WhatsApp group messages more than your own son? I wonder why my messages are not resonating with you and many members of my family.The growing toll of COVID-19 has not had any impact. Even when lockdowns were initiated in Juba, you still felt compelled to go to funerals, telling me it would look bad if you did not show up.Now that a vaccine against the virus that causes COVID-19 has been developed and found to be very effective in preventing the disease, you are not convinced that you should be vaccinated. Remember the last discussion we had? I told you I had completed my vaccine doses. You were surprised that I took the vaccine what with all the wild rumors circulating about it in the country.Mum, how can you believe the stories that the vaccines cause infertility? You also told me someone mentioned to you that Bill Gates is implanting microchips into Africans in order to control them — and that you have seen the video of a key sticking like a magnet to the arm of someone who was vaccinated.There is no evidence that any of these things are true. Whoever is responsible for developing and circulating these stories is going to hurt millions of people.How can I convince you that as a medical professional, I believe in vaccines, which are safe and effective against the virus? The rumors you hear every day are just that: rumors. There is no shred of evidence to support them.Let me tell you these facts, again: The vaccines are effective and very safe. Even though the percentage of Africans who have been vaccinated is low due to lack of supply, millions of African people have already taken the vaccine, and they're doing fine. The few reports about side effects like blood clots and severe reactions are minimal, compared to the protections you will get from being vaccinated.I was thrilled that when I told my little sister that I was vaccinated, she went ahead and got her vaccine. I was excited that at last, someone is stepping forward to show you that it is possible safe to take the vaccine and be protected. She had no complaints arising from the vaccines. Shouldn't this fact help you make up your mind?Mum, the vaccines are free of charge. It is the best protection for you at your age, and you should seriously consider taking the shot. Vaccines prevented us from the childhood illnesses you feared years ago. And the new COVID vaccines will keep us safe from this new plague. Why would you trust those vaccines then and not these? The COVID vaccines, like the childhood vaccines, have been tested to make sure they are effective and safe. Safety has always been the marker for bringing any vaccine to the public.Mum, I am appealing to you to rethink your stand and take the step to take the vaccine. Once vaccinated, you will be safe. And, you won't have to endure any more of my pestering — we can talk about whatever you want to!Take the jab, mum.Sincerely,Your son,EdwardBorn and raised in South Sudan, and now living in Baltimore, Edward Kenyi is a medical doctor working as a technical adviser for Jhpiego, a Johns Hopkins University global health affiliate. As a member of the South Sudanese Health Professional Association, he participates in live webinars on various online streaming platforms to raise awareness on COVID-19 prevention and debunk myths surrounding vaccines globally and within his community in the U.S.Your turn: Share Your LettersIf this story inspired you to write a personal letter to a vaccine-hesitant family member or loved one, we'd love for you to share it with us.

Scott Simon40% of robocalls reportedly are scams.PhotoAlto/Antoine Arraou/Getty Images/PhotoAltohide caption40% of robocalls reportedly are scams.Busy week? I had news meetings, family stuff, and interviews, of course. And then I got a call from an officious, digitized voice that said they were the IRS. It informed me they've noticed suspicious activity on my account. Not a good start to the day.Soon, more bad news. A call from a similar-sounding robo-voice — maybe they're siblings — said they've noticed suspicious activity on my credit card account.But good news, a minute later: a peppy, friendly, recorded voice, told me my spotless driving record entitled me to receive a great new deal on car insurance.Then I remembered: I have no driving record. I have no driver's license, although that did not discourage another genial recorded voice who called a few minutes later to offer a great new deal on a car warranty because of my immaculate driving history.By the way, I also have spotless record in performing brain surgery.I take no poetic license when I say that on any given day, I get dozens of calls to say that I've won a vacation, a home alarm system, or discounts on scores of pharmaceuticals. I get calls to warn me of suspicious activities on my Social Security or credit card accounts, and calls imploring me to donate to groups that sound faintly familiar, but are likely just cleverly monikered scams. 40% of robocalls reportedly are.Spam is a unifier in these times of partisan divides. A survey conducted by Business Insider this year reports that 80% of Democrats say they received spam calls, 79% of Republicans, and equal percentages of men and women, rich and poor.46% of Americans surveyed said they received spam calls every day. But like the weather and infrastructure legislation, nobody seems to know what to do about it. Software can dial thousands of random numbers in seconds. All scammers need is a few to answer.But it struck me this week that there may be something especially inconsiderate about these calls during these times. More of us are working at home. So many of us feel isolated and anxious, especially on a week like this, whenmasks are back,infections are on the rise, and the pandemic can seem unremitting. The ring of the phone can be piercing. We answer, whatever the number, because we worry it could be vital news about family or friends. Or we answer for a chance to hear another human voice. Press pound if you're feeling a little lonely, anxious, or overwhelmed.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Selena Simmons-DuffinA data scientist working in tech, Michael Donnelly became an amateur COVID-19 watcher early in the pandemic. When his vaccinated friends started getting sick following July Fourth festivities in Provincetown, Mass., he documented more than 50 breakthrough cases that ultimately led the CDC to changing its guidance on masking.Jason LeCras for NPRhide captionA data scientist working in tech, Michael Donnelly became an amateur COVID-19 watcher early in the pandemic. When his vaccinated friends started getting sick following July Fourth festivities in Provincetown, Mass., he documented more than 50 breakthrough cases that ultimately led the CDC to changing its guidance on masking.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has a lot of ways to pick up on COVID-19 outbreaks, but those methods often take awhile to bear fruit.Not so with the Provincetown, Mass., cluster that started around July Fourth weekend. "We triggered the investigation as people were getting symptomatic," says Demetre Daskalakis, a deputy incident manager for the CDC's COVID-19 Response. "Pretty amazing — it is warp speed."How did they do that? It was thanks to a tip from a citizen scientist named Michael Donnelly. A data scientist in New York City's tech sector, he started publishing his own coronavirus data reports early in the pandemic and launched a website,COVIDoutlook.info, with Drexel University epidemiologist Michael LeVasseur.Following leads from his personal network, Donnelly documented over 50 breakthrough cases coming out of Provincetown, practically in real time, and shared it with the CDC as the outbreak was still unfolding.Without Donnelly's effort, the agency would have probably detected the outbreak at some point, Daskalakis says, but "it wouldn't have been as rapturous an initiation of an investigation and response as we had."The speed of the investigation — and the exceptional participation from the mostly gay men involved in the outbreak — helped the CDC learn new information about the delta variant. And it was that new information, in part, that prompted the agency to change its guidance for how vaccinated people should keep themselves safe at this stage of the pandemic — including a return to masking indoors.It's a testament to the power of citizens engaging with the scientific process, Daskalakis says. "I get goose bumps thinking about it," he says. "Community plus public health is magic."Donnelly didn't go to Provincetown with his husband for July Fourth, but his friends who were there told him all about it. As they do every year, thousands of gay men arrived for the holiday in this little artist community on the tip of Cape Cod to rent cottages, go to the beach and drag shows and restaurants, and crowd into nightclubs to dance.Fourth of July festivities in Provincetown resulted in an outbreak among vaccinated and unvaccinated attendees. The delta variant was later determined to be the most prevalent strain of the virus involved in the outbreak.Craig F. Walker/The Boston Globe via Getty Imageshide captionFourth of July festivities in Provincetown resulted in an outbreak among vaccinated and unvaccinated attendees. The delta variant was later determined to be the most prevalent strain of the virus involved in the outbreak.As the festivities from the July Fourth week wrapped up, the updates and gossip streaming into Donnelly's phone quickly took a different cast from years' past.On July 9, he texted some close friends, "[D]id you boys survive the Fourth in P-town?" The response: "Our entire house can't stop coughing."More texts started coming in, including from fully vaccinated friends testing positive for the coronavirus. He started thinking to himself, he says, that given that vaccination rates were really high among the gay community and in Provincetown, "the odds don't really add up."With the pandemic keeping friends apart for so long, there was extra excitement this year, says Zorik Pesochinsky, who traveled to Provincetown from New York City. "The lines were even longer — the bars were even busier and more full," he says.He and everyone else he knew going were fully vaccinated, so he felt safe. "I was definitely going into it with a mindset of, this is all behind us, we're just going into a super-fun, amazing weekend."It was a rainy week, which meant everyone was indoors more. "It would get so incredibly hot in these clubs that you would just be wet with sweat, so you'd have to step outside for a moment just to get a breath of fresh air," says Sean Holihan, who came from Washington, D.C.Halfway through the week, when a few of Cameron Thomas' vacation housemates started coughing, he didn't think much of it. "You're saying hi to so many people, you're in situations where you don't sleep a lot, you're running around — you're going to catch something," he says.But it wasn't a summer cold that was going around. By the end of that week, news of breakthrough COVID-19 cases started to roll in. And they kept coming.As the texts from his friends rolled in, Donnelly's statistician side took over — he wanted to understand what was going on."That's what's always drawing me to numbers and math and forecasting and data science — it gives me some better idea of the things that I understand and the things that I can control and the things that I can't," he says.He knew that breakthrough infections were expected, that no vaccine is 100% effective. But the numbers he was hearing about exceeded what he would have expected the breakthrough rate to be."What was really concerning about this was it sounded like entire houses were coming down with breakthrough infections," he says. "That full allotment of people that I know that I would expect over the course of this year to get a breakthrough infection were getting a breakthrough infection in a single week."He spent the next few days reaching friends and acquaintances from all over the country and taking notes on their COVID-19 statuses and symptoms and vaccination histories and more."Michael's known as the COVID data guy," Pesochinsky says. "When he started asking about it, I was like, 'Oh, this makes a lot of sense that he's going to be pulling something together.' "As soon as Holihan tested positive, he shared it publicly. "I posted on Instagram and Twitter that I had tested positive for COVID and the people who had cold symptoms, who had been in P-town, they should also get tested," he says. "And then I emailed or messaged every person that I could remember coming in contact with and just said, 'Hey, heads up, I have COVID.' " Donnelly saw his tweet and called him up, too.Between myself and others, I know of nearly 30 breakthrough cases of Covid that came from visiting Provincetown for the 4th of July. In each and every situation, the symptoms were mild and no one required a hospital visit.The vaccine works.The men Donnelly was calling were eager to help. After a few days, he had collected information on 51 cases, including COVID-19 and vaccination statuses, symptoms, home city, phone number, whether they were in a house with other breakthrough cases, and more.It's no accident, Donnelly says, that his friends were so open. "The norms of the gay community say: Share your medical history, share your risks with other people so that they can be responsible and take care of themselves as well," he says. "That came with years of practice within the community, particularly around HIV and AIDS."That willingness to share information about health and contacts is not a given. Contact tracing COVID-19 in the U.S. has hada lot of problems throughout the pandemic. With a fragmented public health system, tracing outbreaks across jurisdictions has been one challenge. Getting people to report their close contacts and where they were has been another. One CDC report found thattwo-thirds of people intervieweddid not provide any contacts to a contact tracer.After three days of gathering this information together, Donnelly decided it was time to call in the public health professionals.If you were in Provincetown over the last couple of weeks and are experiencing symptoms of COVID-19, please consider getting tested regardless of your vaccination status.PCR tests are more accurate than rapid tests, but getting both is also a great option if it's available.https://t.co/HjWSPOZrMKAs it happened, Donnelly knew the CDC's Daskalakis from the previous year when Daskalakis worked for New York City's health department and Donnelly was putting out his coronavirus forecasts.Donnelly texted Daskalakis to let him know what he was finding on July 12. Daskalakis asked him to email the spreadsheet and responded the next day, connecting him to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health and other CDC officials."It's quite certain that if we didn't have the heads-up from Michael — because of what he was seeing among his friends with his statistician hat on — we wouldn't have heard about it as rapidly," Daskalakis says.Donnelly soon got a call from the Massachusetts state epidemiologist, Dr. Catherine Brown, "who wanted to know as much as I could tell her," he says. "She had already been aware of some breakthrough cases, but among Massachusetts residents." The spreadsheet gave her a head start in identifying cases connected to Provincetown in cities all over the country.Donnelly says it's no accident that his friends were so eager to help, sharing information about their vaccination statuses, symptoms, and whether they were in a house with other breakthrough cases. "The norms of the gay community say: Share your medical history, share your risks with other people so that they can be responsible and take care of themselves as well," he says.Jason LeCras for NPRhide captionDonnelly says it's no accident that his friends were so eager to help, sharing information about their vaccination statuses, symptoms, and whether they were in a house with other breakthrough cases. "The norms of the gay community say: Share your medical history, share your risks with other people so that they can be responsible and take care of themselves as well," he says.On calls with public health officials, Donnelly says he and LeVasseur tried to explain, not just their spreadsheet and analysis, but the context of what Provincetown is like during these annual gay pilgrimage weeks."Even for us — even for gay men who have been in the gay nightlife scene for years and years, it's not the easiest thing in the world to go to a meeting with 10 CDC epidemiology experts and explain the intricacies ofCircuit Week versus Bear Weekand just how many hundreds of people they can squeeze into those spaces with terrible music," Donnelly laughs. "I've been telling my friends, you haven't lived until you've talked about twinks with the CDC."In a way, this was an auspicious community to be at the center of an outbreak investigation. The people affected didn't just cooperate when a friend called asking questions — they helped public health officials who called as well."I heard in one of those early meetings that the contact tracers had reported back and they said, 'These are the most cooperative people we've ever worked with — we have people giving us their entire itineraries and the names and phone numbers of everybody that were in their house,' " Donnelly says.Gay men's relationship to public health has been "tempered by fire because of HIV," the CDC's Daskalakis says. "This is an awesome public health moment," he says. "It's a community that believes in science and public health stepping up to the plate."The result of the CDC's investigation with the Barnstable County and Massachusetts health departments was areport published on July 30. By the time it was released, news of this unusual outbreak was already out. CDC Director Rochelle Walenskyhad alluded to itearlier in the week as evidence to support changes in the agency's recommendations on what wassafe for fully vaccinated peopleto do.The findings of the investigation were striking. Out of 469 positive cases identified, nearly three-quarters of cases were in fully vaccinated people. Delta was determined to be the culprit in these cases, not older strains or some new variant. And — most surprisingly — the amount of virus measured in a subset of people who tested positive was nearly identical among vaccinated and unvaccinated people.These findings "raised the specter of — is there transmission happening from vaccinated person to vaccinated person? Is the Delta variant a bigger threat from the perspective of transmissibility and vaccine effectiveness?" Daskalakis says. He describes the findings as an "exclamation point" that prompted the agency to change its guidance for what was safe for vaccinated people to do in the context of delta.Daskalakis says the investigation into this cluster is ongoing. "The next phase will be going into a deeper dive into the various aspects of this outbreak, including what happened outside of Massachusetts," he says.Donnelly says he's proud of how his community responded to the investigators, and thankful that public health officials listened and wanted to understand."I was just the concentrator of this information," he says. It was the way the community responded, he says, that "allowed the CDC to learn something important about the new coronavirus, and — I really hope — protect some folks."Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Scott NeumanA United Airlines jetliner taxis down a runway for take off from Denver International Airport last month. The carrier has become the first major U.S. airline to require employees be vaccinated against COVID-19.David Zalubowski/APhide captionA United Airlines jetliner taxis down a runway for take off from Denver International Airport last month. The carrier has become the first major U.S. airline to require employees be vaccinated against COVID-19.United Airlines has told its 67,000 U.S.-based employees that they will need to be inoculated against COVID-19 by late October to stay on the job.Citing"incredibly compelling" evidencethat the vaccines are safe and effective, United CEO Scott Kirby announced the policy change on Friday. He said he understood that some employees would disagree with the mandate, according to The Associated Press.The requirement is that all U.S. domestic employees of the airline be fully vaccinated by Oct. 25 — or five weeks from the date that any one vaccine gets full approval from the Food and Drug Administration, whichever comes first.United is the first major U.S. carrier to require vaccination, although its decision follows similar moves by a number of other companies, includingWalmart, with more than 2 million employees, andTyson Foods, which has 120,000 employees. Others includeFacebook, Disney andMicrosoft.On the other hand, American Airline CEO Doug Parker has toldThe New York Timesthat "we're not putting mandates in place."The Air Line Pilots Association, which represents United's pilots, did not immediately respond to an NPR request for comment. However, on Thursday, the president of the Allied Pilots Association, which represents American's 15,000 pilots, reiterated the union's position on mandatory vaccines."APA's position remains the same: Whether a pilot elects to be vaccinated, or not, should be between the pilot and their medical provider, while any proposed vaccine mandate affecting our pilots would be subject to collective bargaining," APA President Eric Ferguson said in a letter to members that was shared with NPR.Ferguson said that about 60% of the union's pilots had already opted to be vaccinated and encouraged its members to do so."We all want to put the COVID-19 pandemic behind us, and most of the scientific community agrees that vaccination provides a path to achieving that aim," he said.In May, Delta Air Lines began requiring all new hires to show proof of vaccination, and United followed suit the following month.By contrast, American Airline CEO Doug Parker toldThe New York Timesthat "we're not putting mandates in place," the APA says.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Dustin JonesA health care worker in Rhode Island receives a dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine last December. California is implementing a vaccine mandate for all paid and unpaid workers in the health care industry starting Sept. 30.David Goldman/APhide captionA health care worker in Rhode Island receives a dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine last December. California is implementing a vaccine mandate for all paid and unpaid workers in the health care industry starting Sept. 30.California is implementing what it calls the "first in the nation" requirement that health care workers statewide be vaccinated against COVID-19.The state is currently experiencing its fastest increase in coronavirus cases since the onset of the pandemic, with case rates "increasing ninefold in the last two months," according tothe new orderfrom the California Department of Public Health.The CDPH wants to protect the state's vulnerable populations and to keep health care facilities operating steadily across the state. Under the order, which was announced Thursday and took effect the same day, paid and unpaid workers in health care facilities have until Sept. 30 to be fully vaccinated. The order applies to those who provide services or work in hospitals, nursing facilities, psychiatric hospitals, clinics and doctor's offices. It also includes dialysis centers and residential substance use treatment centers and at least a half-dozen other facilities.Oregon Gov. Kate Brown announced this week that she plans toimplement a similar measure. "Brown announced Wednesday she's directed the Oregon Health Authority to create new rules designed to apply pressure on health care workers. They can either get vaccinated by Sept. 30 or face frequent tests for the virus," member station Oregon Public Broadcasting reported.In California, 63% of residents 12 years or older have been fully vaccinated and another 10% have had at least one dose as of Thursday, the CDPH said. But the rapid rise of the delta variant is troubling state health officials."Increasing numbers of health care workers are among the new positive cases, despite vaccinations being prioritized for this group when vaccines initially became available," the CDPH said. "Recent outbreaks in health care settings have frequently been traced to unvaccinated staff members."Facilities requiring vaccination will have to verify the status of their staff and have a plan for monitoring who has and has not gotten jabbed. Proof of vaccination can come in the form of a COVID-19 vaccine record card, health care documents or digital records accessible by a QR code or from documentation from another employer requiring vaccination. If a person can't prove they've gotten a full dose, facilities will have to assume they're unvaccinated.There are, however, two exceptions: religious beliefs or a qualified medical condition. Staff who refuse to get the vaccine based on either will be excused. Those pursuing the medical exemption don't need to disclose their condition but do need to provide a written statement by a medical professional attesting to their inability to receive the vaccine and for how long. Unvaccinated workers will have to be tested for COVID-19 as often as twice a week and must wear a respirator or surgical mask at all times while at work.California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced the order over Twitter on Thursday.  Some people cheered the news, while others wondered what would happen if enough staff refused to take the shot and instead chose to walk out.NEW: California will now require workers in healthcare settings to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 by September 30th.More than150 employees quit or were firedfrom their jobs at a Houston hospital system after being presented with a similar ultimatum. And the nation is already facing a health care worker crisis. A Kaiser Family Foundation study found that3 in 10 medical professionalsare considering leaving their jobs because of pandemic burnout.Even as California's mandate took effect, some states are doing everything in their power to prevent vaccine requirements and have passed legislationoutlawing mandates.The U.S. is seeing more than90,000 new infections per day, the highest daily rate since mid-February. With delta on the rise, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is forecasting as many as9,100 new coronavirus deathsby late August.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Dalia FaheidCredit:Felicia Croft/Willis-Knighton Medical Center/ StoryfulA year and a half into the pandemic, Louisiana is now facing its worst surge of coronavirus yet — and health care workers are once again overwhelmed."I can't explain the feeling of defeat when you pour everything into a patient and it's not enough," Felicia Croft, who works as an ICU nurse in Shreveport, says in a recent video diary in her car. It's been one of the hardest days for her since the pandemic began, she says."And then to know that they could've gotten vaccinated and it could've made a difference," Croft said.Louisiana health officials say the delta variant is driving the new surge in hospitalizations, especially among people who are not vaccinated. At the Willis-Knighton Health System, where Croft works,77 of the 88 peoplehospitalized were unvaccinated as of Friday."People are younger and sicker" with the delta variant, she said. Croft, 35, said patients her age or even younger are dying.Croft recounted a heart-wrenching moment with her 14-year-old daughter, Macy, when Macy asked Croft to pray for her friend's parents who are in the hospital's ICU with COVID-19."To know that my daughter might come to me when she gets that call and say, 'Mom, why didn't you save them?' I cannot even explain how that feels, as a nurse and as a mom," Croft said.Croft tells NPR's Steve Inskeep onMorning Editionthat she recorded the video after a really difficult day: "My kids are hurting for their friends. And that just made this day much harder and really made me just need to get some feelings out."In the video, Croft holds back tears thinking that moms like her will miss out on their children's milestones — seeing their kids graduate or meeting their grandchildren. Or that their children could become orphaned."More often than not, when they come in and they're admitted and they can't breathe and we're talking about ventilators, they're saying, 'I wish I would have gotten the shot,' " Croft tells NPR.But the pace of vaccinations in Louisiana is now picking up, which Croft says is good news. It's been "incredible" to see people's "change in mindset and how they didn't know it was quite this serious or they were ignorant until it's affected someone they loved. And I want people to see that this is real and that there's help before it hurts someone they love."Jesse Johnson, Miranda Kennedy and Tekella Foster produced and edited the audio interview.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Joe HernandezDeepa ShivaramStudents return to school at Seminole Heights Elementary in Tampa on Aug. 31, 2020, after the Florida Department of Education mandated in-class learning.Octavio Jones/Getty Imageshide captionStudents return to school at Seminole Heights Elementary in Tampa on Aug. 31, 2020, after the Florida Department of Education mandated in-class learning.A battle is brewing in Florida over whether students will have to wear masks when they return to the classroom this fall.Several Florida school districts are keeping their mask mandates in place for the upcoming school year,despite anexecutive orderby Gov. Ron DeSantis that leaves it up to parents to decide whether their children wear face coverings in school. School boards that don't eliminate mask mandates could face the loss of  state funding.On Friday, Florida's Board of Education further complicated matters for public schools by announcing they would provide private school vouchers for parents who see mask-wearing requirements as "harrassment" of their children.Thenew rulesays a public school student who is subject to "COVID-19 harassment" which can include mask and COVID testing requirements, is eligible for a Hope Scholarship, which would allow the child to transfer to a private school or a public school in a different district.South Florida's Broward County Public Schools, the second-largest district in Florida, cited safety as its top priority announcing the decision tomaintain its mask requirementpending further guidance from the state as coronavirus cases surge in Florida.The Sunshine State has seen a rash of new COVID-19 infections in recent weeks. On Saturday, it recorded 21,683 new coronavirus cases, itshighest single-day totalsince the pandemic began.But DeSantis, a Republican, said that because vaccines are now prevalent, the decision to mask students should be up to their parents — not the school district."I want to empower parents to be able to make the best decisions they can for the well-being of their children,"DeSantis said.  He said parents are in the best position to evaluate "the effect that this would have on their children."DeSantis citeda study, conducted in part by Brown University researcher Emily Oster, that did not find "a correlation between mask mandates and COVID-19 rates" in schools in Florida, New York and Massachusetts. Other researchershave pointed out that the study had a big caveat: The data didnt look at whether students contracted COVID-19 in or outside of school.Oster herself has said that the data sets were collected before the spread of the hyper-transmissible delta variant,according to The Associated Press.The Centers for Disease Control and Preventionrecommendsthat all students, staff and faculty who are not fully vaccinated against the coronavirus wear a mask indoors. Children under 12 are still not approved for the vaccine in the United States."When it comes to safety, we know that adherence to the mitigation strategies works," U.S. Education Secretary Miguel Cardona said ina recent interview with NPR."I know that there are some folks making decisions that are less based on science and more on their ideology. But at the end of the day, our educators, their job is to make sure our students are OK," he added.The executive order does not prohibit mask mandates outright, but it gives parents the final say as to whether their child would have to wear a face covering in school. No children would be prohibited from wearing a mask if they chose to."We are finalizing health and education emergency rules this week that do not prohibit masks in schools but will require parents to have the right to opt their children out. School districts will be expected to allow parents to make this choice," DeSantis' press secretary, Christina Pushaw, said in a statement."[I]t has to be the parent's free choice. Requiring medical documentation to opt out of the mask mandate, for example, would violate the spirit of the EO," she added.The executive order says Florida could withhold public funds from "noncompliant school boards" that violate the new requirement.Duval County announcedon Thursday that it will require any student not wearing a mask indoors to opt out of the district's policy. Officials inAlachua County votedto require students to wear face coverings for the first two weeks of school."We applaud the school boards of Alachua and Duval counties for following the advice of doctors in their community,"said the Florida Education Association, the state's largest teachers union. "We believe every county should be empowered to make decisions on how best to keep their students safe in consultation with local health experts and based on the unique needs and circumstances in their area."Orange County schoolswill mandate masks for staff— but not students — for 30 days.Ina letterto DeSantis, Leon County Schools Superintendent Rocky Hanna said he wanted to impose a temporary mask mandate in grades pre-K through 8 to protect students and staff against the delta variant, which is spreading quickly across the country and in Florida. Leon County includes Tallahassee, the state capital."I'm asking you to allow us the flexibility and the autonomy to make the decisions for our schools that best fit our local data and information in Leon County," Hanna said.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Josie FischelsFed up with a group of demonstrators protesting mandatory COVID-19 vaccinations, New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy lashed out on Wednesday during a public bill signing."These folks back there have lost their minds — you've lost your minds," Murphy said, calling out to the protesters. "You are the ultimate knuckleheads, and because of what you are saying and standing for, people are losing their life. People are losing their life and you have to know that. Look in the mirror."The governor had come to Union City to sign legislation that would allocate money to prevent evictions and give utility assistance.Murphy said on Monday that around 80% of positive tests in New Jersey between July 12 and 19 were from people who were not vaccinated or not fully vaccinated. Nearly 60% of people in the state are fully vaccinated.New Jersey's confirmed COVID-19 cases are on the rise. The state reported1,345 new caseson Thursday,the highest single-day total in nearly three months.In line with the CDC's latest mask guidance, Murphy has encouraged all people in New Jersey to wear a mask indoors in areas of high transmission regardless of vaccination status. Accordingto NJ.com, only one of New Jersey's 21 counties does not have high or substantial transmission rates.Josie Fischels is an intern on NPR's News Desk.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Vanessa Romo"We have three vaccines that work and are readily available, so what's it going to take?," said Los Angeles City Council President Nury Martinez.Marcio Jose Sanchez/APhide caption"We have three vaccines that work and are readily available, so what's it going to take?," said Los Angeles City Council President Nury Martinez.Los Angeles' unvaccinated may soon be banned from entering a slew of indoor public spaces, as the city copes with another wave of rapidly risingCOVID-19cases and hospitalizations.City lawmakers on Wednesday introduced a sort of "no shots, no service" vaccine mandate, followingin the footsteps of New York City, which is the first major city to impose such a mandate.In Los Angeles, the new law would require anyone 16 and over who is eligible, to show proof of at least one inoculation shot before stepping into restaurants, bars, retail stores, gyms, spas, movie theaters, concert venues and sporting events."Enough is enough already," Council President Martinez, who proposed the motion alongside Council member Mitch O'Farrell, said in a statement. "Hospital workers are exhausted, moms who have put aside their careers are tired, and our kids cannot afford the loss of another school year."She added: "We have three vaccines that work and are readily available, so what's it going to take? Our kids are about to return to school and the unvaccinated are putting their lives at risk every day. Ask your questions, talk to your doctor, and get the vaccine. Let's put this behind us."The Los Angeles proposal comes a day after New York City announced it would require aspiring customers and/or bon vivants to show their paper copy of the CDC vaccine card or provide electronic proof via the city's Excelsior app. The mandate goes into effect on Aug. 16.Similarly, San Francisco health officials announced on Tuesday that they are also "exploring" implementing similar vaccination-verification requirements.It is an appealing solution for local leaders across the country who are desperately trying to fend off another, more severe wave of cases triggered by the highly contagiousdelta variant. As NPR hasreported, the delta mutation appears to be around twice as transmissible as the original SARS-CoV-2 strains. But research shows that COVID-19 vaccines still provide strong protection against it.In Los Angeles, where roughly90% of COVID-19 patientsin local hospitals are unvaccinated people, the latest surge in cases has prompted thousands to roll up their sleeves.TheLA Timesreports, providers administered nearly 44,000 first doses per day from July 25 to 31. As of Wednesday,71.7%of LA County residents 16 and older have been vaccinated with at least one dose.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

Asa Hutchinson stands next to a chart displaying COVID-19 hospitalization data as he speaks at a news conference at the state Capitol in Little Rock, Ark., Thursday, July 29, 2021.Months after he signed the bill banning state and local mask mandates, Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson says he wants the law reversed to give schools the option to require face coverings when children return to the classroom."In hindsight, I wish that it had not become law. But it is the law, and the only chance we have is either to amend it or for the courts to say that it has an unconstitutional foundation," he said at aTuesday news conference.Hutchinson has called a special session for the state legislature to change the law. During the news conference, he and Secretary of Health Jose Romero stressed that children under 12 are currently the most vulnerable group in the state because they are unable to get the vaccine."As of August 1st of this year, nearly 19% of all active cases are in children under 18 years of age. Those children that cannot have a vaccine at this point ... account for more than half of that percentage," Romero said.The governor said he had signed the bill banning mask mandates in April because cases in Arkansas were low. The state hadreported only 44 new cases on April 5."I knew it would be overridden by the legislature if I didn't sign it, and I had already eliminated our statewide mask mandate. Everything has changed now," Hutchinson said.Now, the state's public health emergency has been reinstated.

Jason BeaubienThe director of WHO now says that a booster moratorium should be in force until 10% of the population in all countries is vaccinated. Israel had previously announced plans to give a third Pfizer dose to residents age 60 and up after an uptick in COVID cases. Above: Administering a booster on August 2 in Tel Aviv.Kobi Wolf/Bloomberg via Getty Imageshide captionThe director of WHO now says that a booster moratorium should be in force until 10% of the population in all countries is vaccinated. Israel had previously announced plans to give a third Pfizer dose to residents age 60 and up after an uptick in COVID cases. Above: Administering a booster on August 2 in Tel Aviv.Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director general of the World Health Organization, is now calling for a moratorium – for at least the next two months – on COVID booster shots."We should not accept countries that have already used most of the global supply of vaccines, using even more of it," he says, "while the world's most vulnerable people remain unprotected."WHO is saying that people who are fully immunized against COVID should hold off on getting a third shot until more people around the world can get their first dose of a vaccine.It's a controversial stand in some quarters. White House press secretary Jen Psaki dismissed the call for a booster moratorium, saying that WHO is setting up a "false choice."The global inequity in vaccine availability cited by Tedros has been stark. More than 80% of COVID vaccines have been administered in high-income and upper-middle income nations. The United Kingdom, for example, has vaccinated nearly 65% of its population while just 7% of Filipinos are immunized. The U.S. is vaccinating teenagers at low risk of contracting COVID while front-line health-care workers in Nigeria are still awaiting their shots.And in a trend that's troubling to WHO, Israel has just started offering booster doses of Pfizer to people over 60. By contrast, in the Palestinian territories fewer than 12% of residents have gotten any vaccine at all.WHO isn't ruling out all boosters in the near future. The global health agency says boosters may be necessary for a small number of people with specific medical conditions. But studies haven't yet proven that booster shots would add significant protection right now to the general public, WHO notes. That's why Tedros is calling for a ban on boosters for at least two months to reach his target of getting 10% of people in every country vaccinated by September 30.Beyond that time frame, WHO's goal for global vaccination is 40% by the end of December and 70% by mid-2022. Yet with fewer than 2% of people in Africa fully vaccinated, the chances of hitting the first benchmark by October 1 is nearly impossible.If the Food and Drug Administration decides that boosters are appropriate, White House press secretary Psaki says the U.S. will provide these shots to Americans. She says the U.S. has enough supply to offer boosters at home and donate doses abroad. "We believe we can do both," Psaki says. "We don't need to make that choice."ButJarbas Barbosa, assistant director of the Pan American Health Organization, says from a public health perspective giving boosters in some countries ahead of first doses in others makes no sense. COVID boosters haven't yet won authorization from major regulatory bodies such as the FDA or WHO. Giving them right now, adds Barbosa, is "morally and ethically complicated."Ruth Karron, a professor of international health at Johns Hopkins University, agrees that in this phase of the pandemic vaccinating as many people as quickly as possible is more important than focusing on boosters."New variants are most likely to arise in unvaccinated populations," she says. "So the more of the world that's unvaccinated, the more we are all at risk."The Delta variant has shown how quickly progress against this pandemic can shift and how cases rise sharply even in countries with high vaccination rates."It should be the right of everyone in the world in the context of this pandemic to get vaccinated," says Karron. She recognizes that some people don't share her humanitarian approach to this issue but says even for people who care mainly about ending the pandemic here in the U.S., the goal should still be the same."It is in the best interest of the U.S. population to have as much global immunity as possible," she says, "because that's how we prevent new variants from arising."Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
The Associated PressPeople congregate at One-Eyed Jack's Saloon during last year's Sturgis Motorcycle Rally in South Dakota. The annual event was blamed for leading to a spike in COVID cases and it's being held again this year.Stephen Groves/APhide captionPeople congregate at One-Eyed Jack's Saloon during last year's Sturgis Motorcycle Rally in South Dakota. The annual event was blamed for leading to a spike in COVID cases and it's being held again this year.SIOUX FALLS, S.D. — Crowds of bikers are rumbling their way towards South Dakota's Black Hills this week, raising fears that COVID-19 infections will be unleashed among the 700,000 people expected to show up at the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally.The rally, which starts Friday, has become a haven for those eager to escape coronavirus precautions.Last year,the rally hardly slowed down, with roughly 460,000 people attending. Masks were mostly ditched as bikers crowded into bars, tattoo parlors and rock shows,offering a lessonin how massive gatherings could spread waves of the virus across the country.This year — the 81st iteration of the rally — is expected to be even bigger, drawing people from around the U.S. and beyond, despite concerns about the virus' highly contagious delta variant."It's great to see a party of hundreds of thousands of people," said Zoltán Vári, a rallygoer who was settling into his campsite Tuesday after making the trek from Hungary.He was eager to return to riding a Harley-Davidson through the Black Hills after missing last year. Vári evaded U.S. tourism travel restrictions on Europe by spending two weeks in Costa Rica before making his way to South Dakota. He hopes 1 million people will show up. Typical attendance is around a half a million.The city of Sturgis, usually a sleepy community of under 7,000, tried to tamp things down last year, canceling most city-sponsored events and promotion, but hordes of bikers showed up anyway."The rally is a behemoth, and you cannot stop it," said Carol Fellner, a local who worried that this year's event would cause a fresh outbreak of cases. "I feel absolutely powerless."This year, the city is embracing the crowds. Republican Gov. Kristi Noem has given the rally her blessing and will appear in a charity ride. The event is a boon for tourism, powering over $800 million in sales, according to the state Department of Tourism.The rally is happening as other giant summer events — from state fairs  to music festivals like Lollapalooza — are returning around the U.S. In Wisconsin, health officials say nearly 500 coronavirus cases may be linked to the crowds that attended Milwaukee Bucks games or gathered outside the team's arena — estimated as high as 100,000 one night — during their push to the NBA championship.The Sturgis Motorcycle Rally's defenders argue open air is plentiful on the meandering highways and in the campgrounds where many bikers stay, but contact tracers last year reported 649 virus cases from every corner of the country linked to the rally, including one death. A team from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded in a published study that the 2020 rally " had many characteristics of a superspreading event. "Rallygoers reasoned that after years of riding Harleys, the coronavirus was just another risk. Five motorcycle riders were killed in crashes during the 2020 rally, and one fatal crash has already been reported this year.The attitude was summed up on a T-shirt sold last year: "Screw COVID. I went to Sturgis."But public health experts warned the massive gathering revved the virus far beyond those who chose to attend. One team of economists argued that the rally set off a chain reaction that resulted in  250,000 cases nationwide. However, that paper was not peer reviewed and was criticized by some top epidemiologists — as well as some bikers — for overestimating the rally's impact.People fill a bar during the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally in South Dakota in August 2020.Stephen Groves/APhide captionPeople fill a bar during the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally in South Dakota in August 2020.While it's not clear how many cases can be blamed on last year's rally, it coincided with the start of a sharp increase across the Great Plains that ultimately crescendoed in a deadly winter.The gathering could potentially power a fresh wave of infections like the one that is currently shattering hospitalization records in parts of the South, said Dr. Michael Osterholm, the director of the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy."I understand how people want to move on from this pandemic — God knows I want to — but the reality is you can't ignore it," he said. "You can't just tell the virus you're done with it."The current rate of cases in South Dakota is roughly half of what it was in the days leading up to last year's rally. Deaths have also dropped significantly.COVID-19 vaccines provide hope the rally won't set off virus spread, but it's not clear how many in the Sturgis crowd have received a shot. Unlike events like Lollapalooza that required attendees to show proof of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test, precautions at Sturgis are minimal and optional. The biggest step the city has taken was to allow rallygoers to drink on public property, reasoning it will spread the bacchanalia into the open air.Only about 46% of adults in the county that hosts Sturgis are fully vaccinated, according to the CDC, compared with 60.6% nationwide. Vaccination rates were similarly low in the five counties where most 2020 rallygoers hailed from, according to an analysis of cellphone data from the Center for New Data. Only one — Maricopa County, Arizona — has cracked 50%. Campbell County in Wyoming, has the lowest rate, at just 27%.Vári, the biker from Hungary, said he's been fully vaccinated — but only because he falsely thought he needed proof of vaccination to get into the U.S."Sturgis or bust," he wrote on Facebook.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

Their hopes are now dashed after Greek officials said the team will not participate in the group or duet artistic swimming events.Greece will not compete in Olympic synchronized swimming in Tokyo after four of the team's athletes tested positive for the coronavirus. The entire team is now being sent away from the Olympic Village and transferred to a separate hotel, the Hellenic Olympic Committee said.The bad news came as the athletes' sport, officially called artistic swimming, was just entering its first days of competition.First came news that one athlete had tested positive; three more quickly followed. Clarifying its position after the flurry of tests,Greek officials saidthe team will not participate in either the group or duet artistic swimming events.The athletes who tested positive had not been showing symptoms of COVID-19 and are now in a special quarantine hotel, Greek officials said Tuesday.Greece's artistic swimming team had already been grappling with disruptions due to the coronavirus. Evangelia Platanioti, one of the country's star swimmers and a member of its duet team, tested positive in late July, forcing her to cancel plans to travel to Tokyo. The team inserted an alternate — but then Platanioti tested negative,rushed to Japan over the weekendand was reinstated to compete.Despite the last-minute changes, Platanioti and her partner, Evangelia Papazoglou, managed to finishin a tie for 10th placein preliminary rounds — good enough to advance.The organizing committee said there's little risk of infections spreading to other members of the Greek delegation, stating that from its arrival in the Olympic Village, the synchronized swimming team was not in direct contact with other athletes and staff.Since July 1, some 299 people with ties to the Olympics have tested positive for the coronavirus, according to thelatest tallyfrom Tokyo Games officials. That includes 179 residents of Japan and 120 nonresidents — and most cases have been found in contractors and staff rather than athletes.Tokyo officials said that as of the start of August, nearly 42,000 athletes, staff, media and other accredited people had arrived in Japan for the Summer Olympics.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

Starting next month, those plates will go only to indoor diners who can prove they have been vaccinated.Scott Heins/Getty Imageshide captionMasked kitchen workers pass plates of food to a server at Claro restaurant in February in New York City. Starting next month, those plates will go only to indoor diners who can prove they have been vaccinated.New York City will require workers and patrons at indoor businesses to show proof of vaccination starting on Sept. 13, becoming the first major U.S. city to take such action amid a surge of new cases nationwide driven by the highly transmissible delta variant.The new mandate announced Tuesday, dubbed the "Key to NYC Pass," will apply to indoor dining, gyms and entertainment venues."The Key to New York City. When you hear those words, I want you to imagine the notion that because someone's vaccinated they can do all the amazing things that are available in this city," said Mayor Bill de Blasio."But if you're unvaccinated, unfortunately, you will not be able to participate in many things," he added.City officials plan to spend the next few weeks soliciting feedback on the policy before launching it on Aug. 16. They will then educate businesses and the public about the new requirement before starting to enforce it come Sept. 13.People will be able to confirm they are vaccinated by showing their vaccine card. New Yorkers will also be able to show proof of inoculation using the city's NYC COVID SAFE App or New York state's Excelsior Pass.De Blasio said he's confident the new mandate is legal even though the Food and Drug Administration has only granted emergency use authorization for three COVID-19 vaccines but not full approval. "We got a very clear message from the U.S. Department of Justice that it was appropriate to move forward with these kinds of standards based on the existing approval," he said.City Health Commissioner Dr. Dave Chokshi said the city would take into consideration how the policy would affect children under age 12 who are not yet approved for the vaccine. "As with any policy of this type, there will have to be some reasonable accommodations made, and so that will be part of the discussion there," Chokshi added.De Blasio was joined during the virtual announcement by several business owners who applauded his decision to require vaccination among customers and staff."Many businesses cannot afford to live through another shutdown. So this is a good option for us," said Tren'ness Woods-Black of Sylvia's Restaurant in Harlem. "I know that folks feel a little way when it's mandated to take the vaccine, but it is a matter of life and death."The citypreviously mandatedthat all municipal workers get vaccinated or submit to weekly coronavirus testing.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Scott NeumanShoppers turn out heavily Monday at a supermarket in Wuhan, China, after nearby residential blocks went into lockdown as part of COVID-19 prevention measures.Feature China/Barcroft Media via Getty Imageshide captionShoppers turn out heavily Monday at a supermarket in Wuhan, China, after nearby residential blocks went into lockdown as part of COVID-19 prevention measures.In a dramatic move reminiscent of the first days of the coronavirus in China some 19 months ago, flights and trains in and out of Wuhan have been halted amid a rise in COVID-19 cases linked to the highly infectious delta variant of the virus.Authorities have also ordered mass testing in the city of 11 million, where the virus was first detected before it spread around the world. Panic-buying by worried residents followed new lockdowns there.China's latest outbreak, which began last month, is attributed to the highly infectious delta variant of the virus that has also been rapidly spreading across the U.S., causing the return of mask mandates and new urgency around the push for vaccination. Cases over the past two weeks have climbednearly 150%in the United States.In total, China has confirmed 328 new locally transmitted cases since anoutbreak that began last month, the state-controlledPeople's Dailyreported. The new infections have popped up in more than 35 cities in half of the country's provinces and regions, according to The Associated Press.At a news conference Tuesday, a Wuhan city official, Li Tao, portrayed the mass testing as a precautionary measure.Although officially, the latest outbreak appears relatively small, health authorities have reacted aggressively in an effort to keep the virus from regaining a foothold in the country. Since Wuhan first became the epicenter of the pandemic in 2019 and early 2020, China has moved to quash outbreaks whenever and wherever they occur, quickly implementing lockdowns and mass testing."Viral genome sequencing found all the strains to be the highly infectious Delta variant and cities hit by the recent resurgence have promptly taken action to curb the spread of the coronavirus,"People's Dailyreported.The eastern city of Yangzhou in Jiangsu province has had the highest daily count of new infections in China, with 40 newly confirmed cases there and in the neighboring city of Nanjing on Monday, according to theSouth China Morning Post.With just over a dozen local cases officially confirmed, residents and tourists in Zhangjiajie in Hunan province were ordered not to leave the city and cooperate with epidemic control measures as infections also spread there, state-runGlobal Timesreported.A government notice said that civil servants and public school teachers in Zhangjiajie were ordered to join local epidemic control teams, the newspaper said. "[T]heir performances will be part of their career reviews,"Global Timesreported.Authorities said they have administered more than 1.6 billion doses of a China-made vaccine.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Tamara KeithWill StoneContainers of Moderna vaccines donated by the U.S. arrive last week in Bogotá, Colombia.Leonardo Munoz/AFP via Getty Imageshide captionContainers of Moderna vaccines donated by the U.S. arrive last week in Bogotá, Colombia.The U.S. has delivered 110 million COVID-19 vaccine doses to 65 countries, from Afghanistan to Zambia, President Biden announced Tuesday at the White House.The U.S. donations prove that "democracies can deliver," Biden said. He added that the U.S. has acquired another 500 million Pfizer vaccines that will be donated to low- and middle-income countries by the end of the month, emphasizing that global vaccination is essential: "You can't build a wall high enough to keep us safe from COVID in other countries."These initial U.S. donated doses are just a first step for the projected 11 billion vaccines needed to vaccinate 70% of the world's population and bring the pandemic under control,according to the World Health Organization.And providing doses to other countries is a quasi-Herculean task. "Sharing vaccine doses isn't quite as easy as just putting them on a plane and calling somebody at the other end and telling them when they'll arrive," saidGayle Smith, the global COVID-19 response coordinator at the State Department.There have been some delays. Biden first announced that the U.S. would distribute 80 million doses to countries in need by the end of June,only later to say the goalhad simply been to "allocate" them by the end of June.Legal and regulatory hurdles loom for such sophisticated medical goods, Smith said — both for the U.S. to export them and for countries to receive them. And it's an urgent matter: Doses must be distributed before their expiration date, with cold chains set up to keep them from spoiling. Solutions have to be devised country by country, sometimes with elaborate legal agreements.On this global stage, the Biden administration can't call all the shots. "In some countries, it's actually required ... to take new laws to their parliaments so they can accept these vaccines, so it's a complicated logistical exercise, but I think we've shown it's entirely doable," Smith said in an interview with NPR.These first 100 million deliveries reflect Biden's effort to establish the U.S. as "the world's arsenal of vaccines" and are essentially a warmup for the hundreds of millions of shots that the U.S. has pledged to deliver later this year and next.The number of doses delivered so far puts the U.S. ahead of the combined total of every other country making donations, Biden said at the news conference  Tuesday. But the pace of the shipments is much slower than it should be, saidDr. Krishna Udayakumar,founding director of the Duke Global Health Innovation Center."When the world needs 10 billion doses to get to where we need to go, it puts that in context," he said. "We're a hundred times off where we need to be."Biden echoed that point at his news conference. "There's a need for several billion doses," he said Tuesday, noting that the U.S. will help countries such as India manufacture more vaccines in addition to donating doses.And certain parts of the world are severely lacking in vaccines. The breakdown of distribution at this point illustrates how far many countries are from any meaningful level of protection. Worldwide,fewer than 1% of vaccineshave gone to people in low-income countries, while more than 80% have been given to people in high- and upper middle-income countries.It’s great to see the US leading & sending more vaccines to Africa, which is grappling with a deadly third wave. It’s imperative that wealthy nations continue sharing more doses with Africa, where less than 2% of the population is fully vaccinated.https://t.co/W6nlEiWhpAAs the highly contagious delta variant surges, global health experts are calling for a bigger investment in the pandemic response."Right now, it doesn't seem like the effort is matching the level of crisis that some parts of the world are seeing," saidJenny Ottenhoff, senior policy director for global health and education at the ONE Campaign.The speed with which those doses arrive could determine the trajectory of the pandemic — and how many more people will die.The numbers are daunting. At least 800,000 COVID-19 fatalities are projected in the next two months,according to new estimatesfrom the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington.In an open letter released on Tuesday, a group of prominent global health experts wrote that the Biden administration and its G-7 allies have "taken important but modest steps to close the global vaccine gap," which still "fall far short of the true scale and urgency required."The letter urged the White House to ramp up U.S. donations quickly by at least 1 billion doses by mid-2022, strengthen global coordination of vaccine supply chains and pour resources into ensuring that "doses are translated into vaccinations."A man passes donated Johnson & Johnson vaccines after their arrival Friday at the Phnom Penh International Airport in Cambodia — the first batch of 1 million shots.Heng Sinith/APhide captionA man passes donated Johnson & Johnson vaccines after their arrival Friday at the Phnom Penh International Airport in Cambodia — the first batch of 1 million shots.As the Biden administration prepares to move hundreds of millions of more doses, the challenges in delivering these first 100 million doses should serve as a wake-up call, saidPrashant Yadav,a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development who studies health care supply chains."Just having surplus doses and a plan on how to allocate them is not sufficient. It requires a lot of other things to fall in place," Yadav said. "Similar types of logistical challenges will remain in place for that massive quantity. And so the bigger question is, are we now planning based on what we've learned?"In July, the White House released a "framework" for the pandemic response, but the Biden administration still seems to lack the kind of "superstructure" needed to manage the complex demands of the global vaccination campaign, saidStephen Morrisonat the Center for Strategic and International Studies, who also signed the letter."It's been somewhat ad hoc," he said. "We need to be staffed up at a higher level with a command-type approach, similar to what we've taken domestically, and we don't have that yet."The U.S. has the opportunity to take on a "more engaged" role with the global vaccination rollout, Yadav said. But that would require a much larger investment in the federal agencies currently orchestrating the vaccine-sharing programs, he said.A health worker vaccinates a woman last week in Thimphu, Bhutan.Upasana Dahal/AFP via Getty Imageshide captionA health worker vaccinates a woman last week in Thimphu, Bhutan.Smith said the aim is to "accelerate, accelerate, accelerate" to get more vaccines to more people faster."I don't want to understate in any way how proud all of us are that we not only hit the 80 million, but we are at 110," Smith said. "But I think none of us thinks that we can check the box now. There's still a massive amount to do. This last quarter of 2021 is critical. So we've got to keep going, and we've got to do more in any possible way we can do it."As long as the virus is moving faster than the drive to vaccinate the world, it is winning, she said.And that puts more pressure on the Biden administration. "Without U.S. leadership, I don't see another plausible pathway where we're going to turn the corner on this pandemic any time in the next six, 12 or 18 months," said Udayakumar of the Duke Global Health Innovation Center.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

The peak for deaths in the state happened in mid-August 2020 when 1,266 people died over the span of seven days.The state has become a new epicenter for the virus, as CDC data shows that new case numbers in Florida make up nearly a fifth of all new cases in the U.S. as the highly contagious delta variant of the coronavirus continues to spread.Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has opposed making masks mandatory across the state in addition to vaccine requirements. DeSantis, along with the state legislature, has limited the ability of local officials to enforce restrictions that public health officials say would help stop the spread of COVID-19.On Friday, DeSantissigned an executive orderbarring school districts from forcing students to wear a mask or face covering when they return to schools later this month.I signed an executive order directing@HealthyFlato enter rulemaking in collaboration with@EducationFLto protect parents' freedom to choose whether their children wear masks in schools.https://t.co/94ZMqObRasUnder the new order, parents will be able to choose whether their children will wear masks inside the classroom — despite the newly released guidance from the CDC that recommends everyone inside K-12 schools to wear a mask or face covering.Theme parks across Florida are also taking new measures to protect park visitors and staff.SeaWorld and Universal Orlando Resort have updated their masks requirements asking visitors, regardless of vaccination status, to begin wearing masks indoors and practice social distancing if possible."We encourage all guests – regardless of vaccination status – to wear face coverings while indoors,"according to Universal Orlando Resort's updated safety guidelines.SeaWorld posted on itswebsitethat it was recommending that visitors follow the recently updated recommendations given by CDC to wear face coverings while indoors.

There simply weren't enough people in the state willing to get their jab — even though cases and deaths from the delta variant are rising there at an alarming rate."Prior to the vaccine, I was heartsick because people died and we couldn't help them. Now, they don't get the vaccine and we can't help them," says Tammy Kellebrew, a pharmacist who travels to rural hospitals across the state. "And so after every death, I go back to the pharmacy and I cry, and then I go back to work."Town hall meetings are taking place throughout Arkansas to answer questions about COVID vaccines — and encourage people to sign up for one.

Just 36% of the state's 3 million people are fully vaccinated.The result of the vaccine resistance, along with the rise of the super-spreadable delta variant, is more COVID cases and more preventable deaths. Hospitals in Arkansas are againreaching critical capacity, and staff are exhausted.Kellebrew wore a mask with Dr. Anthony Fauci's face on it to a town hall meeting held by Hutchinson in her hometown of Dumas, a small, majority-Black city in the southeast delta region on July 27.

Jewell Brackett has been hesitant but says he might still get the vaccine.Liz Sanders for NPRhide captionReasons for vaccine resistance are diverse and many, saysCol. Robert Ator, who heads the state's vaccine distribution program. "What started out as being a logistics and distribution kind of an exercise has turned out to be psychology," he says. "Our targeting strategy has been to work down on the micro level, to work with individual communities to understand what is the barrier in that area and let us address those."For starters, there's a tide of misinformation along with distrust of the government. Debbie Reynolds attended the town hall in Heber Springs. She has not been vaccinated, and the meeting did not sway her. "They treat you like you're just too dumb to make good decisions for your family," she says. "How many people do you see laying around on the sidewalks and in their yards dying of COVID? Nowhere."The Dumas Family Pharmacy promotes COVID-19 vaccines in Dumas, Ark., a small city in the southeast delta region of the state.Liz Sanders for NPRhide captionThe Dumas Family Pharmacy promotes COVID-19 vaccines in Dumas, Ark., a small city in the southeast delta region of the state.The battle to get more people vaccinated often comes down to the efforts of individuals like Dollie Wilson, a 71-year-old missionary who attended the meeting in Dumas.

She has been trying to get every worker vaccinated at the city's various factories."I've been to all but one, and I'm trying to talk them into letting me come in," she says. "The plant manager has a lot of people who are leery of taking the vaccine for all various reasons. They're afraid it'll make them sick. They're afraid that they're conforming — that somebody's making them do something they don't want to do."Kellebrew, who administers shots at vaccination clinics across the state, says she's trying hard to calm people's specific fears.Once, at a grocery store, a woman told her she was nervous about getting the vaccine because of a rumor on the internet that it can make you magnetic. "I said, 'Do you really believe that?' And she said, 'Well, I'm not sure.' " Kellebrew recounts. So she found a magnet in the store and demonstrated on a person to whom she had just given  the shot. "The magnet kept falling off her arm, and I said, 'Is that what you needed to see?' And she said, 'Yes. I think I'll get a shot.' " Kellebrew now travels with a magnet.Violet Mallett waits in the Dumas Family Pharmacy after receiving the vaccine.

He says the governor's town hall meetings are encouraging people — and the delta variant is scaring them. But with the rapid spread of the delta variant, now representing almost 90% of the sequenced virus cases in Arkansas, he worries it may not be enough. "My biggest concern is we're going to be a month too late, and we're going to have a lot of people suffer because of it."State officials say that if they can find a way to punch through the hesitancy they're facing now, they could end up as a model for other slow-to-vaccinate parts of the nation as the delta variant spreads."There are a lot of places that may have higher vaccination rates than what we have in Arkansas, but they're certainly not high enough to suppress the spread of the delta variant," saysDr. Jennifer Dillaha, the state epidemiologist for Arkansas. "It may be just a matter of time before they get hit as well."The audio story was produced by Barry Gordemer.Editor's note: The 80,000 doses in Arkansas expected to expire in July was an estimate provided to NPR by the Arkansas Department of Health on July 29. After this story was published, a spokesperson for the Arkansas Department of Health wrote to say that the actual wastage turned out to be much lower, with only 5,744 doses expiring in July. The spokesperson attributed the gap between the expected and actual wasted doses to more complete reporting from vaccine providers and increased vaccination rates.

They all want to get out and have blast," says Sid Trivedi of Indiana.Tourists frequent swimming holes along a federal Bureau of Land Management trail east of Moab.Claire Harbage/NPRhide captionTourists frequent swimming holes along a federal Bureau of Land Management trail east of Moab.Trivedi and his family heard about the swimming holes from the guide they rented ATVs from. He had also researched the daily closures at the park and planned a day doing other things around Moab."It's crowded yeah, I came here six years ago, it wasn't crowded," he says. "In six years, it's just turned to really big crowd now, but it's fun."But locals are apt to give an earful that their favorite secret stashes like this are being overrun. Town is clogged with noisy off-road vehicles, they complain. Second homeowners and Airbnbs are pricing people out of an already tight housing market. Businesses don't have enough workers. And then, there's the camping, everywhere, even if it's posted as off-limits.In the 1950s, Moab was a sleepy uranium mining town. But a tourism-driven economy has brought with it traffic.Claire Harbage/NPRhide captionIn the 1950s, Moab was a sleepy uranium mining town. But a tourism-driven economy has brought with it traffic.Tourism is booming nationwide after the pandemic shutdowns were lifted. But some in Moab are wondering aloud these days whether you can have too much of a good thing."We're having a lot of problems with fire rings, with human waste. We've even gotten pictures of campers dumping their sewage right there," says Mary McGann, chair of the Grand County Commission.Moab was once held up as a national model for how to reinvent an economy based on tourism and recreation. When McGann first moved here as a little girl in the 1950s, it was a sleepy uranium mining town. That all went bust by the late 1980s. Soon after, some locals who had lost their jobs in the mines opened a mountain biking shop. Things quickly took off.Moab, which can be seen from Arches National Park, was once held up as a national model for how to reinvent an economy based on tourism and recreation.Claire Harbage/NPRhide captionMoab, which can be seen from Arches National Park, was once held up as a national model for how to reinvent an economy based on tourism and recreation."We moved toward tourism, and we were excited about it. We thought tourism won't have the environmental impact that mining has," McGann says. "In hindsight, I think tourism now is having more of a negative environmental impact on our surrounding areas."Thecurrent visitor crushhas caused local leaders to ask the question: Are we promoting ourselves too much?"It's a good problem to have, especially coming out of a pandemic and a couple of months of no income for a lot of folks," says Moab Mayor Emily Niehaus. "It's a good problem, but it's still a problem.""It's a good problem to have, especially coming out of a pandemic and a couple of months of no income for a lot of folks," says Moab Mayor Emily Niehaus.Claire Harbage/NPRhide caption"It's a good problem to have, especially coming out of a pandemic and a couple of months of no income for a lot of folks," says Moab Mayor Emily Niehaus.Some blame a Utah law that requires towns like this to spend most of their hotel tax money on marketing to bring more tourists to town. This year, local leaders did persuade state lawmakers to give them more flexibility to use some of this money to pay for tourist impacts. (Ironically, the law stems from the mining bust era when Moab lobbied the state to allow them to use more money for tourism promotion.)Leaders here are also pressuring the National Park Service to put a reservation system in place at Arches. But one of the biggest complaints heard is that there is hardly any enforcement of environmental rules on the federal public lands.There are only three federal law enforcement rangers patrolling this wild area that's larger than Delaware, a perennial problemnot unique to this corner of the West.The Colorado River runs just west of Moab along federal Bureau of Land Management land, which has seen a surge of visitors happy to be out of their homes.Claire Harbage/NPRhide captionThe Colorado River runs just west of Moab along federal Bureau of Land Management land, which has seen a surge of visitors happy to be out of their homes."Basically any flat spot on a busy weekend people are camped there, even if [it's] right next to the no camping sign," says Kerry Kelly, a part-time Moab resident and an assistant professor at the University of Utah.Kelly started speaking out in June after an illegal campfire ignited awildfire that later destroyed her homeand three others between Moab and the La Sal Mountains. There was a fire ban at the time. But Kelly says many new visitors are coming with little knowledge about nature or how dry the region is."People that grow up in the West know that would be a really bad idea to do that and it's prohibited," she says. "On the other hand, you might come from an area of the country that is much less flammable and you might not really understand that."Kelly says it's time for towns like this to put the brakes on marketing — and put more money into educating their guests and infrastructure to support their locals.

Kelly did not issue a mask mandate when speaking Wednesday from the state Capitol in Topeka.It's been difficult to make sense of all of the varying guidance and mandates on masking and vaccines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, states and local governments. But in Kansas, where cases are rising, it is also difficult to know who has the power to call the shots since Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly's executive authority remains in legal limbo.The state's Republican attorney general is expected to appeal a recent ruling saying that the Kansas Legislature's limits to Kelly's emergency powers are flawed and unenforceable, but the court fight has left confusion about the power of the governor and local public health officials to impose rules aimed at combating the pandemic.While awaiting a final decision, Kelly has yet to take forceful action in response to the resurging pandemic — such as mask mandates she'd issued in the past that could slow the state's economic recovery and that would surely draw strong resistance.In March, the governorcompromisedwith state lawmakers, agreeing to give up some of her power. When she issued another statewide mask mandate, a panel of state lawmakers voted it down 5-2. By early April, the number of counties withmask mandates droppedto seven, down from 57 in February.Now, the delta variant of the coronavirus has 84 of the 105 counties in the state caught in a regional hot zone, and none of the 105 has mask mandates in place. Meanwhile, more than half of all eligible Kansans are not vaccinated.The Kansas Department of Health and Environmentreportedmore than 2,000 new COVID-19 cases since Wednesday, most of which are the result of the new ultra-contagious delta variant.But on Wednesday, Kelly stopped short of issuing another statewide mask mandate. Instead, she chose to coax.Even vaccinated Kansans, she said, ought to wear masks indoors in 84 of Kansas' 105 counties. Her guidance mirrored earlier advice from the CDC. She did require most state workers to wear masks on the job."I'm as frustrated as any other vaccinated Kansan," Kelly said. "I feel like I did my part. And one of the rewards of that was not having to wear a mask.""But that option has now been taken away," she said, "because of the delta variant and how much more contagious it is, and how few Kansans, unfortunately, have gotten vaccinated."Aften Gardner is the health administrator for rural Wallace County, where there's never been a countywide mask mandate. With 34% of her population fully vaccinated, Gardner said she's worried again.She's also president of the Kansas Association of Local Health Departments. Gardner said in her opinion nobody wants to draw residents' ire by imposing a mask mandate or repurposing pandemic restrictions — not the governor, not local health officials and certainly not county commissioners. Doing so would provoke surefire vitriol."The attitude is very much, 'This is a free country. I'm not gonna make you do anything. You have every right to mask up, but you can't tell me to do anything.' That's pretty much the stance."She said over the course of the pandemic, the health department's working relationship with county partners and community members "has pretty much been destroyed.""We have been labeled the bad guys," Gardner said. In fact, around 30% of Kansas' health officers and administratorshave left their jobsduring the pandemic, many after personal attacks for the public health policies they were the face of.That same anger has also been directed at the governor. When reporters asked Kelly if she'd consider reimposing a statewide mask mandate, she deflected."We don't want to spend a lot of energy thinking about that," she said, "or diluting our resources in ways that will distract from getting these shots in arms. "But until the state Supreme Court weighs in, it's hard to know if Kelly's reluctance to act is a question of legal authority or political will.Her executive authority to respond to emergencies has been hollowed out over the course of the pandemic.The conservative supermajority in the Kansas Legislature passedlawsshifting the state's pandemic response to local county commissions, hamstringing the ability of Kelly and local health officials to respond.One of thenew lawsrequired speedy judicial review for anyone with a grievance of a mask policy or restriction issued by a school board or local government. In the case of a disagreement between a parent and a school board, a court had to hold a hearing on the issue in three days and issue an order within seven.Kelly's power atrophied so greatly under the law that Republican leaders were able tosupersede her requests to extend the state of emergencyin June.However, some power could be restored if the state Supreme Court rules in her favor, agreeing with a lower court ruling that the Kansas Legislature was stepping on the toes of the judicial branch and depriving local governments of due process."It is the ultimate legislative stick intended to goad and/or supplant judicial rules and functions," Johnson County District Judge David Hauber wrote. "It promotes the equivalent of legal anarchy."With Kansas Attorney General Derek Schmidt expected to appeal, he contends the ruling prompted "unnecessary and disruptive confusion," potentially making it difficult for the state to respond to a future disaster emergency. He said it "invited the very sort of 'legal anarchy' that troubled the court."In her Wednesday news conference, Kelly deflected questions about whether she thought local health officials had the authority to respond to the pandemic."I'm gonna leave that to the local units of government and the school boards to decide how they want to interpret what the judge's ruling does," Kelly said.A later statement said, "Our office does not want to speculate until a decision is reached by the Kansas Supreme Court, which we anticipate will happen soon."Dennis Kriesel, executive director of the Kansas Association of Local Health Departments, said that the district court decision likely doesn't apply statewide.Local health officers can do things such as issue a mask mandate and limit the size of gatherings with or without the law. But under the law in limbo, they'd have to get the blessing of their county officials, and commissioners in two of Kansas City's largest metro counties have beenreluctant to sign on to recommendationsfor temporary mask mandates."In terms of the ability to issue orders, we have more flexibility now than we did two months ago," Kriesel said. "That being said, I don't think we're going to see nearly the amount of aggressive ordering that we saw in the fall of last year because of the backlash."Regardless of who has the authority to respond, Kriesel said, public health officials are looking for political cover."You could probably, on one hand," he said, "count the number of local health officers that would be willing to issue an order without knowing what their commissioners' stance was."Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
Vanessa RomoThe "performative activism" by Americans Jacob Hoyle and Curtis McDowald on Friday was the latest criticism over allowing a man accused of sexual assault to attend the Olympics.Elsa/Getty Imageshide captionThe "performative activism" by Americans Jacob Hoyle and Curtis McDowald on Friday was the latest criticism over allowing a man accused of sexual assault to attend the Olympics.The American fencing team is not happy to have Alen Hadzic representing the U.S. at the Tokyo Olympics.Almost immediately after making it on to the roster, the 29-year-old was accused of sexual misconduct between 2013 and 2015 by three women.Hadzic denies the allegations and successfully appealed a suspension that would have kept him off the U.S. team.On Friday, the men's team conveyed their displeasure to the world, wearing pink face masks in support of sexual assault victims. It made for a striking image as Jake Hoyle, Curtis McDowald and Yeisser Ramirez appeared in the light-colored masks, while Hadzic was the odd-man-out in black.#TeamUSAmen’s epee team wore pink masks for their opening match at the Olympics as a show of support for sexual assault victims. Alen Hadzic— their teammate accused of rape and sexual assault— is on the left. Kudos to the team for taking a stand.#BelieveWomenpic.twitter.com/yRI4azelKNJackie Dubrovich, an Olympic fencer who was in Tokyo, called the move by her teammates "PERFORMATIVE ACTIVISM" on Instagram. She called for accountability."THE PEOPLE/SYSTEMS WHO ENABLED & PROTECTED A VIOLENT PREDATOR ARE NOT BEING HELD ACCOUNTABLE," she wrote. "FEMALE ATHLETES WERE NOT PROTECTED & OUR SAFETY WAS DEEMED UNIMPORTANT."Hadzic had been suspended from all fencing activities by the U.S. Center for SafeSport, an independent agency that investigates sexual abuse in Olympic sports. But weeks later, an arbitrator ruled that the suspension was "inappropriate to the allegations,"The New York Timesreported.It was also decided that Hadzic's addition to Team USA would not be "detrimental to the reputation of the United States or his sport."The decision enraged his teammates who called into question the efficacy of SafeSport, tasked with protecting the athletes.In an email obtained byUSA Today, Kris Ekeren, CEO of USA Fencing, wrote to Hadzic, saying his teammate disagreed with SafeSport's assessment."Nevertheless, team athletes have expressed concerns for their safety and well-being arising from your presence, which they say are likely to adversely affect their mental and emotional abilities to prepare and compete at the highest levels required for success in the Olympic Games," Ekerenwrote."Several have asked that USA Fencing put measures in place to keep them safe and minimize distractions from training and competition. Accordingly, USA Fencing, in conjunction with the USOPC, will implement a safety plan for the upcoming Olympic Games."Hadzic was prohibited from staying in the Olympic Village. Instead, he's been staying at a hotel nearby. He also was forced to travel to Tokyo separately from his teammates and forbidden from practicing with female teammates.Hadzic's lawyer, Michael Palma, says USA Fencing is keeping the Olympian out of sight to avoid negative publicity. The result, Palma toldThe New York Times,is keeping him "from participating in the Olympic experience that he has rightfully earned."In the end, Hadzic, an alternate on the men's epee team, did not compete in the Games.  The U.S. team lost to Japan on Friday andfinished ninth.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
   
The Associated PressSpectators attend a Broadway parade honoring essential workers earlier this month in New York.John Minchillo/APhide captionSpectators attend a Broadway parade honoring essential workers earlier this month in New York.NEW YORK — Broadway theatergoers will need to prove they've been vaccinated for COVID-19 and masks will be requiredwhen theaters reopenin the coming weeks, producers announced Friday.Audience members will have to wear face coverings and show proof they are fully vaccinated by a FDA or WHO authorized vaccine when they enter the theaters until at least the end of October, the Broadway League said in a news release."Get vaccinated, and we'll see you in the fall," tweeted Broadway and TV star Jeremy Jordan. Composer Jason Robert Brown also agreed with the move: "That's right. That's where we're at."There will be exceptions to the vaccine rule for children under 12, who are not yet eligible for any of the approved shots, and for people with a medical condition or religious belief that prevents vaccination, the theater operators said. Those individuals will need to show proof of a negative COVID-19 test. Masks are required for the audience except while eating or drinking in designated locations.The League said theater owners anticipate a review of the safety policies in September and may include a relaxation of certain provisions if the science dictates after October."This is what we have as a community on Broadway decided and then we're going to reevaluate it in October. It's still fluid," Bonnie Comley, board president of The Drama League, told The Associated Press. "This should be a positive thing. All these different unions that don't always agree have come together to be able to do this before people come into the theater."The move comes a day after Actors' Equity Association, the union which represents nearly 52,000 actors and stage managers, said it would require cast and crew members to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19.Company members who are not vaccinated, including those under the age of 12, must continue to wear masks, practice physical distancing when possible and undergo testing at least twice a week. The protocols apply to both Broadway productions and Equity-backed shows across the nation.Bruce Springsteen's one-man show  is the only performance currently running on Broadway. Antoinette Chinonye Nwandu's "Pass Over" is set to open Wednesday at the August Wilson Theatre. Most other theaters will open in September or October after being shuttered since the coronavirus pandemic hit in March 2020.Ticket holders for performances scheduled through Oct. 31 will be notified of the vaccination policy, Broadway League officials said. For performances in November 2021 and beyond, the theater operators will review the policy and made changes if science dictates, they said."As vaccination has proven the most effective way to stay healthy and reduce transmission, I'm pleased that the theatre owners have decided to implement these collective safeguards at all our Broadway houses," Broadway League President Charlotte St. Martin said in a statement.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

A study of a new outbreak in Provincetown found that three-quarters of those infected with the virus were fully vaccinated.Maddie Meyer/Getty Imageshide captionPedestrians and cyclists head down Commercial Street in Provincetown, Mass., in May 2020. A study of a new outbreak in Provincetown found that three-quarters of those infected with the virus were fully vaccinated.Whenrevising its mask guidancethis week to urge even vaccinated people to wear masks indoors in much of the country, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was criticized for not citing data in making that move.Now it has — and the data is sobering.Thestudy details a COVID-19 outbreakthat started July 3 in Provincetown, Mass., involving 469 cases. It found that three-quarters of cases occurred in fully vaccinated people. Massachusetts has a high rate of vaccination: about 69% among eligible adults in the state at the time of the study.It also found no significant difference in the viral load present in the breakthrough infections occurring in fully vaccinated people and the other cases, suggesting the viral load of vaccinated and unvaccinated persons infected with the coronavirus is similar.The CDC said the finding that fully vaccinated people could spread the virus was behind its move to change its mask guidance."High viral loads suggest an increased risk of transmission and raised concern that, unlike with other variants, vaccinated people infected with Delta can transmit the virus," Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the CDC's director, said in a statement Friday."This finding is concerning and was a pivotal discovery leading to CDC's updated mask recommendation. The masking recommendation was updated to ensure the vaccinated public would not unknowingly transmit virus to others, including their unvaccinated or immunocompromised loved ones," Walensky said.The good news is that the vaccines continue to be highly effective against the virus in preventing hospitalization and death from COVID-19. For instance, three studies from Canada, Singapore and Scotland have found that the Pfizer vaccine provides more than 90% protection against hospitalization and death.Indeed, the Provincetown outbreak demonstrates the vaccines' effectiveness.Alex Morse, town manager of Provincetown,said on Twitter that of the some 900 casesnow linked to the cluster, "there have been no deaths, 7 hospitalizations, and the symptoms are largely mild.""Our positivity peaked at 15% on 7/15 and was only 4.8% yesterday. The outbreak is contained and Provincetown is safe," Morse added.As the delta variant continues to spread rapidly through the U.S., the CDC updated mask guidance now recommends people wear masks when inside public spaces in areas where the spread of the virus is "substantial" or "high," regardless of one's vaccination status.Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
